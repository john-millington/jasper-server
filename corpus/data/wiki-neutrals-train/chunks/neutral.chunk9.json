He conceived and designed the animation for the film Howl (2010).'' Drooker grew up in Manhattan's Stuyvesant Town, adjacent to the Lower East Side, which was then a working-class immigrant neighborhood with a tradition of left-wing political activism. He attended the Downtown Community School in Manhattan's East Village. Drooker developed an early interest in graphic arts and cartoons, particularly the woodcut novels of Frans Masereel and Lynd Ward and the underground comics of Robert Crumb. After studying sculpture at Cooper Union, Drooker turned to poster art, creating flyers on local political issues while working as a tenant organizer. His images, done in a striking black-and-white style reminiscent of Masereel and other 1930s expressionist illustrators, were widely copied and reused by others&mdash;sometimes for unrelated purposes such as advertising concerts&mdash;and were popular enough that he could make a small income selling artwork on the street. During the 1980s, Drooker was further radicalized by his experiences with the police, due to their actions against squatters in the rapidly gentrifying Tompkins Square Park area and their increasing intolerance of unlicensed street artists and musicians. His first published work appeared in leftist magazines such as The Nation, The Progressive, and various underground publications such as Screw. His work would later be seen in such mainstream publications as The New York Times, Newsweek, and The Wall Street Journal; and his paintings would appear on dozens of covers of The New Yorker. When World War 3 Illustrated was founded by Seth Tobocman and Peter Kuper, who shared Drooker's political beliefs and graphic approach, Drooker became one of the magazine's co-editors and frequent contributors. Eventually he began to sell illustrations to more mainstream publications, and became more widely known as a cartoonist when his short story \"L\" appeared in Heavy Metal. \"L\", along with two other stories, made up his first graphic novel, ''Flood! A Novel in Pictures'';a wordless, dream-like narrative of powerless citizens' struggles with authority in a rapidly deteriorating New York City&mdash;which won an American Book Award. In the 1990s, Drooker broadened his scope from graphic arts to painting, creating several covers for The New Yorker and a book of illustrations of Allen Ginsberg's poetry, Illuminated Poems. His third book, Street Posters & Ballads, is a compilation of graphics, poems and songs about the Lower East Side. Portions of his Flood! artwork were used for the album covers for the bands Faith No More and Rage Against the Machine. He designed the animation for the 2010 film, Howl, a movie based on the epic poem by Allen Ginsberg, who collaborated with Drooker on the book Illuminated Poems. His best-selling book, Howl: A Graphic Novel visualizes the poem with animation art Drooker designed for the film. In 2006, the Library of Congress acquired the original art for ''Flood! A Novel in Pictures'', including preliminary drawings, sketches and cover paintings. The complete Flood!

In the continental United States, tent revivals have ranged from small, locally based tents holding as few as a hundred people to large organizations with a fleet of trucks and tents able to hold thousands. Most tent revivals in the U.S. have been held by Pentecostal or Holiness Christians who not only adhered to evangelicalism but believed in speaking in tongues, healing the chronically ill, and in some cases resurrecting the dead. As radio and television began to play an increasingly important part in American culture, some preachers such as Oral Roberts, a very successful tent revivalist, made the transition to these media. Such pioneers were the early televangelists. Other evangelists who have been noted for their continued use of tents in crusades include David Terrell, R.W. Schambach, Reinhard Bonnke and J. A.

He originally joined the Royal Flying Corps as a 17-year-old courier. He was assigned to No. 4 Squadron in France. A year and a half later, he underwent pilot's training. He was then forwarded to a Sopwith Camel unit, No. 65 Squadron. On 25 April 1918, he was shot down by Josef Mai. On 10 May 1918, he scored his first victory by destroying an Albatros D.V. He became an ace on 29 June. He flew 102 offensive patrols in six months, and steadily accumulated victories through 9 November 1918. His final total included victories over 14 enemy fighters and a reconnaissance two-seater. He was also a balloon buster, having shot down three enemy observation balloons. Between the wars, Newnham was involved with the Triumph motorcycle and automobile company. As early as 1933, he stocked them in his automotive sales center. He was appointed to head it in 1936 as managing director and chief executive. He sold off the motorcycle division and turned the company from producing sports cars to building nondescript family sedans. This policy put the company in serious financial straits, as the sedan market was overcrowded. The Bombing of Coventry destroyed the motorcycle plant and damaged the automobile factory seriously enough to shut down production. Newnham returned to service during World War II, rejoining the RAF on 11 November 1939 as a pilot officer (probationary), with the service number 75897. He was confirmed in his rank the following 11 November, having been promoted to war-substantive flying officer on 22 February 1940.

It has sometimes been dated as early as the 8th or 9th century. Its authorship is unknown. The third-person narrative describes a vision of heaven and hell attributed to Adamnán (d. 704 AD), abbot of Hy and Iona, and primary biographer of Saint Columba.

It is the earliest Irish visionary work to use the literary device of a bridge that souls must cross as part of a sorting ordeal, and marks the origin of visionary literature about the trials of the spiritual pilgrim in the Irish tradition. The Vision of Adamnán influenced the Hiberno-Latin Vision of Tundale, which was widely disseminated in various languages, and was a precursor to the Divine Comedy of Dante in describing a tripartite otherworld through which the pilgrim is escorted by a spiritual guide.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Karkatak () is a village in Sakht Sar Rural District, in the Central District of Ramsar County, Mazandaran Province, Iran.

At Agrae on the Ilissos, where she was believed to have first hunted after her arrival from Delos, Artemis Agrotera had a temple, dating to the 5th century BC, with a statue carrying a bow. During the Boedromia, on the seventh day of Boedromion (roughly, the beginning of September), an armed procession would take 600 goats to this temple, where they would all be sacrificed by the polemarch in honor of the victory at the Battle of Marathon. This rite derived from a vow made before the Battle of Marathon, which in turn derived from the custom of making a \"slaughter sacrifice\", or sphagion (), to Artemis Agrotera before a battle. The temple was destroyed in 1778, when the Ottoman forces occupying Athens set about demolishing ancient sites for building material to construct a wall around the city. The ruins of the temple survive today on Ardettou Street, tightly surrounded by modern buildings. There is an ongoing campaign for the expropriation of adjacent buildings and the restoration of the temple. Under this name Agrotera was also worshiped at Aigeira, Sparta, and elsewhere.

The remnant church is a visible, historical, organized body characterized by obedience to the commandments of God and the possession of a unique end-time gospel proclamation. Adventists have traditionally equated this \"remnant church\" with the Seventh-day Adventist denomination. A distinct but related concept is the eschatological remnant, which will be manifest shortly prior to the second coming of Jesus. The \"remnant church\" is understood to act as a catalyst for the formation of this group. The eschatological remnant will consist of some (but not all) constituents of the present \"remnant church\", together with a cohort of believers from other (that is, non-Adventist) churches. Only members of the eschatological remnant will be saved through the end-times. Traditionally, Adventists have also applied the symbol of \"Laodicea\" to themselves, a self-criticism as being \"lukewarm\" in the faith (Revelation 3:15-16). The Adventist doctrine of the end-time remnant is based primarily upon Revelation 12:17, which states: And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. (King James Version, emphasis added) An estimated 90% of Adventists believe \"The Adventist Church has a special mission to proclaim God’s last message to the world\", according to estimates of local church leaders in a 2002 worldwide survey.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Las Ruteras is a 1968 Argentine film.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"is a Japanese rock musician and Seiun Award-winning writer.

It is the site of numerous events and festivities. A Berlin(Kitchener) map from 1879 has a park called Town Park, located between Mill Street and Highland Road where Highland Courts and Woodside Parks stand today. It sits on the original Joseph E. Schneider homestead. Victoria Park opened in 1896, the park was built mostly on swampy farm land. The man-made lake is fed by Schneider Creek, surrounds three small islands, and is crossed by multiple bridges, one dating to the creation of the park. The park also contains the Victoria Park pavilion, the Victoria Park Gallery and Archives, a bandstand, and a historic boathouse, now a pub and music venue. The Gaukel street entrance features a clock tower which was once atop the old Kitchener City Hall (from 1924 and now site of Market Square Shopping Centre), and before that, the town's fire hall. It was moved to the park entrance and complemented with a fountain and a sculpture of luggage, by local artist Ernest Daetwyler, symbolizing the various waves of immigration that have contributed the city's history. A cast-bronze statue of Queen Victoria by Cavaliere Raffaele Zaccaquini and a cannon are situated in the park. The statue was unveiled in May 1911, on Victoria Day on the ten year anniversary of her death. The Princess of Wales Chapter of the IODE raised the $6,000 needed for the monument. In 1897, a large bronze bust of Kaiser Wilhelm I was installed to honour the region's prominent German-Canadian population, but it was removed and thrown into the lake by vandals in August 1914 at the beginning of the First World War. The bust was recovered from the lake and moved to the nearby Concordia club, but it was stolen again February 15, 1916, marched through the streets by a mob, made up largely of soldiers from the 118th Battalion, and has never been seen again. The 118th Battalion is rumoured to have melted down the bust to make napkin rings given to its members. In the fall of 2011, $10.1-million of restoration work on the park's lake was started, and in all 85,000 tonnes of sediment were removed from the lake bottom. Thousands of concrete and stone blocks were placed along the 2.2 kilometres of shoreline as a retaining wall to prevent erosion. While the overall area of the lake was slightly reduced, the waterway near the mouth of Schneider's creek at the north end of the park was widened to create a \"fore bay\" which slows the flow of water and allows sediment to settle in one place for easy removal.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Yannick Bertrand (born 18 August 1980) is a French alpine skier who competed in the 2006 Winter Olympics.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Akaflieg Braunschweig SB-7 Nimbus is a Standard class glider designed and built in Germany in the 1960s.

It was released by Epic Records as the lead single from the album. The Spanish-language version features Dominican rapper El Cata, and was released on 10 September 2010, while the English-language version features British rapper Dizzee Rascal, and was released on 13 September 2010. It was written and produced by Shakira, with additional songwriting from Edward Bello, Armando Pérez, and Dylan Mills. The song is a Latin pop and merengue track that lyrically describes Shakira's eccentric infatuation with a man. In August 2014, a senior US district judge found \"Loca\" to have been indirectly plagiarised from \"Loca con su Tiguere\", a mid-1990s song composed by Dominican songwriter Ramon \"Arias\" Vasquez. The case was dismissed in August 2015 after it was found that Vasquez had fabricated the evidence he had presented in court. Upon its release, \"Loca\" received generally favourable reviews from music critics, who complimented the inclusion of merengue music on the recording. The English version of the song became a worldwide commercial success and peaked inside the top five of the record charts of countries including Austria, Belgium, France, Hungary and Italy. The Spanish version peaked atop the charts of Spain and Switzerland, and became a hit on the Latin record charts in the United States, topping the Billboard Hot Latin Songs, Latin Pop Airplay, and Tropical Songs charts. \"Loca\" received record certifications in various countries around the world, including a diamond certification in Colombia and multi-platinum certifications in Italy, Mexico, and Spain. Its accompanying music video was filmed in Barcelona, Spain in August 2010, and was released the following month. It features Shakira interacting with a beach crowd, and dancing in front of the sea wearing a golden bikini. It generated a favourable response from critics, many of whom praised its concept for matching the vibe of the song. For additional promotion, Shakira performed \"Loca\" on several television shows and on her The Sun Comes Out World Tour.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Pakanha (Bakanha), or Ayabakan, is a nearly extinct Paman language spoken on the Cape York Peninsula of Queensland, Australia.

NLC phases are generally tetragonal and are composed of two separate sublattices. The first is a tetragonal array of transition metal atoms, generally from group 4 through group 9 of the periodic table. Contained within this array of transition metal atoms is a second network of main group atoms, typically from group 13 (boron group) or group 14 (carbon group). The transition metal atoms form a chimney with helical zigzag chain. The main-group elements form a ladder spiraling around the transition metal helix. The phase is named after one of the early investigators H. Nowotny. Examples are RuGa 2, Mn 4 Si 7 , Ru 2 Ge 3 , Ir 3 Ga 5 , Ir 4 Ge 5 V 17 Ge 31 , Cr 11 Ge 19 , Mn 11 Si 19 , Mn 15 Si 26 , Mo 9 Ge 16 , Mo 13 Ge 23 , Rh 10 Ga 17 , and Rh 17 Ge 22 . In RuGa 2 the ruthenium atoms in the chimney are separated by 329 pm. The gallium atoms spiral around the Ru chimney with a Ga–Ga intrahelix distance of 257 pm. The view perpendicular to the chimney axis is that of a hexagonal lattice with gallium atoms occupying the vertices and ruthenium atoms occupying the center. Each gallium atom bonds to 5 other gallium atoms forming a distorted trigonal bipyramid. The gallium atoms carry a positive charge and the ruthenium atoms have a formal charge of &minus;2 (filled 4d shell). In Ru 2 Sn 3 the ruthenium atoms spiral around the tin inner helix. In two dimension the Ru atoms form a tetragonal lattice with the tin atoms appearing as triangular units in the Ru channels. The occurrence of a LCP phase can be predicted by the so-called 14 electron rule. In it the total number of valence electrons per transition metal atom is 14.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Hungary national rugby league team, known as the Magyar Bulls, represents Hungary in the sport of rugby league football.

The word dumog is most commonly used in Mindanao and the Visayas, while the word buno is used in Luzon, specifically in the Southern Tagalog-speaking provinces as far south as Mindoro. Tribal groups such as the Ifugao, Samal, Igorot, Ibanag, Manobo, Dumagat, and Maranao are said to practice grappling arts known respectively as bultong, silaga, dama, garong, buteng, purgos, and kapulubod; while ethnic groups such as the Tagalog, Ilokano, Cebuano, Bicolano, Pampanga, and Pangasinan, are said to practice grappling arts known as gabbo, layung, lampugan, pantok, balsakan, and dumog. Techniques encompass a variety of pushes, pulls, weight shifts and joint locks designed to \"move\" the opponent, often taking advantage of their weight and direction of force to throw them off balance. Dumog is based on the concept of “control points” or “choke points” on the human body, which are manipulated – for example: by grabbing, pushing, pulling - in order to disrupt the opponent’s balance and to keep him off balance. This also creates opportunities for close quarter striking using head butts, knees, forearms and elbows. Dumog also contains methods of joint-locking and choking, as well as takedowns, throws and submission holds. Dumog techniques can be assisted by the environment around you, a wall, lampost or vehicle for example, which helps to immobilise the opponent, or hurt him further by collision with the object. Similarly, Dumog techniques can be used to manipulate an opponent for use as a shield to protect yourself during a multiple attacker scenario, or to quickly move an unwanted person from an area, much like security or law enforcement “come-along” type techniques. Pain compliance is an important aspect of any grappling art. Hence, Dumog techniques can be complimented by nerve point attacks, as well as Kino-mutai which is the term generally used to include pinching, biting, gouging, ripping/tearing methods. Dumog is taught in most Filipino Martial Arts styles as a small addition to their vast syllabus. However, there are a small handful of FMA based systems such as Harimaw Buno, Apolaki Krav Maga & Dirty Boxing and Garimot Buno whose training focuses on training the art of dumog in much more detail.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Lautaro Lodge () was a revolutionary secret lodge active in Latin American politics in the 19th Century.

It was inaugurated in 1973 by then Governor General of Canada Roland Michener. The award was created to provide recognition for Scouts when the Scout program was divided into the Scout and Venturer sections. The former Queen's/Kings's Scout award was renamed as the Queen's Venturer Award, and is the highest award that can be achieved in the Scouting youth program in Canada. Speaking to the prestige of the award, at least one known Chief Scout has gone on to win a Nobel Prize, 4 have become Members of Parliament (currently one sitting MP Frank Baylis) and at least 1 has been a Premier. Others have become titans of industry, technology, academia, finance and media. In order to earn the award a Scout must earn the Voyageur and Pathfinder Activity Awards which require the Scout to develop citizenship, leadership, personal development and outdoor skills, as well as earn ten Challenge badges, at least one in each of the seven categories (athletics, outdoors, home and family, personal development, science and technology, culture and society, and environment); they must in addition hold current qualifications in Standard First Aid, hold the World Scout Environment Badge, investigate and present findings on Scouts Canada's involvement in World Scouting, design a challenging programme which will require the Scout to excel in each of the four activity areas (Citizenship, Leadership, Personal Development, and Outdoor Skills), including at least 30 hours of additional leadership to others (above those required in the Citizenship Activity area of the Voyageur and Pathfinder awards). In working towards the Chief Scout's Award, the Scout will have performed over 30 hours of service in the community, much of it self-directed. They have met with a local service agency and together have discussed and made plans for future improvements in the community. Additional work on the World Scout Environment Badge exposes a Chief Scout's Award candidate to the many environmental issues of today, and they have taken an active role in promoting those issues with the public. Chief Scout's Award candidates amass more than 100 kilometers in hiking camps and they spend time as trainers helping their fellow Scouts work on their own badge levels. Scouts Canada has, in the past, proposed replacing the award with a membership to the Queen Elizabeth Jubilee Youth Ensemble after completion of the same requirements, but lacking the required signatures of 250 Chief Scout recipients, this has yet to be approved.

In 1896, he co-founded the Cella, Adler, and Tilles investment syndicate, alongside partners Cap Tilles and Samuel Adler. The partnership, also known as C.A.T., dominated the Midwestern horse racing industry through World War I. At its height, C.A.T. had a controlling interest in 25 horse racing tracks. Additionally, C.A.T. founded the Western Turf Association, which granted Cella and his partners near monopolistic control over jockeys, bookmakers, and horse owners in the Midwest. The partnership also had one of the largest networks of bucketshops in the US, with a presence in every major city in the country. Cella was nicknamed the \"Dago Saloonkeeper,\" a reference to his early start as a saloonist before co-founding C.A.T. Cella made a fortune in real estate, commodities speculation, stock commissions, and horse racing. At the height of his career, Cella owned five large office buildings, controlled ten theaters, several hotels, and a large network of brokerages across the US. From 1897 to 1904, Cella and his two partners had a monopoly on the St. Louis horse racing market. In 1905, gambling was abolished in Missouri after passage of the Anti-Breeders Act, and the partnership's tracks were legally forced to cease operations. Following the progressive movement's prohibition on gambling in Missouri, Cella turned his primary attention to real estate speculation and the Cella Commission Company he co-founded with his brothers. In 1910, Cella was arrested by federal marshals and extradited to Washington D.C. in the Western Union bucket shop scandal. During the trial, the prosecuting federal attorney accused Cella of perjury, which was added to the charges against him. In 1911, Cella and his investment partners were acquitted of all charges, after the Anti-Bucket Shop Act was declared unconstitutional.

Meir Ronnen was born in Melbourne, as Meir Isaacman. His father was born in Jerusalem, Palestine, and his mother in Liverpool, UK. He studied art and architecture at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Melbourne. During the Second World War he was recruited to the Australian Army, and after the war was stationed in occupied Japan as a staff member of a military newspaper, BCON, where he had a weekly column \"In a mess by Mike\". In 1945–46 he drew portraits of Japanese war criminals at the hearings of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo. Back in Australia, he worked as a cartoonist for The Sunday Telegraph. In 1949 Ronnen emigrated to Israel and joined the staff of the daily newspaper, \"The Palestine Post\", which soon after accepted his proposal to change its title to The Jerusalem Post. His first assignment was to draw maps, but his talent as an illustrator was soon recognized, and he began illustrating articles and drawing cartoons for the paper on a daily basis. In 1956, he adopted the Hebrew name 'Ronnen' upon being appointed emissary of the Jewish Agency to South Africa and Rhodesia. Upon his return to Israel in 1958, he was asked to establish the International Edition of The Jerusalem Post and to continue as cartoonist and art editor of the Israel Edition. In his position as art editor, which continued until 2008, he wrote thousands of articles, including book reviews on topics ranging from art to science to Judaica to history, a column on the happenings of the international auction houses, and reviews of both local and international exhibitions. He also drew a daily political cartoon for the Jerusalem Post, and illustrated and published numerous books.

Although estimates vary, the death toll was at least 71,000 people, of which 11,000–12,000 were killed directly by the eruption.

In the Northern Hemisphere, crops failed and livestock died, resulting in the worst famine of the century. During a 2004 excavation, archaeologists discovered the remains of a civilization destroyed and buried by the 1815 eruption.

Liberty ships were designed to be used solely for World War II, whereas Victory ships were designed to last longer and to serve the US Navy after the war. Victory ships differed from Liberty ships in that they were faster, longer, wider, taller, and had a thinner stack set farther toward the superstructure. In addition, they had a long raised forecastle.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Arnold \"Arnie\" Binder is an American sociologist, criminologist, and Professor Emeritus of Criminology, Law & Society at the University of California, Irvine, where he founded the School of Social Ecology in 1970.

Emphasis was placed, as the name indicates, on learning to use Latin. The education given at Latin schools gave great emphasis to the complicated grammar of the Latin language, initially in its Medieval Latin form. Grammar was the most basic part of the trivium and the Liberal arts — in artistic personifications Grammar's attribute was the birch rod. Latin school prepared students for university, as well as enabling those of middle class status to rise above their station. It was therefore not unusual for children of commoners to attend Latin schools, especially if they were expected to pursue a career within the church. Although Latin schools existed in many parts of Europe in the 14th century and were more open to the laity, prior to that the Church allowed for Latin schools for the sole purpose of training those who would one day become clergymen. Latin schools began to develop to reflect Renaissance humanism around the 1450s. In some countries, but not England, they later lost their popularity as universities and some Catholic orders began to prefer the vernacular.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"is a fictional character in the Macross Japanese animated science fiction series, voiced by Eri Takeda.

The label was co-founded by jazz musician and former pro basketball player Ben Tankard and George King. King owned Nashville based Diadem Music Group which produced Contemporary Christian music. Diadem's signature artist Bob Carlisle is best known for his hit song \"Butterfly Kisses\". Tribute became the urban contemporary gospel (black gospel) division of Diadem and home to several gospel music stars, most notably Tankard (a keyboardist whose solo albums were instrumental releases), Yolanda Adams, Twinkie Clark of The Clark Sisters and others. Tankard was executive producer and music producer on most of the early Tribute releases and his vision was to develop artists and pioneer a new smooth genre of music he coined as \"gospeljazz\". He featured Yolanda Adam's jazzy vocals on the album and concept video single \" You Bring Out The Best In Me \" on his 1994 release \"Play Me In Your Key\". The jazzy collaborations of Tankard and Adams produced major crossover success and brought the name of Tribute Records to the forefront. Office Depot produced a gospel style \" Taking Care Of Business \" commercial national ad campaign that was centered on Tribute Records, Tankard, and Adams and ran from 1994-1996. Though the Tribute Label (Ben-Jamin' Universal Music) imprint remained with Tankard, the label contracts were later absorbed by Benson Records and later by Zomba Music Group, the gospel conglomerate Verity Records circa 1996. With all the mergers and moves that had taken place with Diadem/Tribute artists and projects, Tankard put the vision for Tribute Records on hold in 1998 and was bought out of his Vice President of A & R / Producer position with Diadem/Benson when the companies were relocated to New York City by Zomba Music Group. Tankard accepted the buy-out and put all his emphasis (and money) on his own solo career. Under a long term artist contract with Verity Records he recorded eight addition instrumental studio albums over the next decade becoming the world's bestselling gospel/jazz artist. Tankard's Verity Records contract expired with the release of his 2009 album Mercy,Mercy,Mercy which won the 2010 Stellar Award.\" Tankard's sixteenth studio album, Ben Tankard / Full Tank was released on June 5, 2012 on his revamped Tribute Records (Ben-Jamin' Universal Music & Film) label. It featured music from legendary producer-songwriters, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and special guest appearances by Mark Kibble / Take 6, & Gerald Albright. The lead single from this release, \"Sunday Vibes\", featuring Tim Bowman on guitar, was released on May 20 and quickly became the No. 1 most played song on Watercolors (Sirius XM). The CD debuted its first week on the Billboard and Amazon.com top sellers charts in three categories: Jazz, Gospel and Southern Gospel, a first for Tankard in that genre.In September 2012, Ben Tankard / Full Tank was nominated by the Soul Train Music Awards for Best Contemporary Jazz Artist and the Stellar Awards for Best Urban Contemporary Performance. Tribute/Ben-Jamin' imprint label is also the home to several TV and Film projects Tankard has in development including, \" Thicker Than Water: The Tankards \", a new reality show that showcases Tankard's family life, music career, business ventures, passion for aviation, and his role as a motivational speaker with the National Basketball Association (NBA). When asked how will the reality show will look, Ben responded: \"It is a cross between Bill Cosby and Run's House, with a twist\".

Together with his chinchilla companion Skillet, Fitz begins to recover suppressed memories that he once had a wife and a child who have now vanished. This leads him to seek answers about his past and the shadowy forces that seem to be manipulating his world.

He intended for the series to lack continuity starting from the pilot, but established a serial format after starting the second episode. He had constructed an ending for the series as well as a detailed map of characters; however, the series finale concluded differently from planned.

It is relevant particularly in corporate law and constitutional law. Apparent authority refers to a situation where a reasonable third party would understand that an agent had authority to act. This means a principal is bound by the agent's actions, even if the agent had no actual authority, whether express or implied. It raises an estoppel because the third party is given an assurance, which he relies on and would be inequitable for the principal to deny the authority given. Apparent authority can legally be found, even if actual authority has not been given. There must be some act or some knowing omission on the part of the principal - if the agent alone acts to give the third party this false impression, then the principal is not bound. However, the principal will be bound if the agent so acts in the presence of the principal, and the principal stands silently and says nothing to dissuade the third party from believing that the agent has the authority to bind the principal. Apparent authority can also occur where a principal terminates the authority of an agent, but does not inform third parties of this termination. This is called lingering apparent authority. Business owners can avoid being liable by giving public notice of the termination of authority, and by contacting any individual third parties who would have had reason to know of such authority. In relation to companies, the apparent authority of directors, officers and agents of the company is normally referred to as \"ostensible authority.\" Apparent authority issues also arise in the Fourth Amendment context, concerning who has authority to consent to a search.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The personnel halting and stimulation response rifle (PHASR) is a prototype non-lethal laser dazzler developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory's Directed Energy Directorate, U.S. Department of Defense.

He was born in New York City. His early works such as Patterns in Industrial Bureaucracy can be seen as important as they worked within the existing fields of sociology but adopted the principles of a critical intellectual. This can be seen more clearly in his 1964 work, Anti-Minotaur: The Myth of Value Free Sociology, where he claimed that sociology could not be objective and that Max Weber had never intended to make such a claim. He is probably most remembered in the academy for his 1970 work The Coming Crisis of Western Sociology. This work argued that sociology must turn away from producing objective truths and understand the subjective nature of sociology and knowledge in general and how it is bound up with the context of the times. This book was used by many schools of sociology as analysis of their own theory and methods. Gouldner, however, was not the first sociologist to be critical of objective knowledge of society; see, for example, Adorno's Negative Dialectics. Subsequently, much of Gouldner's work was concerned with critiquing modern sociology and the nature of the intellectual. He argued that ideology often produced false premises and was used as a tool by a ruling elite and that, therefore, critical subjective thought is much more important than objective thought. Gouldner achieved public prominence when he was accused of beating and kicking Laud Humphreys, then a graduate student at Washington University, who Gouldner suspected of hanging a satirical cartoon poster criticizing Gouldner on the sociology department bulletin board.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"All the Young Men is a 1960 Korean War feature film starring Alan Ladd and Sidney Poitier dealing with desegregation in the United States Marine Corps.

He was a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 2015 to 2017, representing the electorate of Cook. He was elected as a Labor candidate at the 2015 election before becoming an independent two months later. He retired at the 2017 election. Gordon was one of the first indigenous members in a generation. Gordon first entered politics as the Labor candidate in the federal seat of Leichhardt for the 2013 election, losing to Liberal National incumbent Warren Entsch. However, he increased his profile enough that he was able to successfully stand in the state seat of Cook, essentially the far northern portion of the federal seat. In 2015, tip offs to the media led to Gordon publicly disclosing a criminal history dating back to the 1980s that he had not disclosed to his colleagues including driving offences, break and entering offences, breach of bail and probation, and an apprehended violence order taken out by his mother. Gordon’s former de facto partner has accused him of domestic violence and routinely not filing tax returns to avoid child support payments to his five children. In response Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk expelled Gordon from the Labor caucus, and asked the state party's organisational wing to have Gordon expelled from the party altogether. Although Palaszczuk was well aware that the loss of Cook could potentially have put her premiership in jeopardy, she said that given the circumstances, she had no other choice. In September 2015, Queensland Police dropped the domestic violence charges against Gordon, citing insufficient evidence to prosecute. On the same day, police charged a woman with extortion for allegedly attempting to blackmail Gordon by claiming he had sent her an explicit image by SMS. Gordon was charged with drink driving and unlicensed driving on 1 June 2016 while pulled over at a random traffic stop on the Kennedy Highway at Kuranda, on the Atherton Tableland west of Cairns. He was taken to the Kuranda police station and allegedly returned a blood-alcohol content reading of 0.094. On 1 July 2016 Gordon pled guilty to both charges in the Brisbane Magistrates Court. He was fined $750 and disqualified from driving for 4 months. Gordon retired from politics at the 2017 election, having confirmed that he would not recontest his seat on 31 October 2017 following the calling of the election.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Penckbreen is a glacier in Wedel Jarlsberg Land at Spitsbergen, Svalbard.

This algorithm has an exponential search time to find the optimal next move, so general methods for speeding it up are very useful. Alpha-beta pruning works best when the best moves are considered first. This is because the best moves are the ones most likely to produce a cutoff, a condition where the game playing program knows that the position it is considering could not possibly have resulted from best play by both sides and so need not be considered further. I.e. the game playing program will always make its best available move for each position. It only needs to consider the other player's possible responses to that best move, and can skip evaluation of responses to (worse) moves it will not make. The killer heuristic attempts to produce a cutoff by assuming that a move that produced a cutoff in another branch of the game tree at the same depth is likely to produce a cutoff in the present position, that is to say that a move that was a very good move from a different (but possibly similar) position might also be a good move in the present position. By trying the killer move before other moves, a game playing program can often produce an early cutoff, saving itself the effort of considering or even generating all legal moves from a position. In practical implementation, game playing programs frequently keep track of two killer moves for each depth of the game tree (greater than depth of 1) and see if either of these moves, if legal, produces a cutoff before the program generates and considers the rest of the possible moves. If a non-killer move produces a cutoff, it replaces one of the two killer moves at its depth. This idea can be generalized into a set of refutation tables. A generalization of the killer heuristic is the history heuristic. The history heuristic can be implemented as a table that is indexed by some characteristic of the move, for example \"from\" and \"to\" squares or piece moving and the \"to\" square. When there is a cutoff, the appropriate entry in the table is incremented, such as by adding d² or 2 d  where d is the current search depth. This information is used when ordering moves.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The following is a list of the episodes of the BBC television series Maid Marian and her Merry Men.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"TSS-TV Co., Ltd.

For example, two products may both be amoxicillin, but one is in 500 mg capsules and another is in 250 mg chewable tablets. The term unit dose can also sometimes encompass non-reusable packaging as well (especially when each drug product is individually packaged ), although the FDA distinguishes that by unit-dose \"packaging\" or \"dispensing\". Depending on the context, multi(ple) unit dose can refer to distinct drug products packaged together, or to a single drug product containing multiple drugs and/or doses. The term dosage form can also sometimes refer only to the pharmaceutical formulation of a drug product's constituent drug substance(s) and any blends involved, without considering matters beyond that (like how it is ultimately configured as a consumable product such as a capsule, patch, etc.). Because of the somewhat vague boundaries and unclear overlap of these terms and certain variants and qualifiers within the pharmaceutical industry, caution is often advisable when conversing with someone who may be unfamiliar with another person's use of the term. Depending on the method/route of administration, dosage forms come in several types. These include many kinds of liquid, solid, and semisolid dosage forms. Common dosage forms include pill, tablet, or capsule, drink or syrup, and natural or herbal form such as plant or food of sorts, among many others. Notably, the route of administration (ROA) for drug delivery is dependent on the dosage form of the substance in question. A liquid dosage form is the liquid form of a dose of a chemical compound used as a drug or medication intended for administration or consumption. Various dosage forms may exist for a single particular drug, since different medical conditions can warrant different routes of administration. For example, persistent nausea, especially with vomiting, may make it difficult to use an oral dosage form, and in such a case, it may be necessary to use an alternative route such as inhalational, buccal, sublingual, nasal, suppository or parenteral instead. Additionally, a specific dosage form may be a requirement for certain kinds of drugs, as there may be issues with various factors like chemical stability or pharmacokinetics. As an example, insulin cannot be given orally because upon being administered in this manner, it is extensively metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) before reaching the blood stream, and is thereby incapable of sufficiently reaching its therapeutic target destinations. The oral and intravenous doses of a drug such as paracetamol will differ for the same reason.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Walter Fritzsch (21 November 1920 – 15 October 1997) was a German football player and manager.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Berlin Regional Airport is an airport located in Milan,  north of the central business district (CBD) of Berlin, a city in Coos County, New Hampshire, United States.

At the time Dorino was absent from Ainos, wintering on Samothrace. Without their master, the inhabitants of Ainos negotiated their surrender to the Sultan. After accepting the surrender of Ainos, Mehmed II then sent Yunus Pasha to seize Samothrace and Imbros; the admiral appointed the historian Kritobulos governor of Imros.
