It focuses around utilizing the region's multitude of \"slides,\" which are areas where the soil and growth have been washed away in a landslide, leaving a strip of bedrock; these slides have a wide variation in type, which could last as short as a few hundred feet to over a mile long, and as gradual as the hiking trails in the area to the point where they can accurately be described as cliffs. The activity gained much of its popularity after Hurricane Irene in 2011, where the downpour in the High Peaks region caused many slides to expand and appear. However, utilizing slides as means of climbing mountains likely goes back as far as the exploration and mapping of the area in the mid to late 1800s. In addition to the sport of simply climbing the slides, others utilize them as a unique way to summit the peak (despite the rough they may require to get on or off the slide), or for the purpose of backcountry skiing towards middle to late winter when the snow has accumulated. Despite its popularity among the group of dedicated hiking community, it is inherently dangerous. A slip of fall could leave you dead, or injured or wounded hours away from help. As such, many climbers choose to learn on easier slides first, such as the Bennie's Brook Slide on Lower Wolfjaw, and then work their way up to more difficult and demanding slides. They typically require the use of rock shoes at the least, with helmets, harnesses, ropes and belay devices also being necessary, also with crampons or skis/snowshoes in the winter with ice protection as well, on the more difficult slides, such as the East Face Slide on Mount Marcy.

Whoever he was, the power behind his rebellion was Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (\"Warwick the Kingmaker\"). During April 1469, the rebellion was raised in the north of England. The rebels were defeated in April by John Neville, Earl of Northumberland, but further troops were raised and the rebels openly denounced the government of Edward IV, demanding that he remove his wife's family, the Woodvilles, from positions of power. On 26 July, the rebel army met and defeated Edward's army (commanded by William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke) at the Battle of Edgecote Moor. Although they were victorious, Robin himself was reported to have died in the battle, hence his identification with William Conyers who was killed at Edgecote.

These instruments may be known as arched harps. These are instruments in which one or more strings produce sound by vibrating, and where the string carrier and resonator are physically united, with strings at right angles to the sound table, no pillar and a neck that curves away from the resonator. The arched harp is probably an evolution of the musical bow, distinguished by the addition of strings and the fusion of the string holder and the soundbox. Arched harps are found in Southeast Asia, East Africa, and elsewhere, and are historically strongly associated with Ancient Egypt and India. Two categories of arched harps exist, though are not distinguished in the Hornbostel-Sachs system: those in which only one stick constitutes both the neck and the string holder of the instrument and those in which two separate sticks are used. The oldest harps of Egypt used the one stick construction, but this later changed to two sticks, which is now also used in the Burmese saung gauk and many other forms. The arched harp saung gauk is seen as a national instrument of Myanmar, and its history there dates back centuries. In the music of India, arched harps are strongly associated with Buddhism, and are frequently depicted in images of Buddhist deities and were formerly played in the royal courts of Buddhist dynasties. The arched harp receded in prominence in India after the rise of Hinduism in that country, and the instrument's modern presence in India is apparently limited to the Pardhan people of Madhya Pradesh. The arched harps of Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa and Myanmar share a few features, including a stick to which each string is attached at one end and a piece of skin with a cavity underneath it, attached to the stick. However, it can not be conclusively determined that these instruments are related to each other. The similarities between the arched harps of Southeast Asia and East Africa are part of a broad group of cultural relations, and the distribution of arched harps in Africa follows roughly the route by which the yam apparently spread across the continent after being introduced from Indonesia. The Egyptian shoulder harp is also the earliest known instrument to have soundholes. These instruments may be classified with a suffix, based on how the strings are caused to vibrate.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Tremayne Sy Kirkland (born January 26, 1984) is a former gridiron football wide receiver.

The play involves forcing that hand to ruff, only to be overruffed. A similar motive is met in coup en passant, where indirect finesse is used instead of direct. In the end position below, spades are trump. The king of spades is onside, but declarer (South) cannot finesse against it because dummy has no trumps remaining. Declarer takes all three tricks by playing a heart first. When a club is led from dummy, East has nothing but spades remaining and therefore must ruff, and South can overruff with the ace or queen according to which spade East plays. A trump coup is not possible in a double-finesse position, since declarer with a holding like A-Q-10 over defender's K-J-x would take the first trump trick and then would have to give the defender a free finesse. In effect, a trump coup against a king (or rather, the second-highest remaining trump) must find it guarded by exactly one other trump. (If East held another card instead of the small trump, say a diamond, North-South could still play the hand as just described, but the trump coup would be unnecessary as South could just drop the king of spades instead.) Similarly, with A-K-J of trumps in hand, a trump coup against Q-x-x on the right is possible, and so on.To execute a trump coup, declarer must have exactly the same number of trumps as the defender. If declarer had more trumps, entry could not be given to dummy at the critical point when the defender will have only trumps remaining. Sometimes a declarer with too many trumps, but needing to do a trump coup, can set up the desired position by entering dummy and leading a suit he can ruff, to shorten his own trumps.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"John Melvin \"Deep\" Friesz (pronounced \"Freeze\") (born May 19, 1967) is a former professional football player, a quarterback in the National Football League for four teams.

Strategic design is about applying some of the principles of traditional design to \"big picture\" systemic challenges like business growth, health care, education, and climate change. It redefines how problems are approached, identifies opportunities for action, and helps deliver more complete and resilient solutions.\" Its foundations lie in the analysis of external and internal trends and data, which enables design decisions to be made on the basis of facts rather than aesthetics or intuition. As such it is regarded as an effective way to bridge innovation, research, management and design. The discipline is mostly practiced by design agencies or by internal development departments. Businesses are the main consumers of strategic design, but the public, political and not-for-profit sectors are also making increasing use of the discipline. Its applications are varied, yet often aim to strengthen one of the following: product branding, product development, corporate identity, corporate branding, operating and business models, and service delivery. Strategic design has become increasingly crucial in recent years, as businesses and organisations compete for a share of today’s global and fast-paced marketplace. “To survive in today’s rapidly changing world, products and services must not only anticipate change, but drive it. Businesses that don’t will lose market share to those that do. There have been many examples of strategic design breakthroughs over the years and in an increasingly competitive global market with rapid product cycles, strategic design is becoming more important.”","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Antonio Soda (born 24 June 1964 in Cutro) is an Italian football manager currently of Recanatese and former striker.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Uilke Piebe (\"Oeki\") Hoekema (born 28 January 1949 in Leeuwarden) is a retired Dutch football player who played for Go Ahead Eagles, PSV, De Graafschap, Lierse SK, ADO Den Haag and FC Wageningen, as well as the Dutch national side.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":" Katukukke  is a village in Kasaragod district in the state of Kerala, India.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The 1978 Missouri Tigers football team represented the University of Missouri during the 1978 NCAA Division I-A football season as a member of the Big Eight Conference (Big 8).

His appointment to the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs by President Manuel Ávila Camacho marked an end to the Post-Revolutionary domination of politicians from the North of the country. With his co-cabinet member Miguel Alemán Valdés (Secretary of the Interior), he \"gave Mexico the most progressive foreign policy and the most orderly internal government in the nation's history.\" By 1941, he had successfully settled all foreign claims against the government stemming from the Cárdenas-era expropriations. He negotioated a favorable economic treaty, fixed the peso to the United States dollar, and secured loans for industrial development from the Export-Import Bank of the United States. During World War II, he was a strong proponent of inter-American unity and led conferences of the foreign ministers of countries of the Americas to this end. He was criticized by some for being too pro-American. He emerged alongside Alemán as a prime contender for the presidency in 1946. He was better-known abroad than his rival, and was considered to have stronger tendencies toward democracy. However, his association with the United States made him unpopular in the left wing of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and Alemán won the party's nomination.

It often differentiates financial instruments that are easily tradable (or tradeable) as opposed to those that require the permission of the company or a signed document that registers the transfer of securities between two market participants. Another way to look at it is the difference between how a person buys a fund (collective investment scheme) and how they buy a bond or share. Liquid Tradable Securities come in many forms and with a wide variety of acronyms. These include stocks and bonds as well as exchange-traded funds, exchange traded commodities, exchange-traded notes (including certificates), REITs, as well as most OTC securities. Note that these do not include Swaps or repurchase agreement (repos), which are contractual arrangements and as such are not tradable. This is a wider definition than the definition of transferable securities under MiFID LTS advantage over collective investment scheme LTS' offer a significant advantage over collective investment schemes. Collective investment schemes (or CIS or UCIS) come in many legal forms. What is common in each legal form is the existence of a shareholder register; according to the laws of most jurisdictions, an entry in the shareholder register must be accompanied by a signed declaration to invest. Equally, a transfer of shares in a collective investment scheme is usually not allowed without the signed consent of the company. These procedural requirements limit the ability of shareholders to trade their shares. A small subset of collective investment schemes are electronically tradable through stock exchanges (most notably REITs). However, the vast majority of collective investment schemes require these procedural steps. LTS' on the other hand have no such limitations. They are most commonly represented by dematerialised certificates or immobilisation conditions (according to US IRS definitions). LTS' are held in a global note form and deposited with a central securities depository (CSD). The simplifies the administrative procedures of buying and selling and reduces both the costs of administration for the company and the cost of compliance. The benefit for investors is the ease of trading. Positions can be sold without consent of the company and it is perfectly feasible for active secondary market sales to take place unbeknownst to the company. Many exchanges provide a list of tradable instruments (either in the form of a requirements for listing or as a searchable function). LTSs simply the compliance requirements of fiduciary trustees and financial advisers as they usually include a standard set of documents (including the form of the global note), an information memorandum or prospectus, and a term sheet. The approval of the CSD is critical to this process; all instruments are verified before the issue of an ISIN number and the creation of the dematerialised security is handled by the CSD. The criteria for acceptance are quite strict. IRS regulations stipulate particular requirements for tradable securities. These generally describe the characteristics necessary for an LTS (according to IRS definitions, at least).","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Bhutan women's national football team represents Bhutan in international women's football.

It is characterized by digital technologies combined with high levels of cognitive and cultural labor. The concept has been associated with 'post-Fordism', the 'knowledge economy', the 'new economy' and highly flexible labor markets. As Fordist mass production began to wane after the mid to late 1970s in advanced capitalist countries, a more flexible system of productive activity began to take its place. The concept of cognitive-cultural capitalism has developed as a response to the insufficiency of the interpretations of this transition from a Fordist to a post-Fordist model of \"flexible accumulation. Early empirical studies of this new system were published in the 1980s on the basis of case-study materials focused mainly on high-technology industrial districts in the United States (Silicon Valley, Orange County, Boston's Route 128, etc.—see Saxenian) and revived craft industries in the north-east and center of Italy (the so-called Third Italy ). Over the following decades, considerable empirical and theoretical advances were made on the basis of studies of the new cultural economy (fashion, film, electronic games, publishing, etc.).Levy and Murnane in The New Division of Labor highlight the replacement of standardized machinery in the American production system by digital technologies that not only act as a substitute for routine labor, but that also complement and enhance the intellectual and affective assets of the labor force.

Its area was roughly equivalent to that of the modern state of Mongolia, which is sometimes called \"North Mongolia\" in China today, plus the Russian republic of Tuva. While the administrative North Mongolia only consisted of the four Khalkha aimags (Setsen Khan Aimag, Tüsheet Khan Aimag, Sain Noyon Khan Aimag and Zasagt Khan Aimag), in the late Qing period \"North Mongolia\" was also used to refer to Khalkha plus Oirat areas Khovd and the directly-ruled Tannu Uriankhai ().The name \"North Mongolia\" is contrasted with South Mongolia, which corresponds to the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia in China. South Mongolia was given its name because it was more directly administered by the Qing court; North Mongolia (which is further from the capital Beijing) had a greater degree of autonomy within the Qing domain. The term ar mongol (or , lit. \"Mongolia located in the north (of the Gobi)\") is sometimes used in Mongolian (or Chinese) language to refer to North Mongolia when making a distinction with South Mongolia, so as to elide the history of Qing rule and rather imply a geographic unity or distinction of regions inhabited by Mongols in the Mongolian Plateau. There also exists an English term Northern Mongolia, but possibly with political connotations. It can also be used to refer to Mongolia synchronically. In the Mongolian language, the word ar refers to the back side of something, which has been extended to mean the northern side of any spatial entity, e.g. a mountain or a yurt. The word öbür refers to the south (and thus protected) side of a mountain. So the difference between South Mongolia and the Mongolian state is conceived of in the metaphor as at the backward northern side vs. the south side of a mountain. In contrast to  (), there is also  () roughly referring to the region now known as South Mongolia.Today, \"North Mongolia\" is sometimes still informally used to refer to Mongolia. Outer Mongolia is also used quite commonly in the Republic of China (Taiwan). To avoid confusion between the sovereign nation of Mongolia and China's Inner Mongolia, but to recognize the sovereignty of Mongolia, media in China generally refer to the former as \"State of Mongolia\" (, that is the translation of the official name in Mongolian, /) instead of just \"Mongolia\" (), that could refer to the whole Mongolia area.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"François Ponsard (1 June 1814 &ndash; 7 July 1867), was a French dramatist, poet and author and was a member of the Académie française.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Ariranha is a municipality in the state of São Paulo, Brazil.

As the two villages are 9 km (over 5 miles) from each other and there was traditionally poor communication in the snowy months of the year, these villages' dialects diverged and are still markedly different both from each other and from the language spoken further down the mountains (Friulian). According to studies by some institutions (examples to follow) which study Ladin languages these two dialects moved away from Friulian to become 'Raetic-Dolomitic-Ladin' similar to Ladin languages spoken in Grijun Switzerland, while keeping Friulian characteristics.

Although an experimental 64 km (40 mile) microwave telecommunication link across the English Channel was demonstrated in 1931, the development of radar in World War II provided the technology for practical exploitation of microwave communication. In the 1950s, large transcontinental microwave relay networks, consisting of chains of repeater stations linked by line-of-sight beams of microwaves were built in Europe and America to relay long distance telephone traffic and television programs between cities. Communication satellites which transferred data between ground stations by microwaves took over much long distance traffic in the 1960s. In recent years, there has been an explosive increase in use of the microwave spectrum by new telecommunication technologies such as wireless networks, and direct-broadcast satellites which broadcast television and radio directly into consumers' homes.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Panemunė Castle is a castle on the right bank of the Nemunas river, in Vytėnai, Jurbarkas district, Lithuania. The initial hill fort of the Teutonic Knights (erected 1343) was replaced by a castle built in 1604-1610 by a noble Hungarian descent Janusz Eperjesz. The name “Panemunė“ („along the Nemunas“, pronounced Pa ne mu‘ ne), it is guessed, arose from the former Panemunė Manor that was once here. Panemunė Castle was not designed to be a stronghold for the defence of the land but a typical, for the beginning of the 17th mentury, nobleman castle with defensive fittings, residential buildings, and farm buildings. Panemunė Castle became one of the most beautiful Renaissance era building in Lithuania. The castle was reconstructed around 1759 by Giełgud family.

The story begins in medias res: the eponymous Lucy has come from the West Indies to the United States to be an au pair for a wealthy white family. The plot of the novel closely mirrors Kincaid's own experiences. Lucy retains the critical tone of A Small Place but simplifies the style of Kincaid’s earlier work by using less repetition and surrealism. The first of her books set completely outside the Caribbean, Lucy, like most of Kincaid’s writing, has a strong autobiographical basis. The novel’s protagonist, Lucy Josephine Potter, shares one of Kincaid’s given names and her birthday. Like Kincaid, Lucy leaves the Caribbean to become an au pair in a large American city. At nineteen, Lucy is older than previous Kincaid protagonists, which lends the book a more mature and cynical perspective than in her previous fiction. Still, Lucy has pangs of homesickness and unresolved feelings about her mother, and she has never lived on her own or seen much of the world. With plenty of room for growth and Lucy becoming a photographer, the story takes the form of a künstlerroman, a novel in which an artist matures. Lucy also joins the tradition of American immigration literature, tales that recount a newcomer’s experience in the United States, such as those seen in Anzia Yezierska’s Bread Givers, Willa Cather’s My Antonia, and Julia Alvarez’s How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents. Along with exploring immigration, Lucy, as does much of Kincaid’s work, grapples with tensions between mother and daughter. Colonial themes of identity confusion and the connection between maternal and imperial rule stand out less clearly in Lucy than in Kincaid’s earlier books but have an underlying presence in Lucy’s relationship with her white, affluent employers, her homeland, and her new surroundings.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Maryland Route 363 (MD 363) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.

The meanings of \"state\" and \"very small\" are not well-defined in international law. Recent attempts, since 2010, to define microstates have focused on identifying political entities with unique qualitative features linked to their geographic or demographic limitations. According to a qualitative definition, microstates are: \"modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints.\" In line with this and most other definitions, examples of microstates include: Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, Andorra, the Cook Islands, Niue and the Federated States of Micronesia. The smallest political unit recognized as a sovereign state is Vatican City, with 842 citizens as of July 2013 and an area of only 44 ha.

An example of a ⊕P problem is \"does a given graph have an odd number of perfect matchings?\" The class was defined by Papadimitriou and Zachos in 1983. ⊕P is a counting class, and can be seen as finding the least significant bit of the answer to the corresponding #P problem. The problem of finding the most significant bit is in PP. PP is believed to be a considerably harder class than ⊕P; for example, there is a relativized universe (see oracle machine) where P = ⊕P ≠ NP = PP = EXPTIME, as shown by Beigel, Buhrman, and Fortnow in 1998. While Toda's theorem shows that P PP contains PH, P ⊕P is not known to even contain NP. However, the first part of the proof of Toda's theorem shows that BPP ⊕P contains PH. Lance Fortnow has written a concise proof of this theorem. ⊕P contains the graph isomorphism problem, and in fact this problem is low for ⊕P. It also trivially contains UP, since all problems in UP have either zero or one accepting paths. More generally, ⊕P is low for itself, meaning that such a machine gains no power from being able to solve any ⊕P problem instantly. The ⊕ symbol in the name of the class may be a reference to use of the symbol ⊕ in Boolean algebra to refer the exclusive disjunction operator. This makes sense because if we consider \"accepts\" to be 1 and \"not accepts\" to be 0, the result of the machine is the exclusive disjunction of the results of each computation path.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Så ska det låta is a Swedish game show, based on the Irish The Lyrics Board.

But these plans were thwarted by Sigismund's fondness for art. The mother, without her husband's knowledge, had him instructed in drawing in the local academy. Having lost his father in early youth, Frank was apprenticed to his godfather Neubert, who carried on at Nuremberg the business of lacquering and decorating wooden boxes and caskets. His progress in this work was rapid, but he stayed less than a year with Neubert. After returning to the house of his mother, who had married a second time, he once more devoted himself to the study of drawing, meantime painting boxes for other manufacturers at Nuremberg and earning enough to pay his expenses. On completing his twenty-first year his parents induced him against his inclination to wed Marie H. Blechkoll, the daughter of an hotel-keeper who brought him as her dowry the inn Zur Himmelsleiter. He continued his art studies while his wife managed the hotel. However, he now turned his attention to painting porcelain, to which art one of his guests, the porcelain-painter Trost, had introduced him. His success was immediate, and when, after a married life of five years, his wife died, he sold the hotel and established a porcelain factory.

Kaufman grew up in Los Angeles, lived for six years in St. Louis, and moved back to San Francisco in the summer of 2007. In January 2011, King left Salon. In addition to covering the major American sports leagues and international events such as the Olympics and the World Cup, Kaufman's columns often deal with issues related to the state of American sports. Some specific concerns of Kaufman include the role of race in sports and American culture, publicly financed stadiums, performance-enhancing substances, the inequalities and hypocrisy in the NCAA, and the poor quality of television sports announcing. His articles feature light-hearted humor, typically with a degree of self-deprecation. A former Angeleno, he enjoys relating stories of his fond memories of the Dodger games he listened to as a child. Annually, he tracks the performance of NFL prognosticators, himself included, along with his son Buster, the \"coin-flippinest 4-year-old in North America\", who flips coins to randomly predict the outcome of (presumably) closely contested games. Kaufman has proposed changing the rules of nearly every organized sport, including removal of field goals from American football, the elimination of free throws from basketball, and the abolishment of offsides from soccer. Kaufman is a frequent critic of sports announcers who use shoddy statistics or generally do not care about the sport which they are announcing. He has particular distaste for coverage of Major League Baseball on the Fox Network, including the playoffs, World Series and All-Star Game. Kaufman, an admirer of sabermetrician Bill James, made his own contribution to baseball statistics by creating the Neifi Index . Named for infielder Neifi Pérez, this statistic measures a player's ability to contribute to his team's success by not playing. Introduced as an award that \"we, the great whiffing, grounder-booting, sedentary lifestyle-leading masses, wouldn't just have a chance of winning if we were allowed to play. We'd be a lock\", the Neifi Index is the difference between a player's team's winning percentage when he does not play and when he does play. It is called the Neifi Index because when Kaufman first computed it, the San Francisco Giants winning percentage when Pérez did not play was .929, but was only .542 when he did play, thus giving Neifi an index of .387. Under the stage name the King Teen, Kaufman was the singer for the Smokejumpers, \"purveyors of hampster-slappin' punk rockabilly in San Francisco from 1996-2000.\"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Eternally Yours is the second album released by the Australian music group The Saints in 1978.

She was buried in mastaba D 14 at Saqqara.The Austrian Egyptologist Wilfried Seipel has suggested that was the queen of pharaoh Menkauhor Kaiu. Based on the datation of the tombs surrounding Khuit's burial, Seipel argues that she lived during the mid-Fifth Dynasty. Proceeding by elimination, Seipel attributed known queens to each king of the period, which only leaves Menkauhor as a candidate king for her. These arguments are criticized by the French Egyptologist Michel Baud, who observes that pharaohs could have had more than one queen. Another queen by the name of Meresankh IV is more commonly suggested as the wife of Menkauhor Kaiu and thus may have been a contemporary of Khuit. Khuit held the titles Great one of the hetes-sceptre (wrt-hetes), She who sees Horus and Seth (m33t-hrw-stsh), Great of Praises, King’s Wife, his beloved, Attendant of the Great One, King’s Daughter, and King’s Wife.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Klaus Perwas (born 8 March 1971) is a German former basketball player and current assistant coach of the German professional club Skyliners Frankfurt.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Sèmèrè II is an arrondissement in the Donga department of Benin.

In 90 minutes he covers all 4 operas consisting of Wagner's Ring Cycle with scenes taken from his productions of the operas. Included in the programme are interviews with opera singers, notably John Tomlinson who has sung the principal character Wotan numerous times. Under Pappano he has sung the Götterdämmerung antagonist, Hagen. Pappano visits Bayreuth and the palace of Wagner's patron Ludwig II of Bavaria during the documentary. Pappano explains how Wagner did not approve of the word opera to describe his compositions. Instead he favoured the term musical drama, which he considered to be an all inclusive term for his role of controlling every aspect of the production. Pappano relates how Wagner would stand on the stage, directing the singers, including singing all the roles, male and female to them; as means to direct them in interpreting roles. Wagner would also show stage choreography to the cast by performing stage fighting and demonstrating how to climb mountains. When scenes required some skill in mountaineering to scale scenography of a mountain. Also noteworthy within the programme is Pappano filming the interior of Ludwig II's palace revealing the neo-gothic and richly coloured interior design alongside panoramic paintings of scenes from Wagner's Ring Cycle. The palace of Richard Wagner's patron is usually ignored in documentaries in favour if focusing exclusively on the Bayreuth opera house. Pappano returned to conducting the Ring for the Royal Opera House, London in October 2012.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Siah Marz () may refer to:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"E. flavescens may refer to:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Austin Ellsworth Cofrin (October 10, 1883 – May 27, 1980) was an American industrialist that founded the Fort Howard Paper Company in Green Bay, Wisconsin.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Shamu Express is a steel roller coaster at SeaWorld Orlando and SeaWorld San Antonio in the Shamu's Happy Harbor section of the park, a kid-oriented section.
