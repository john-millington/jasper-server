The term 'Wright' comes from the circa 700 AD Old English word 'wryhta' or 'wyrhta', meaning worker or shaper of wood. Later it became any occupational worker (for example, a shipwright is a person who builds ships), and is used as a British family name. Wright is the sixteenth most common surname in England. Its use as an occupational title continued until the mid-19th century. This use was often combined with other words such as in shipwright, wheelwright, wainwright and playwright. The word carpentier, now \"carpenter\", was introduced into England in the years after the Norman conquest in 1066 and slowly replaced the traditional name and meaning of wright in most of England. 'Wright' is still used in Scottish English in the original meaning of 'skilled woodworker'. The Incorporation of Wrights of the Trades House of Glasgow, and the Incorporation of Wrights and Masons of Edinburgh Trades retain the word in its original meaning in their role of promoting the woodworking trade. Wright is also an anglicised version of the Scots Gaelic clan name \"MacIntyre\" or \"Mac an t-Saoir\", meaning \"son of the wright\" (son of the carpenter).

There are a few species which have secondarily lost the ability to reproduce sexually, such as Bdelloidea, and some plants and animals that routinely reproduce asexually (by apomixis and parthenogenesis) without entirely losing sex. The evolution of sex contains two related, yet distinct, themes: its origin and its maintenance. The maintenance of sexual reproduction in a highly competitive world has long been one of the major mysteries of biology given that asexual reproduction can reproduce much more quickly because 50% of offspring from sexual reproduction are males, unable to produce offspring themselves. Since hypotheses for the origins of sex are difficult to test experimentally (outside of evolutionary computation), most current work has focused on the maintenance of sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction must offer significant fitness advantages to a species because despite the two-fold cost of sex, it dominates among multicellular forms of life, implying that the fitness of offspring produced outweighs the costs. Sexual reproduction derives from recombination, where parent genotypes are reorganized and shared with the offspring. This stands in contrast to single-parent asexual replication, where the offspring is identical to the parents. Recombination supplies two fault-tolerance mechanisms at the molecular level: recombinational DNA repair (promoted during meiosis because homologous chromosomes pair at that time) and complementation (also known as heterosis, hybrid vigor or masking of mutations).","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Bahir or Sefer HaBahir (; Hebrew: סֵפֶר הַבָּהִיר, \"Book of the Bright\") is an anonymous mystical work, attributed to a 1st-century rabbinic sage Nehunya ben HaKanah (a contemporary of Yochanan ben Zakai) because it begins with the words, \"R.

As the fad began to decline, over 240 million Wacky WallWalkers had been sold, raking in about 80 million dollars. The popular toy was featured in the 1983 animated Christmas special Deck the Halls with Wacky Walls, starring the voices of Daws Butler, Tress MacNeille, and Marvin Kaplan.

One character in the special was modeled after Hakuta's son, Kenzo. The Wacky WallWalker was referenced in The Simpsons \"Treehouse of Horror XXII\"'s Avatar parody when the female alien hit a tree and \"walked\" down it in the manner of the Wacky WallWalker. The Wacky WallWalker was similarly referenced in an episode of Family Guy, when Peter Griffin draws faces on an octopus tank, only to have the glass break, and is subsequently saved by Seamus Levine who throws the octopus on the wall.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Devin Green (born October 25, 1982) is an American professional basketball player who last played for Atlético Echagüe of the Liga Nacional de Básquet.

Tulchulcha lived in the underworld known as Aita. Many scholars refer to this deity as male because of masculine features, such as animalistic facial hair that may resemble a beard. However, according to Nancy de Grummond, \"This monster is often referred to as male but in fact is very likely female (or neither gender), for she wears a woman’s dress, has decidedly pale pinkish skin (compare the standard brick-red male flesh of These), and even appears to have breasts.\" She also identifies the diamond-marking of Tuchulcha's serpents as identifying the poisonous adder (Vipera berus berus). Emeline Hill Richardson and Graeme Barker and Tom Rasmussen also state that Tuchulcha is female. However, Tuchulcha's garment is known to classical historians as a chiton and is worn by both men and women. As well, the same clothing is worn by another male deity, Charun. The only known rendering of Tuchulcha is identified in a wall painting in the Tomb of Orcus II, in Tarquinia, Italy. There the deity appears in a depiction of the story of These (Greek Theseus) visiting the underworld. These and his friend Peirithous (only his head visible in the surviving portion of the image) are playing a board game, attended by Tuchulcha.

In the future the label will release some of these albums in vinyl format with thought being put into artwork and other extras in order to make the album special. The long-term intent of Misantrof is to be a place where all art forms come together, and create a massive display, each piece enhancing the other, a place where creative people are free to express themselves is any art form free from any notion of commercialisation. Misantrof is currently run by a board consisting of musicians and music fans. Other musicians which have joined Vrangsinn on the board are Pål Robert Sæther(chairman), Øystein Ariansen(artist relations).

Links are activated through spoken commands. The idea of surfing the web by voice dates back to at least the work of Hemphill and Thrift in 1995 who developed a system in which, HTML pages were downloaded and processed on client-side computers enabling voice access to web page content, and activation of hyperlinks through spoken commands. Also in the mid 90’s, researchers at AT&T were discussing the development of a new markup language that would enable the web to be accessed through regular phones. From 1995 to 1999, AT&T, Lucent, Motorola, and IBM all developed their own versions of phone and speech markup languages. These companies created the VoiceXML Forum, and jointly designed the Voice Markup Language, VXML, which was accepted by the W3C Committee in 2000. VXML is typically used to create hyperlinked speech applications. VXML pages include commands for prompting user speech input, invoking recognition grammars, outputting synthesized voice, iterating through blocks of code, calling local JavaScript, and hyperlinking to other remote VXML pages downloaded in a manner similar to the linking of HTML pages in the conventional Web. Around the same time as the emergence of VXML, a research group at the University of Windsor in Canada were developing an alternative approach, in which speech applications  deployed on the web can be accessed by client-side speech browsers which provide the speech-recognition capability, that is tailored to the application by downloading an application-specific recognition grammar from the remote speech application web site. Input that is recognized by the client-side browser is sent to the remote server which processes it and returns a text result  to the browsers for output as synthesized voice. The term SpeechWeb was used, in 1999, to describe the collection of hyperlinked speech applications in this architecture . The first SpeechWeb browser was demonstrated at the AAAI Sixteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence. The term \"speechweb\" has also been used, since the 90’s, in a different context to describe a web based network of  information on speech, language and speech-language pathology. In addition, it was also hoped to provide a meeting place for professionals and those who have been affected by communication disorders. The term \"speechWeb\" has been trademarked by the company PipeBeach, which is now owned by HP, and refers to a software product which bridges telephone networks and conventional web servers. In 2005, it was recognized that very few voice applications were available to the public through the Internet, despite the maturity of VXML at that time. It was also observed that nearly all VXML applications that were available had been constructed by people working in commerce and industry. This was in stark contrast to the huge growth of the conventional web, and the huge involvement of the public in the development of regular web pages, only a few years after the development of HTML. This observation led to the call for a Public-Domain SpeechWeb which is accessible to the public through existing web browsers (with speech plugins) and which contains hyperlinked speech applications that are created and deployed by the public in a manner that is analogous to the creation and deployment of HTML pages on the conventional web. A browser for the Public-Domain SpeechWeb was demonstrated at the 16th International World Wide Web Conference, held in Banff, Canada in 2007. The browser is a small X+V page which is executed by the freely available  Opera with the free IBM speech-recognition plugin.

When asked about the style of Streets of Gotham, Batman group editor Mike Marts explained, \"...these are Batman stories told through the point of view of other characters in Gotham City. So it could be Commissioner Gordon telling the story, it could be a villain, or it could be a supporting character telling the story.\" The series also includes a Manhunter co-feature written by Marc Andreyko and illustrated by Georges Jeanty. The co-feature was replaced by another co-feature that spins-off of the end of the Manhunter one starring Two-Face. The same occurs with the Two-Face one ending and starting the Ragman co-feature.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Rofeh Cholim Cancer Society (RCCS) is an American-based organization dedicated to funding insurance policies for cancer-stricken patients.

He is mentioned for the first time in 1233, when the family's lands near Treviso were confiscated after his cousin Guecellone V had been identified as the instigator of the assassins of Marino Dandolo. Biaquino was then part of a league formed against the Trevigiani together with Guecellone and his brother Tolberto II, the cities of Conegliano, Ceneda and Vicenza, the bishops of Belluno and Feltre, and the patriarch of Aquileia. In 1239, Treviso went to the Guelph Alberico da Romano thanks to his support, and Biaquino was podestà of the city from 1241 to 1243. He also took part on the Guelph side at the siege of Ferrara in 1240. At Guecellone's death, Tolberto sided for the Ghibellines of Ezzelino III da Romano, and Biaquino became one of the area's main Guelph leaders, leading the army of Treviso against Padua and defending Feltre and Belluno. Once both emperor Frederick II and Ezzelino had died (1259), Biaquino reconciled with the Ghibellines of his family: the family's lands were divided, and he received the Cadore (whose rights he had obtained from Bertold of Andrechs, patriarch of Aquileia) and some fiefs in the Ceneda county. In 1260-1270, he supported the Guelph party in the internal struggles of the commune of Treviso, opening to the road to power to his son Gherardo, whom he had from his first wife, India di Gherardo da Camposampiero.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Apartment List is a platform that connects renters with apartment listings through an online marketplace. As of January 2018, Apartment List had over 4 million units on its platform. Over 40 U.S. cities are represented on the site, with 5 million visitors per month. Apartment List uses a business model that only charges properties for listings that have been rented. Co-founders, CEO John Kobs and COO Chris Erickson, launched Apartment List in September 2011 at TechCrunch Disrupt. After having negative experiences as both renters and landlords, Kobs and Erickson wanted to create a platform that would improve the rental experience. Initially, Apartment List partnered with other online rental companies to provide a service where a user could search a number of sites simultaneously. In 2014, Apartment List decided to change to the current ‘pay-per-move-in’ model to focus the experience on the renter. Apartment List has had three series of fundraising efforts. In November 2013, Series A funding raised $23 million, with lead investor Matrix Partners. Series B funding in November 2016 raised $30 million, with lead investor Canaan Partners, and Series C funding raised $50 million with Passport Capital in November 2017. The last round of funding is being used to increase the property listings in smaller buildings and single-family homes. Apartment List’s 4 million properties can be accessed either directly through the Apartment List site or on a mobile app. In late 2017, Apartment List partnered with Facebook Marketplace, Homes.com, and Realtor.com. The service is free for renters. Larger, professionally-managed properties are charged a variable fee. By using a mixture of questions, manual filters, and photos and maps, the potential renter is provided customized search recommendations and is guided through the renting process. The listings are based on these preferences and any changes in price are updated in real time. Each listing that appears on Apartment List has been verified to ensure transparency and accuracy. Landlords and building managers are connected to serious potential renters and they only pay a fee once a renter has moved into their new home. The Apartment List Rentonomics blog publishes authoritative rent data studies for the entire United States, as well as many specific local markets.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Coore (also known as Coor) (Irish: Cubhar.

He was the great grandson of The Lord Rhys (died 1197), prince of south Wales, and the last ruler of a united Deheubarth. He is best known for his leadership of a revolt in south Wales in 1287–88. Because Deheubarth fragmented after the Lord Rhys' death in 1197, Rhys ap Maredudd's father had ruled over a truncated portion of the ancient kingdom. Rhys succeeded his father in 1271 as lord of the region of Deheubarth known as the Cantref Mawr, and considered himself custodian of Dinefwr, the royal capital of Deheubarth. He ruled the Cantref Mawr from 1271, though not under the aegis of the prince of Wales, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, as his father had, so relations between the two men appear to have been cold. He was among the first Welsh noblemen to submit to the English crown during the Anglo-Welsh war of 1276–77, on the grounds that his claims to the lands of Maenordeilo, Mallaen, Caeo and Mabelfyw, and Dinefwr Castle – all within Deheubarth and ruled by his great-grandfather – would be properly considered. The agreement has been indicative to some historians of Rhys' ambitions to reconstitute Deheubarth as a unified kingdom within the principality of Wales. He continued to exercise power in the Cantref Mawr after Llywelyn's death in 1282, and the execution of the last native prince of Wales, Dafydd ap Gruffudd, the following year. His failure, alone of all the noblemen of Deheubarth, to adhere to Llywelyn and Dafydd's cause in the war of 1282–3 led to king Edward I of England bestowing additional lands on Rhys for his allegiance to the English crown. Edward, however, refused to deliver to Rhys the long sought-after castle at Dinefwr. This state of affairs led Rhys to make Dryslwyn castle his main residence, and it seems likely that he embarked on a substantial building programme there in the late 1270s and early 1280s. Rhys endeavoured to remain loyal to the English crown in the hope he may be restored to more of his former patrimony, but no such offers were forthcoming from the king – instead, Edward forced Rhys to quitclaim the castle to him in October 1283. In 1287 he rebelled and led the capture of most of Ystrad Tywi, the heartland of Deheubarth, including the castles at Dinefwr and Carreg Cennen. Though the revolt was quelled by the autumn, it broke out again in November, and was only brought to a conclusion after a ten-day siege of Rhys' final stronghold, the castle at Newcastle Emlyn, in January 1288. After Newcastle Emlyn's fall Rhys went into hiding; one tradition has him fleeing to Ireland, but this remains unsubstantiated. He was eventually captured in 1291 and executed for treason at York in 1292. His son, also named Rhys, was arrested after his execution, and was imprisoned, firstly in Bristol Castle and then in Norwich; he was still alive in 1340. Late genealogical sources also give a daughter, Morfudd, and an individual occurring in 1289, Maredudd ap Richard [sic] ap Maredudd, may also have been his son. The next Welshman to lead a revolt against the English crown was Madog ap Llywelyn in Gwynedd.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Australian cricket team toured the West Indies in the 1972–73 season to play a five-match Test series against the West Indies.

Originally known as Saakadze (სააკაძე), they acquired, in the 1640s, the title of prince (tavadi) and the new surname, which is a composite of the two hereditary offices, mouravi and tarkhan. The family was reconfirmed as the princes (knyaz) by the Russian Empire in 1826 and 1850. The cadets continued to be called Saakadze and remained members of the untitled nobility (aznauri) until 1881 when they were also elevated to the princely rank. The earliest record of the Saakadze clan dates back to the reign of Queen Tamar. The first known member of the family, Siaush Saakadze (died c. 1606), was a loyal officer in the service of Simon I of Kartli, who gave him the office of mouravi of Tbilisi in the 1580s. His son, Giorgi Saakadze (the Grand Mouravi; c. 1570 – 1629) pursued a contradictory and turbulent career.

The cross-polarization interference canceller (known as XPIC) is a signal processing technique implemented on the demodulated received signals at the baseband level. It is typically necessary in Polarization Division Multiplexing systems: the data sources to be transmitted are coded and mapped into QAM modulating symbols at the system's symbol rate and upconverted to a carrier frequency, generating two radio streams radiated by a single dual-polarized antenna (see feed pattern of Parabolic antenna). A corresponding dual-polarized antenna is located at the remote site and connected to two receivers, which downconvert the radio streams into baseband signals (BB H, BB V).This multiplexing/demultiplexing technique is based on the expected discrimination between the two orthogonal polarizations (XPD): As a practical consequence, at the receiving site the two streams are received with a residual mutual interference. In many practical cases, especially for high-level M-QAM modulations, the communication system cannot tolerate the experienced levels of cross-polarization interference and an improved suppression is necessary. The two received polarizations at the antenna outputs, normally linear horizontal H and vertical V, are routed each to a receiver whose baseband output is further processed by an ad-hoc cross-polarization cancelling scheme, commonly implemented as a digital stage. The XPIC algorithm attains the correct reconstruction of H by summing V to H to cancel any residual interference, and vice-versa. The cancelling process is typically implemented using two blocks: a baseband equalizer and the baseband XPIC. The output from the latter is subtracted from the former and then sent to the decision stage, responsible for yielding the estimation of the data stream. The equalization and XPIC blocks are normally adaptive for a correct tracking of the time-variant channel transfer function: XPIC must provide a shaping of the received cross signal equal to the portion of the cross interference affecting the main one. The feedback control to drive the adapting criteria comes from the measure of the residual error across the decision block. In the example, both blocks are based on the typical structure of the Finite Impulse Response digital filter and whose the coefficients are not fixed, but adapted to minimize a suitable functional : result of cancelling action feeding the decision device at time instant  ; where the asterisk denotes complex-conjugation. No a-priori knowledge on the transmitted symbols is required with this basic scheme (blind or zero-knowledge). When the delay  is a fraction of the symbol period the blocks are said to be fractionally-spaced. Other minimizing functions are least mean square LMS or zero forcing ZF while the architecture can be a Decision Feedback or further improved by means of known signals (Pilot signal).","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Good Day () is a ten-member South Korean girl group formed by C9 Entertainment.

The project was originally introduced as a collection of material created by and relating to a 1970s German glam rock band, whose memorabilia were notably featured in the Beck's Futures exhibition in 2006, and which deceived Sunday Times cultural commentator Waldemar Januszczak into running an article describing their claimed activities in giving away free copies of their music to fans. Januszczak went so far as to tip the collection for the Beck's Futures prize. The exhibit was eventually runner up for the prize after Lustfaust were revealed as a fabrication, set within a combination of fictional and actual histories. Shovlin had previously gained notoriety by setting up an exhibition of art that was claimed to have been produced by a 13-year-old missing schoolgirl called Naomi V. Jelish. The work has been praised for the depth of its deception — the artists set up fake web sites about the band and added it to English Wikipedia, assembled photographs and chronologies for their tours, recorded an interview with the band's \"German-Belgian frontman\", and even recorded excerpts of music which were attributed to them. The deception was so deep that some viewers actually boasted of having seen the band live. This was in spite of deliberate clues which had been included in the exhibition, such as notes describing the band as veering \"dangerously close to Spinal Tap-isms\" and \"an obscurantist's dream\". One person who guessed at the exhibition's nature was The Times art critic Rachel Campbell-Johnston. Four days before Januszczak's piece was published, she praised the collection, but cautioned \"Don’t be surprised if the entire band is a fabrication — down to its references on internet sites.\" In 2007, Lustfaust began to perform live shows across Europe in numerous cities.

The 2-1/2 story wood frame house was built in 1720 by Nathaniel Thayer and was subsequently expanded in the 1760s and again in the 19th century. General Sylvanus Thayer, known as the \"father of West Point,\" was born in the house in 1785 and resided there until 1793. In 1958, the parcel of land on which the house sat was purchased by the Walworth Steel Company; rather than tearing the old house down, it was dismantled and moved approximately one mile down Washington Street to its present location. Roughly 60% of the timbers in the house are original, while the others have been replaced during restoration with materials appropriate to the late 18th century. The house is furnished to represent a middle-class agricultural household, like the Thayer family, in 1785-1793. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.
