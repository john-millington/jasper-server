Apart from growing up in Brooklyn, New York, little else is known about his early life. In the early 1910s he began working for the New York World, first at the art department before becoming the paper's \"crossword artist\". By the middle of the decade he was doing editorial cartoons and a handful of comic strips such as Flivvers and When You Were a Boy, both running between 1916 and 1917. During 1917 he moved to the Hearst organization, where he worked until 1940. That year he started the comic strip Over Here, which described common situations from different points of view. By 1918, the initially sparse collection of characters was settled on the Piffles, which were a typical American family of the time. Among them were \"Calamity Jane\", who was permanently pessimistic; \"Comedian\", who had a penchant for bad jokes; \"Willie\" the trouble-making kid, and love-struck couple \"Hon\" and \"Dearie\", who became the feature's titular characters between 1919 and 1921, when it became The Piffle Family. Callahan's other strip beginning around 1922 was Freddie, the Sheik, centering on a young college graduate and his attempts to court women and make money. This quickly became Callahan's most successful work: By 1923-24, the strip merged with The Piffle Family and gained a Sunday page, being also featured in some Wrigley's chewing gum ads with other popular King Features characters. In spite of Freddie's popularity, in 1928-29 Callahan replaced it with ''Clarabelle's Cousin'' in order to cash in with the \"pretty girl\" melodrama strip boom. By late 1930 however it became a crime-adventure strip for a few months until ending in early 1931. Both strips' Sunday editions ran a topper called ''Dizzy's Eating House'', about a low-rate diner and its scheming owner. Chic Young briefly worked for Callahan as an assistant around 1923 after being hired by KFS. Callahan's style proved influential on Young, who further developed it with his own strips Dumb Dora and Blondie. After a stint as an editorial cartoonist, Callahan revived the Piffle family format with Home, Sweet Home, which ran between 1935 and 1940. After a period as a freelance artist, he found employment in the comic book industry for Dell Publishing (where he worked on Tillie the Toiler stories) and DC Comics. Callahan died in 1954 of a heart attack while playing tennis.

Baryons and mesons are both hadrons, which are particles composed solely of quarks or both quarks and antiquarks. The term baryon is derived from the Greek \"βαρύς\" (barys), meaning \"heavy\", because, at the time of their naming, it was believed that baryons were characterized by having greater masses than other particles that were classed as matter. Until a few years ago, it was believed that some experiments showed the existence of pentaquarks – baryons made of four quarks and one antiquark. The particle physics community as a whole did not view their existence as likely by 2006. On 13 July 2015, the LHCb collaboration at CERN reported results consistent with pentaquark states in the decay of bottom Lambda baryons (Λ). Since baryons are composed of quarks, they participate in the strong interaction. Leptons, on the other hand, are not composed of quarks and as such do not participate in the strong interaction. The most famous baryons are the protons and neutrons that make up most of the mass of the visible matter in the universe, whereas electrons, the other major component of atoms, are leptons. Each baryon has a corresponding antiparticle known as an antibaryon in which quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks. For example, a proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark, while its corresponding antiparticle, the antiproton, is made of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Tata Ace is a mini truck launched in May 2005 by Tata Motors in India.

In Belgium, it was known as the Combi, and in Taiwan the latter generation was marketed as the Estratto. It was also called the Subaru E10 and Subaru E12 respectively in some places, the names referring to the size of the engines. The Sumo shared many characteristics with the Sambar, except it had extended front and rear bumpers and a larger engine borrowed from the Subaru Justy. Because of these modifications, it didn't conform to kei car regulations, which stipulate the maximum dimensions of the vehicle and the maximum engine displacement requirements, which then determine the vehicle tax to be paid. It was launched with the option of four-wheel drive and powered by 1.0- and 1.2-litre 3-cylinder EF engines based on those used in the Subaru Justy although in the van they were rear mounted. Somewhat unusual for a microvan, the 1,200 cc Sumo could be ordered with selectable 4WD, operated via a gear stick mounted button. In normal driving conditions, only the rear wheels were driven, as there was no central differential to allow highway driving in 4WD mode. In 1994, Subaru's Full Time 4WD (S-AWD) was added to the options list with the ECVT transmission only and a viscous coupling. An oil cooler was installed on European versions to better facilitate light duty towing. The Sumo was discontinued when the sixth generation Sambar was introduced, and the market that the Sumo was targeted at was refocused towards the Subaru Forester, which, in comparison to the Sumo, had permanent 4WD, a more potent 2.5 L boxer engine and increased cargo capacity. In Japan, the Domingo market segment is now served by the Subaru Exiga, which is capable of carrying up to seven passengers. A more passenger car-like Subaru Domingo high-roof van with 997 cc, later 1,189 cc engines and coil springs at the rear was added in October 1983. It had a length of 341/342.5 cm and a width of 143 cm. This vehicle would stay available well after the release of the next generation Sambar. In the export the smaller Sambar received a 665 cc engine and the vehicle was called Subaru 700 (length 322.5 cm).","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Salduero is a municipality located in the province of Soria, Castile and León, Spain.

A food chain also shows how the organisms are related with each other by the food they eat. Each level of a food chain represents a different trophic level. A food chain differs from a food web, because the complex network of different animals' feeding relations are aggregated and the chain only follows a direct, linear pathway of one animal at a time. Natural interconnections between food chains make it a food web. A common metric used to quantify food web trophic structure is food chain length. In its simplest form, the length of a chain is the number of links between a trophic consumer and the base of the web and the mean chain length of an entire web is the arithmetic average of the lengths of all chains in a food web. Food chains were first introduced by the African-Arab scientist and philosopher Al-Jahiz in the 9th century and later popularized in a book published in 1927 by Charles Elton, which also introduced the food web concept.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Centeno is a surname.

The first tropical cyclone, Hurricane Allison, developed on June 2, while the season's final storm, Hurricane Tanya, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November 1. There were four particularly destructive hurricanes during the season, including Luis, Marilyn, Opal and Roxanne. Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn both caused catastrophic damage in the Leeward Islands and Virgin Islands. The former storm was the first hurricane to affect those regions since Hurricane Hugo, while the latter was the most devastating cyclone on those islands since Hugo in 1989. Opal, the strongest and most intense storm of the season, caused devastation along portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States. Roxanne, a rare late-season major hurricane, caused significant damage when it made landfall in Quintana Roo. Additionally, Erin produced moderate damage in Florida.

The circuit has two associated phone numbers. When one side of the loop is called (side A), the caller receives a test tone of approximately 1000 Hz (milliwatt test). When the second number (side B) is called, it produces dead silence, but the party on side A hears the milliwatt test tone drop, and is connected to the person on side B. The purpose of the loop around test is to allow circuit testing to a distant central office without needing a person at the far end. The technician can send a tone down either line and measure the response tone on the second line to determine the path loss parameters. When a line is connected to side A, multiple telephone lines, within limits, may connect to side B and thus be connected into a conference with the person on side A.  The function of the tone on side A was to alert those already connected, when somebody called the B side and connected. Teenagers discovered that the test facility could be used as party lines, chat rooms or alternate phone number and would dial up the primary number and wait for someone at random to call its mate.

An episode in August 1964 featured Mrs Smallgood, a parody of her, who was depicted launching a \"Freedom from Sex\" campaign. A scene with a prostitute was cut from another episode of the series, after a television studio worker leaked an advance copy of the script to her.

Turner resigned from the series. A leader in The Times criticised the series for suggesting councillors were less than honest. With the exception of Peter Black in the Daily Mail, national critics dismissed the series. The reviewer in The Guardian faulted it for \"amateurish performances\" and described it as \"a new low in tastelessness.\" Television programmers from this era were often wiped, discarded or not recorded at all if they went out live.

It became common practice to attribute a \"reasonability\" score between 1 and 5, where 5 would indicate that a party had acted reasonably and would be entitled to the full sympathy of the court.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Nowogród is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Łęczna, within Łęczna County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 24, 1993. In the episode, Howard and Bayliss attempt to quit smoking, Gee discovers secret asbestos removal in the squad room, and Munch and Bolander investigate the beating death of a 14-year-old boy. The episode was written by James Yoshimura and Tom Fontana, and was directed by Wayne Ewing, who doubled as director of photography. The episode featured a cameo appearance by film director and Baltimore native John Waters as a bartender. \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" was originally supposed to be the first season finale, but the episode \"Night of the Dead Living\" was moved to the end of the season because NBC programmers felt it was too slow-paced to show any earlier in the season. During one scene, Munch and Bolander convince a suspect the copy machine is a dangerous lie-detector machine. This was inspired by a real-life trick used by the Baltimore Police Department and documented in David Simon's 1991 non-fiction book , on which the series was based. It was later used in an episode of Simon's police drama series, The Wire. Since ratings for Homicide had gradually declined throughout the season, NBC announced a decision about whether the series would be renewed would depend on the Nielsen ratings of the final four episodes, including \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\".

Since then, the Centre has grown from a small start up into a globally renowned meeting platform for ICSOs. To better reflect the work of the Centre and its international focus, on 1 July 2013 the Centre changed its name to International Civil Society Centre. The Centre is owned by 15 ICSOs: ADRA International, Amnesty International, CARE International, CBM International,  ChildFund Alliance, HelpAge International, Islamic Relief Worldwide, Oxfam International, Plan International, Sightsavers International, SOS Children's Villages, Transparency International, VSO International, World Vision International and WWF International. The International Civil Society Centre’s work focuses on three main areas: Leadership Support – The Centre runs workshops and conferences for civil society practitioners to provide opportunities for exchange, peer learning, networking and collaboration. Flagship events are Vision Works, Global Perspectives and the Senior Leaders Week. Future Trends – The Centre scans the horizon for developments which could determine the future relevance of ICSOs and their work. It identifies opportunities and threats and develops guidance for ICSOs on how to navigate change. Since 2010 the Centre has engaged in facilitating and streamlining the discussions on the Post-2015 Development Agenda. Sector Services – The Centre offers coordination and support services for joint projects of ICSOs, e.g. by hosting the Secretariat of the INGO Accountability Charter.

The facility is currently being decommissioned and is transitioning to a SAFSTOR condition. The power plant was completed and licensed to operate in December 1976, and operated safely for 33 years until shutdown in September 2009. It was the third plant built as part of the Crystal River Energy Complex (CREC) which contains a single nuclear power plant, while sharing the site with four operational fossil fuel power plants. The Crystal River reactor went offline in September 2009 for refueling, OTSG replacement (once through steam generator), and 20% power up-rate outage. In preparing the containment building for making the opening to replace the two OTSG's, tendons in the containment building wall were detensioned. During the concrete removal in creating the opening workers discovered a large gap in the concrete of the containment building wall. The main cause of the gap, which further engineering analysis determined was a large delamination, was attributed to the scope and sequence of the tendon detensioning. The plant had originally been scheduled to restart in April 2011, but the project encountered a number of delays. Repairs were successful, but additional delamination began to occur in adjacent bays. After several months of analyzing options, Duke Energy senior executives announced in February 2013 that the Crystal River Nuclear Plant would be permanently shut down.

The Icelandic breed is one of the Northern European short-tailed sheep, which exhibit a fluke-shaped, naturally short tail. The Icelandic is a mid-sized breed, generally short-legged and stocky, with face and legs free of wool. The fleece of the Icelandic sheep is dual-coated and occurs in white and a variety of other colors, including a range of browns, grays, and blacks. They exist in both horned and polled strains. Generally left unshorn for the winter, the breed is very cold-hardy. Multiple births are very common in Icelandic ewes, with a lambing percentage of 175% - 220%. A gene also exists in the breed called the Þoka gene, and ewes carrying it have been known to give birth to triplets, quadruplets, quintuplets, and even sextuplets on occasion. Ewes can be mated as lambs as early as five to seven months, although many farmers wait until the ewe's second winter before allowing them to breed. They are seasonal breeders and come into estrus around October. The breeding season can last up to four months. Rams become mature early and can start breeding as early as five months. Descended from the same stock as the Norwegian Spelsau, brought to Iceland by the first settlers, Icelandic sheep have been bred for a thousand years in a very harsh environment. Consequently, they are quite efficient herbivores.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Edgerton Park Arena was an indoor arena in Rochester, New York. The building was originally constructed in 1892 as the drill hall for a training school for delinquent boys. When the school moved early in the 20th century, the building was turned into an indoor sports arena and exhibition hall. An artificial ice-making system was installed in 1935. The first professional team to use the building was the Rochester Cardinals hockey team in 1935-36. The Cardinals played in the International Hockey League and were a farm team of the New York Americans of the National Hockey League. Rochester could have been a charter member of the International-American Hockey League which formed in the summer of 1936 upon the merger of the IHL and the Canadian-American Hockey Leagues. However, the Cardinals went into receivership before the end of the 1935–36 season and no suitable owner could be found to operate the team. Also, the arena sat only 3,500 for hockey and officials of the new league wanted a minimum capacity of 5,000. The City of Rochester, the arena's owners, refused to expand the building. This refusal to expand the building meant Rochester had to wait until the Community War Memorial Arena (now Blue Cross Arena at the War Memorial) opened in 1955 to join the American Hockey League. Rochester was awarded a new franchise in the American Hockey League in 1956 after Pittsburgh withdrew. The Rochester Americans began play in the 1956-57 season. In 1940 the International-American Hockey League changed its name to the American Hockey League. The AHL is now the premier minor league in professional hockey. Edgerton Park Arena was the primary home of the NBA's Rochester Royals from 1945 to 1955. The Royals moved into the new Rochester Community War Memorial for the 1955–56 NBA season. But because of periodic scheduling conflicts and the two-month-long 1956 American Bowling Congress Finals scheduled for the War Memorial, the Royals returned to the Arena to play several games during the 1955–56 season.

This bill changed the entire face of the Maryland utility industry. The past several years have seen a flurry of changes in the energy industry in Maryland. In 1999, the Maryland General Assembly, under pressure from state manufacturers, enacted legislation that would cause the electric industry in Maryland to become deregulated. This bill, the Electric Customer Choice and Competition Act of 1999, was passed though the Maryland General Assembly with many Democratic and every Republican legislator's support. The bill was signed into law by Democratic Governor Parris Glendening who was not in favor of deregulation, but was threatened with an override if he opted to veto. Prior to this legislation, the local electric utility was in charge of procuring and delivering power to the people in their service territory. Under the new legislation, the consumer could choose to continue purchasing power from the local utility (known as Standard Offer Service (SOS) or Provider of Last Resort (POLR)) or to purchase power from an electric retail supplier. The local utility would still be responsible for the delivery of the power. As of 2012, Maryland residents had the 15th highest electricity rates in the United States and average monthly residential electric bills in Maryland were the 4th highest in the nation. According to the Maryland Public Service Commission, Maryland considered deregulating “to put downward pressure on costs, thus providing consumers with the lowest possible prices for electricity, to allow all customers to choose their power supplier, to provide incentives for the creation and development of innovative products and services.\" The Maryland General Assembly placed several stipulations in the legislation designed to foster competition and maintain a level playing field between the retail suppliers and the local utilities. First, the utility would be required to eliminate their generation plants, either through sale or through transfer to a non-regulated business unit. This would force both the suppliers and the utility to use the wholesale energy market to procure power. Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE) chose to transfer its generation to Constellation Generation Group. Both BGE and Constellation Generation Group are subsidiaries of Constellation Energy. Second, customers would be forced to stay on POLR rates for a number of years. During this time, POLR rates would remain frozen at a certain rate. This frozen rate was set between 3% and 7.5% lower than 1999 prices. Some companies, like BGE, had not increased their electricity rates since 1993. Therefore, in this period, customers would be paying less than for electricity than they had six years prior. Once that time was over, customers could shop for a different supplier and POLR rates would change from the capped rate to the market rate. The amount of time that rates would be frozen varied by company and by customer class (residential, commercial, industrial, etc.). Over a period of 6 years, various customers’ rates became unfrozen without incident. In 2007, however, that changed. In 2007, one of Maryland’s largest groups, BGE’s customers, was slated to move to market rates. Enormous rate increases in the wholesale electricity industry at that time meant that, while their rates would become comparable to other Maryland utilities, BGE customers would have their rates increased by 72%. This increase, greater than any other utility and coupled with election year politics, created a huge outcry.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Gmina Mogilany is a rural gmina (administrative district) in Kraków County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland.

Having been given a feminine name, that was the only soft thing about him as he was a marauder on the left wing, and played an 'inner' to Samiullah Khan during the later part of his career. He ran shivers down the spines of opposition defences with his tremendous ball control and situational awareness. To opposing teams, he was a nemesis, virtually unstoppable on his day and more than a handful on several other occasions. In the early 1970s, he was the most acrobatic Pakistani forward and by the mid 1970s, he had become such a force that his absence from the field through injury was a major cause of the 'Green Shirts' narrowly losing two high-profile matches: the 1975 Hockey World Cup final against India at Kuala Lumpur and the 1976 Montreal Olympics against Australia in the Semis. On both occasions, Pakistan went down 2–1 in controversial circumstances. Shahnaz also had a 'good hockey head' over his shoulders.

The abbreviation PII is widely accepted in the U.S. context, but the phrase it abbreviates has four common variants based on personal / personally, and identifiable / identifying. Not all are equivalent, and for legal purposes the effective definitions vary depending on the jurisdiction and the purposes for which the term is being used. (In other countries with privacy protection laws derived from the OECD privacy principles, the term used is more often \"personal information\", which may be somewhat broader: in Australia's Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) \"personal information\" also includes information from which the person's identity is \"reasonably ascertainable\", potentially covering some information not covered by PII.) European and other data protection regimes, which centre primarily around the General Data Protection Regulations, the term \"personal data\" is significantly broader, and determines the scope of the regulatory regime. NIST Special Publication 800-122 defines PII as \"any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.\" So, for example, a user's IP address is not classed as PII on its own, but is classified as linked PII. The concept of PII has become prevalent as information technology and the Internet have made it easier to collect PII leading to a profitable market in collecting and reselling PII. PII can also be exploited by criminals to stalk or steal the identity of a person, or to aid in the planning of criminal acts. As a response to these threats, many website privacy policies specifically address the gathering of PII, and lawmakers have enacted a series of legislation to limit the distribution and accessibility of PII. However, PII is a legal concept, not a technical concept, and as noted, it is not utilised in all jurisdictions. Because of the versatility and power of modern re-identification algorithms,  the absence of PII data does not mean that the remaining data does not identify individuals. While some attributes may not be uniquely identifying on their own, any attribute can be potentially identifying in combination with others. These attributes have been referred to as quasi-identifiers or pseudo-identifiers. While such data may not constitute PII in the United States, it is highly likely to remain personal data under European data protection law.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"(née Hirao, born August 30, 1975) is an athlete from Japan, who competes in triathlon.

When the amount of oxygen increases, the flame shortens, its color darkens, and it hisses and roars. With some exceptions (e.g., platinum soldering in jewelry), the oxidizing flame is usually undesirable for welding and soldering, since, as its name suggests, it oxidizes the metal's surface. The same principle is important in firing pottery — see Reducing atmosphere. The reducing flame is the flame with low oxygen. It has a yellow or yellowish color due to carbon or hydrocarbons which bind with (or reduce) the oxygen contained in the materials processed with the flame. The reducing flame is also called the carburizing flame, since it tends to introduce carbon into the molten metal. The neutral flame is the flame in which the amount of oxygen is precisely enough for burning, and neither oxidation nor reduction occurs. A flame with a good balance of oxygen is clear blue. The reducing and neutral flames are useful in soldering and annealing.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"István Haller (18 November 1880 – 5 March 1964) was a Hungarian politician, who served as Minister of Religion and Education between 1919 and 1920.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Pro7, whose real name is Amine Rachad is a French electro-music producer and DJ, born in 1979.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":" Florida Philosophical Review  is the journal of the Florida Philosophical Association, an anonymously refereed electronic journal published biannually by the University of Central Florida Department of Philosophy.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The genus Lithium is a group of four described species of aphid wasps, occurring from Mali to Turkey","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The comic \"Fear Itself\" is a 2011 crossover comic book storyline published by Marvel Comics, consisting of a seven-issue, eponymous miniseries written by Matt Fraction and illustrated by Stuart Immonen, Wade Von Grawbadger, and Laura Martin, a prologue book by writer Ed Brubaker and artist Scot Eaton, and numerous tie-in books, including most of the X-Men family of books. \"Fear Itself\" was first announced by then-Marvel Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada, Executive Editor Tom Brevoort and X-Men group editor Axel Alonso at a press conference held at Midtown Comics Times Square on December 21, 2010.

Jean-Marie Le Pen was the party's first leader and the undisputed centre of the party from its start until his resignation in 2011. While the party struggled as a marginal force for its first ten years, since 1984 it has been the major force of French nationalism.

In the run-off, he finished a distant second to Jacques Chirac. Marine Le Pen, his daughter, was elected to succeed him. In April 2017 she temporarily stepped down in order to concentrate on being the presidential candidate and to unite voters. While her father was nicknamed the \"Devil of the Republic\" by mainstream media, Marine Le Pen pursued a policy of \"de-demonisation\" of the party by softening its image. She endeavoured to extract it from its far-right cultural roots, and to normalize it by giving it a culture of government, expelling controversial members like her father, who was suspended, and then expelled by his own party in 2015 after he referred, once again, to the Nazi gas chambers as \"a point of detail of the history of the Second World War\"; (he later set up the Blue, White and Red Rally. ).

Prior to the early 20th century, the Aleutian Islands were essentially ignored by the military of the United States, although the islands played a small role in the Bering Sea Arbitration when a number of British and American vessels were stationed at Unalaska to enforce the arbitrators' decision. By the early 20th century, a number of war strategies examined the possibility of conflict breaking out between the Empire of Japan and the United States. While the Aleutian Islands were seen as a potential staging point for invasions by either side, this possibility was dismissed owing to the islands' dismal climate. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed, after which the United States Navy began to take an interest in the islands. However, nothing of significance was to materialize until World War Two. In June 1942, the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked and captured Attu Island and Kiska. The Americans wanted to recapture the two islands, and in January the following year began their advance by capturing Amchitka without opposition. On March 26, the Battle of the Komandorski Islands ensued after the United States Navy imposed a naval blockade on the two islands to reduce the opportunities for the Japanese to keep their Attu and Kiska bases supplied. In May, Attu Island was recaptured, with a total of almost 3,000 deaths from both sides combined. The Americans then prepared to attack Kiska in August, only to find that the entire island had been evacuated by the Japanese in late July. During the recapture of Kiska by the United States, 313 men died as a result of friendly fire and a mine, despite no Japanese soldiers being present on the island. During the 1960s and early 1970s, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) executed a number of nuclear tests on the island of Amchitka in the face of vehement opposition from environmental and local indigenous groups. The first test, conducted in 1965, caused significant damage to the surrounding area, although the details of this damage were not released to the public until 1969. In 1969, the AEC executed a 'calibration shot' to determine whether Amchitka would be suitable for future tests. In 1970, the AEC announced plans to detonate a bomb named 'Cannikin', set to release a blast 385 times that released by the dropping of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.

The incumbent Parti Québécois, led by Premier René Lévesque, won re-election, defeating the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Claude Ryan. The PQ won re-election despite having lost the 1980 Quebec referendum on sovereignty-association, the party's proposal for political independence for Quebec in an economic union with the rest of Canada. To some extent, they were helped by Claude Ryan's old-fashioned campaign style: he refused to tailor sound bites for the evening news and ran a campaign generally unsuited for television coverage. Despite finishing only three percent behind the PQ, the Liberals still finished a distant second, with 42 seats to the PQ's 80. Historically, provincial elections in Quebec produce large disparities between the popular vote and the actual seat count. The Union Nationale, which had won 11 seats in a modest comeback in the 1976 general election, was reduced to five seats at dissolution by numerous floor crossings, retirements and resignations. Among the departures was that of its leader in the 1976 election, Rodrigue Biron, who crossed the floor to the PQ. The once-proud party lost all of its remaining seats, never to return. The party essentially ended at this point, though it lingered in desultory fashion until 1989.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"A protomartyr (Koine Greek, πρότος prótos \"first\" + μάρτυρας mártyras \"martyr\") is the first Christian martyr in a country or among a particular group, such as a religious order.
