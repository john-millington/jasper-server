It uses a pair of three-phase controllable bridges to produce current that is injected into a transmission line using a series transformer. The controller can control active and reactive power flows in a transmission line. The UPFC uses solid state devices, which provide functional flexibility, generally not attainable by conventional thyristor controlled systems. The UPFC is a combination of a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) and a static synchronous series compensator (SSSC) coupled via a common DC voltage link. The main advantage of the UPFC is to control the active and reactive power flows in the transmission line. If there are any disturbances or faults in the source side, the UPFC will not work.The UPFC operates only under balanced sine wave source.The controllable parameters of the UPFC are reactance in the line, phase angle and voltage. The UPFC concept was described in 1995 by L. Gyugyi of Westinghouse. The UPFC allows a secondary but important function such as stability control to suppress power system oscillations improving the transient stability of power system.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Erechthias is a genus of the fungus moth family, Tineidae.

It was built in Deep-Space Communication Center (its real name \"85 радиотехнический центр дальней связи с космическими объектами\" - \"Eighty-fifth Radiotechnical Center of Distance Communications with Space Objects\") near Yevpatoria in 1960, and consists of at least three antennas. Three of them are of the ADU-1000 design, an assembly of eight reflector antennas, each with diameter of 16 metres. At the North station, two receiving antennas were built, and a transmitter was constructed 8.5 kilometres away at the South station. Each receiving dish has a Cassegrain system with subreflectors mounted on quadrapods in front of the dishes. The dishes were welded onto the hulls of two diesel submarines and laid down onto railway bridge trusses. The ADU-1000 antennas were mounted onto steerable frames constructed from battleship gun turrets and railway bridge trusses. The Pluton complex supported all the Soviet space programs until 1978, when the Yevpatoria RT-70 radio telescope was built, then the Pluton became a backup system for the RT-70. The Pluton complex was the world's highest capacity deep space communication system prior to Goldstone in 1966. In 1961 it performed one of the world's first radar detection of the planet Venus. In June 1962 it performed the world's first successful radar detection of the planet Mercury . In February 1963 it performed successful radar detection of the planet Mars. In September–October 1963 it performed successful radar detection of the planet Jupiter.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1943 for joint work with Edward Doisy work in discovering vitamin K and its role in human physiology. Dam's key experiment involved feeding a cholesterol-free diet to chickens. He initially replicated experiments reported by scientists at the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC). McFarlane, Graham and Richardson, working on the chick feed program at OAC, had used chloroform to remove all fat from chick chow. They noticed that chicks fed only fat-depleted chow developed hemorrhages and started bleeding from tag sites. Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet. It appeared that—together with the cholesterol—a second compound had been extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. The new vitamin received the letter K because the initial discoveries were reported in a German journal, in which it was designated as Koagulationsvitamin. He was born and died in Copenhagen. He received an undergraduate degree in chemistry from the Copenhagen Polytechnic Institute (now the Technical University of Denmark) in 1920, and was appointed as assistant instructor in chemistry at the School of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine. By 1923 he had attained the post of instructor in biochemistry at Copenhagen University's Physiological Laboratory. He studied microchemistry at the University of Graz under Fritz Pregl in 1925, but returned to Copenhagen University, where he was appointed as an assistant professor at the Institute of Biochemistry in 1928, and assistant professor in 1929. During his time as professor at Copenhagen University he spent some time working abroad, and in 1934 submitted a thesis entitled Nogle Undersøgelser over Sterinernes Biologiske Betydning (Some investigations on the biological significance of the sterines) to Copenhagen University, and received the degree of Ph.D. in biochemistry. Between 1942–1945 he was a Senior Research Associate at the University of Rochester; it was during this period that he was awarded the 1943 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.

In 1989 there were 38,000 Ossetians in the region, living in 134 villages. They had been incorporated into the Georgian society with a high degree of intermarriages with Georgians. During the 1991–1992 South Ossetia War, the area was unaffected by armed confrontation, but many Ossetian families had to flee rising ethnic discord to South Ossetia and Russia's North Ossetia–Alania.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Route 787, or Highway 787, may refer to:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Steven Siegel (born 1953) is an American sculptor.

Colonial rule in the Congo began in the late 19th century. King Leopold II of Belgium attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored Congo Basin. Their ambivalence resulted in Leopold's creating a colony himself. With support from a number of Western countries, Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony, the Congo Free State, in 1885. By the turn of the century, however, the violence used by Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and a ruthless system of economic exploitation led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country, which it did by creating the Belgian Congo in 1908. Belgian rule in the Congo was based on the \"colonial trinity\" (trinité coloniale) of state, missionary and private company interests. The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that large amounts of capital flowed into the Congo and that individual regions became specialised. On many occasions, the interests of the government and private enterprise became closely tied, and the state helped companies break strikes and remove other barriers raised by the indigenous population. The country was divided into hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions, and run uniformly according to a set \"native policy\" (politique indigène). This was in contrast to the British and the French, who generally favoured the system of indirect rule whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight. The Congo had a high degree of racial segregation. The large numbers of white immigrants who moved to the Congo after the end of World War II came from across the social spectrum, but were always treated as superior to black people. During the 1940s and 1950s, the Congo had extensive urbanisation, and the colonial administration began various development programmes aimed at making the territory into a \"model colony\". One of the results was the development of a new middle class of Europeanised African \"évolués\" in the cities. By the 1950s the Congo had a wage labour force twice as large as that in any other African colony. In 1960, as the result of a widespread and increasingly radical pro-independence movement, the Congo achieved independence, becoming the Republic of Congo-Léopoldville under Patrice Lumumba and Joseph Kasa-Vubu. Poor relations between political factions within the Congo, the continued involvement of Belgium in Congolese affairs, and the intervention by major parties (mainly the United States and the Soviet Union) during the Cold War led to a five-year-long period of war and political instability, known as the Congo Crisis, from 1960 to 1965. This ended with the seizure of power by Joseph-Désiré Mobutu.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Danny Roberts (born July 19, 1977; Rockmart, Georgia) is best known for appearing on The Real World: New Orleans in 2000.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Yiorgos Batis (, also Giorgos Batis) (1885 &ndash; 10 March 1967) was one of the first rebetes influential to rebetiko music.

Similar to adults, a child's pain is often tied to emotional and psychological components. Many of the problems that cause children pain are undertreated. Untreated pain can greatly increase the chances of further complications and even death, making it important to identify the cause of pain quickly. Infants and children cannot readily identify pain depending on their level of development, so determining a method to intervene and treat pain is crucial at this early stage of life. Children can have significant pain related to epidermolysis bullosa, osteogenesis imperfecta, cancer, metabolic/neurologic diseases, palliative care, and sickle cell disease. Evidence-based approaches to managing pain in children are described with: \"Pain management practices should be based on scientific facts or agreed best practices, not on personal beliefs or opinion. The burden of proof lies with the healthcare professional, NOT the patient.\" Unfortunately, many of the problems that cause children pain are undertreated.

In their third year under head coach Hugo Bezdek, the Razorbacks compiled a 7–1 record, shut out five of eight opponents, and outscored all opponents by a combined total of 221 to 19. The 1910 seasons was the first in which the Arkansas football team was nicknamed \"Razorbacks\" instead of Cardinals. According to team lore, the change was inspired when coach Bezdek congratulated his undefeated 1909 team by saying they \"fought like a band of wild razorback hogs\". However, the razorback was gaining fame by 1906 as an indigenous Arkansan hog \"that has no fear or reason\", and there are published accounts of the nickname being in use for the football team well prior to the 1910 season. Also, in March 1910, the Arkansas Land Congress adopted a resolution to advertise the State of Arkansas by sending one of the state's razor back hogs on a cross-country publicity tour to refute the saying that \"even hogs cannot be raised in Arkansas.\" One source suggests the nickname dates to 1905. On October 22, 1910, Texas Southwestern scored to lead 12–8 with less than two minutes to play. On the ensuing kickoff return, Steve Creekmore threw a lateral pass all the way across field to Russell May who went down the sideline 75 yards for a touchdown and the 13–12 victory.

Witbooi was born in Pella in South Africa in 1780 whereto several small clans had moved from Cape Town in the second half of the 18th century. His father, Gamab, and his mother, U-eis, belonged to different tribes. At the time of their marriage the respective tribal councils agreed to merge into one larger group and decided that Gamab's and U-eis' first-born son should assume the chieftaincy of the united clan. Thus when Kido came of age in 1805, the councils made him leader of the ǀKhowesin. Under his leadership the clan trekked first to Griqualand and then around 1810 across the Oranje to Namaqualand in South-West Africa. Around 1850 Witbooi and his clan had been invited by Jonker Afrikaner to travel to Windhoek. Their fellow Nama chiefs feared that an alliance of Jonker Afrikaner and Kido Witbooi, both admired for their intelligence, would diminish their own influence in South-West Africa. ǁHawoben chief Hendrik Hendricks sent a message to chief ǁOaseb of the Khaiǁkhaun asking him to stop Kido.

Metals are generally malleable—that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking—as well as fusible (able to be fused or melted) and ductile (able to be drawn out into a thin wire). Around 90 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals; the others are nonmetals or metalloids, though elements near the boundaries of each category have been assigned variably to either (hence the lack of an exact count). Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms. Astrophysicists use the term \"metal\" to refer collectively to all elements in a star that are heavier than the lightest two, hydrogen and helium, and not just traditional metals. A star fuses lighter atoms, mostly hydrogen and helium, to make heavier atoms over its lifetime. Used in that sense, the metallicity of an astronomical object is the proportion of its matter made up of the heavier chemical elements. Many elements and compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metallic under high pressures; these are formed as metallic allotropes of non-metals, for example, physicists were able to keep hydrogen in its solid state under more than 3 million times the atmospheric pressure and deduce its metallic properties. The strength and resilience of metals has led to their frequent use in high-rise building and bridge construction, as well as most vehicles, many home appliances, tools, pipes, non-illuminated signs and railroad tracks. Precious metals were historically used as coinage.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Horilka (, ) is a Ukrainian alcoholic beverage.

Modern legal codes use the term peace officer (or in some jurisdictions, law enforcement officer) to include every person vested by the legislating state with law enforcement authority— traditionally, anyone \"sworn, badged, and armable\" who can arrest, or refer such arrest for a criminal prosecution. Hence, city police officers, county sheriffs' deputies, and state troopers are usually vested with the same authority within a given jurisdiction.

LAN is the abbreviation for local area network and in this context virtual refers to a physical object recreated and altered by additional logic. VLANs work by applying tags to network packets and handling these tags in networking systems – creating the appearance and functionality of network traffic that is physically on a single network but acts as if it is split between separate networks. In this way, VLANs can keep network applications separate despite being connected to the same physical network, and without requiring multiple sets of cabling and networking devices to be deployed. VLANs allow network administrators to group hosts together even if the hosts are not directly connected to the same network switch. Because VLAN membership can be configured through software, this can greatly simplify network design and deployment. Without VLANs, grouping hosts according to their resource needs necessitates the labor of relocating nodes or rewiring data links. VLANs allow networks and devices that must be kept separate to share the same physical cabling without interacting improving simplicity, security, traffic management, or economy. For example, a VLAN could be used to separate traffic within a business due to users, and due to network administrators, or between types of traffic, so that users or low priority traffic cannot directly affect the rest of the network's functioning. Many Internet hosting services use VLANs to separate their customers' private zones from each other, allowing each customer's servers to be grouped together in a single network segment while being located anywhere in their datacenter. Some precautions are needed to prevent traffic \"escaping\" from a given VLAN, an exploit known as VLAN hopping. To subdivide a network into VLANs, one configures network equipment. Simpler equipment can partition only per physical port (if at all), in which case each VLAN is connected with a dedicated network cable. More sophisticated devices can mark frames through VLAN tagging, so that a single interconnect (trunk) may be used to transport data for multiple VLANs. Since VLANs share bandwidth, a VLAN trunk can use link aggregation, quality-of-service prioritization, or both to route data efficiently.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Cardin is a ghost town in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, United States.

That is, if for a prime q there is no smaller prime p and nonzero integer b such that q = p + 2b², then q is a Stern prime. The known Stern primes are :2, 3, 17, 137, 227, 977, 1187, 1493 . So, for example, if we try subtracting from 137 the first few squares doubled in order, we get {135, 129, 119, 105, 87, 65, 39, 9}, none of which are prime. That means that 137 is a Stern prime. On the other hand, 139 is not a Stern prime, since we can express it as 137 + 2(1²), or 131 + 2(2²), etc.In fact, many primes have more than one such representation. Given a twin prime, the larger prime of the pair has a Goldbach representation of p + 2(1²). If that prime is the largest of a prime quadruplet, p + 8, then p + 2(2²) is also valid. Sloane's lists odd numbers with at least n Goldbach representations. Leonhard Euler observed that as numbers get larger, they have more representations of the form, suggesting that there may be a largest number with no such representations; i.e., the above list of Stern primes might be not only finite, but complete. According to Jud McCranie, these are the only Stern primes from among the first 100000 primes. All the known Stern primes have more efficient Waring representations than their Goldbach representations would suggest. There also exist odd composite Stern numbers: the only known ones are 5777 and 5993. Goldbach once incorrectly conjectured that all Stern numbers are prime. (See for odd Stern numbers) Christian Goldbach conjectured in a letter to Leonhard Euler that every odd integer is of the form p + 2b² for integer b and prime p. Laurent Hodges believes that Stern became interested in the problem after reading a book of Goldbach's correspondence. At the time, 1 was considered a prime, so 3 was not considered a Stern prime given the representation 1 + 2(1²). The rest of the list remains the same under either definition.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Dieter or dieter can refer to: * A person committed to dieting","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Events from the year 1614 in art.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Tangi Miller (born February 28, 1970) is an American actress, model and dancer.

In the King James Version of the Bible the text reads: As with Matthew 1:24 Joseph's obedience to his dream is immediate and unquestioning. Rapid obedience to God is an important virtue throughout the Gospel of Matthew. The family leaves at night, which was an unusual and dangerous time to travel in that era. This quick departure highlights Joseph's rapid obedience, and also the immediacy of the threat. Matthew again is careful not to describe Joseph as the father of Jesus, only the husband of his mother. That the Gospel of Luke does not mention this sojourn at all and rather has Jesus in the town of Nazareth within days of his birth. This has inspired a number of attempts to reconcile the two gospels. At the time Egypt controlled Gaza, only a few miles from Bethlehem. Some evangelicals thus feel that the family merely made this brief, and unremarkable journey, and did not go to Egypt itself. However at the time Egypt generally referred to the Nile Valley and most readers would have interpreted the term much the same way modern readers would. If the author of Matthew was referring to Gaza he was creating something of a false impression. Bethlehem to the Nile Valley is about 150 miles, and the journey would have taken at least a week. The Flight into Egypt is a well known part of the Biblical story, and it is one very frequently depicted in works of art. However this brief verse is the only information the canon scriptures give to this voyage. Most of the traditions about this voyage come from the New Testament Apocrypha. These later works have a number of miraculous stories occurring on the voyage with palm trees bowing before the Infant Jesus and the beasts of the desert paying him homage. An encounter with the two thieves that would later be crucified alongside Jesus is also reported. In these tales the holy family are joined by Jesus' nurse Salome. The story of the palm trees makes it into the Qur'an with Sura 19:24 relating the event. Why Matthew includes this trip to Egypt has also been debated by scholars. Stendhal's interpretation of Matthew 2 is that it is a lengthy apology for why the messiah left Bethlehem, a town of great religious importance, for the minor and little known Nazareth in Gentile Galilee. However, the side trip to Egypt does little to advance this argument. One view is that Matthew is presenting Jesus as Moses, but in reverse, to draw parallels with that other great Jewish leader. France feels that the trip to Egypt is part of Matthew's greater interest in geography. France notes that in Matthew 4:24-25 the entire Holy Land is described as being aware of Jesus, while the arrival of the magi \"from the east\" in Matthew 2:1 is a reference to Mesopotamia. This leaves out only one major portion of the Jewish world: Egypt. France feels that this brief trip was added to cover this omission.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"A twiddle factor, in fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms, is any of the trigonometric constant coefficients that are multiplied by the data in the course of the algorithm. This term was apparently coined by Gentleman &amp; Sande in 1966, and has since become widespread in thousands of papers of the FFT literature. More specifically, \"twiddle factors\" originally referred to the root-of-unity complex multiplicative constants in the butterfly operations of the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm, used to recursively combine smaller discrete Fourier transforms. This remains the term's most common meaning, but it may also be used for any data-independent multiplicative constant in an FFT. The Prime-factor FFT algorithm is one unusual case in which an FFT can be performed without twiddle factors, albeit only for restricted factorizations of the transform size.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Shenyang J-11 (: 歼-11), with NATO reporting name Flanker B+, is a single-seat, twin-engine jet fighter, whose airframe is based on the Soviet-designed Sukhoi Su-27 air superiority fighter.

Going with his father to Constantinople, he became physician to Sultan Sulaiman I. This \"famous prince and great physician,\" as he is called by Judah ibn Verga, accompanied the monarch on all his expeditions, enjoying great favor on account of his knowledge and skill. Hamon was a fine linguist, versed in Arabic, Turkish, and Persian, and was a patron of Jewish learning. He printed some Hebrew works at Constantinople as early as 1515 and 1516. He also built in that city, at his own cost, a school which was presided over by the learned Joseph Taitazak of Salonica. He did not, however, translate the Pentateuch into Persian, nor the prayers of the Israelites into Turkish, as Manasseh b. Israel records, but he had Jacob Tavus' Persian Pentateuch translation, together with Saadia's Arabic translation, printed at his own expense in 1546. Hamon, who was everywhere highly respected on account of his firm character and philanthropy, was a fearless advocate of his coreligionists. When about 1545 the Jews of Amasya were falsely accused of having murdered a Christian for ritual purposes, and the innocence of those that had been executed was established soon after by the reappearance of the missing man, Hamon induced the sultan to decree that thenceforward no accusation of the kind should be entertained by any judge of the country, but should be referred to the royal court (see Danon in El Progreso, i. 148 et seq., where a legendary account of the event is given, probably taken from ''Me'ora'ot 'Olam,'' Constantinople, 1756). Hamon was also called upon to decide communal difficulties. After an affray which arose in the Jewish community of Salonica, Hamon summoned the instigators to Constantinople and induced the sultan to send a judge to Salonica to investigate the affair and to punish the guilty ones (see Danon, l.c. i. 162 et seq., 178 et seq., where several of Hamon's Hebrew letters are reprinted). The sultan, at Hamon's request, exempted the latter's descendants from all taxes.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Leslie Gordon Cowie was an Australian rugby league player, a fine lock forward for the champion South Sydney Rabbitohs teams of the 1950s and an Australian national representative.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Takahiro Arai (Japanese: 新井 貴浩, born January 30, 1977 in Naka-ku, Hiroshima) is a Japanese professional baseball player for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball.

The symmetry of the moleculeapparent in corresponding \"top\" and \"bottom\" halves of the molecule, connected together by a carbon-carbon bond between the two benzene rings (phenyl rings, see picture)--allows the two five-membered rings to participate in bonding on opposite sides of a metal atom, creating a type of sandwich compound. A prerequisite for the bonding is deprotonation of the cyclopentadiene-type five-membered ring to form the two anionic carbocycles that bind to the metal atom. Metals studied with 2,2'-bis(2-indenyl) biphenyl include titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. The ligand and its complexes were originally prepared by the research group of the late Brice Bosnich at The University of Chicago. Zirconium and hafnium complexes made from this ligand were found to be active catalysts for the polymerization of the smallest alkenes--compounds with carbon-carbon double bonds--namely, ethylene and propylene.

It was founded by the Romans, at the beginning of our era, to replace the oppidum of Vermand as the capital of theViromandui(Celtic Belgian people occupying the Vermandois). This is proved by three sources. In the 2nd century AD, the geographer Ptolemy (II, 9, 6) states: Μεθ ους Ουιρομανδυες, ων πολις Αυγυστα Ουιρομανδυων: Viromandui, which city is Augusta Viromanduorum. In the middle of the 3rd century, two inscriptions found in Rome, are dedicated by Praetorians. The first one ( Corpus inscriptionum latinarum VI, 32550 = 2822, before 244), says : ex Belgica provincia [civitatis Avg] Veromand (orvm); the second (CIL VI, 32551 = 2821 = H. Dessau,Inscriptiones Latinae selectae, Berlin: Weidmann, 3 t. in 5 vol., 1892–1916, No. 2096), dated 246, is more comprehensive: civ (itatis) ex prov (incia) Avg Belgica (vstae) Viromandvorv (orum). It received the name Augusta Viromanduorum, Augusta of the Viromandui, in honor of the Emperor Augustus. The site is a ford which allowed to cross the Somme river. Several main roads crossing it, coming from Reims, Soissons, Amiens and Cambrai. The discoveries and archaeological excavations are still too few to well known that town. However, it appears that it occupied an area of 40 to 60 hectares, which puts it among the medium cities of Gaul. From an historical perspective, the main question is what was its status in Late Antiquity. The name of the small Roman town (close to 11 km) Vermand, which seems to come from Veromandis has led to a debate about a possible loss of the rank of civitas capital in the Late Roman period. Archaeology, in the current state of knowledge (which remains incomplete, it must be pointed out) tipped the balance in favour of the \"transfer\", as the city of Augusta Viromanduorum seems like the deserted in 4th century. On the contrary, the remains of this period are abundant in Vermand, well known site in the archaeological literature for its late Roman necropolis (800 tombs excavated in the 19th and 20th centuries).
