{"lines":[{"value":"The Kerikeri River rises in the Puketi Forest inland from Kerikeri and flows into the western extremity of the Bay of Islands in northern New Zealand. A long stream flowing into Raglan Harbour in Waikato also has the same name but it is unofficial. Slightly less than long, the Northland river is hardly a significant waterway, but because it terminates at one of the most important historic sites in the country, the Stone Store Basin, it is known to countless thousands of tourists who visit Kerikeri each year. The freshwater river falls over a ford into the Pacific Ocean, in the upper extremity of Kerikeri Inlet, a northwestern arm of the Bay. The ford replaced a bridge which crossed at that point for decades, but which needed to be demolished to protect Kerikeri's historic buildings in the basin. A replacement bypass bridge was constructed several hundred metres upstream and opened in 2008. A pedestrian bridge was constructed around 2010, upstream from the ford. The area is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the country, because of its history and photogenic buildings. The Stone Store was built in 1832 and is the oldest stone building extant in New Zealand. Adjacent is the Mission House, previously known as \"Kemp House\", which was built in 1822 and is the oldest surviving wooden house in Australia and New Zealand. Behind, up a hill, is St James' Church which has been on the site since 1829 (although in its current form only since 1878). Part of the history of the river is that it was used by chief Hongi Hika whose Kororipo Pa is about across the basin from the ford. Hongi used the river and tracks beside it to commute to Kororipo, his coastal pa, which played a significant part in the historic Musket Wars. A popular walking track from the basin leads about five kilometres to the river’s spectacular Rainbow Falls. One of the first hydroelectric power stations in New Zealand was constructed on the river, and remains of it can be seen from the track.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Thomson River is a perennial river that forms part of the Lake Eyre Basin, situated in the central west and western regions of Queensland, Australia.

Patrick was born at “Anderson Place,” in then Charlestown Township, Pennsylvania now Schuylkill Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. He was the first person of European descent born in Charlestown Township. He was educated in Philadelphia and returned home to farm. He built, opened and taught at the first school house in the Valley Forge area. He was married 3 times, the first time to Hannah Martin in historic Christ Church, Philadelphia . Patrick was captain of a company of Chester County men who served in the French and Indian War. At the time of the Revolution, Patrick was serving on Anthony Wayne's first Chester County Committee of Safety. The Assembly sent a Captain's Commission to him, and, although an older man, being 55 at the time, Patrick accepted it, called together his old soldiers, and the entire company of fifty-six men enlisted. His company was known as the Chester County Minute Men of 1775. Patrick paid for and outfitted his entire company but was never compensated by the Continental Congress, and lost half of his farm, which he had mortgaged to a neighbor. In March 1776, he was appointed senior captain of the Pennsylvania Battalion of Musketry (sometimes called Samuel Atlee's Battalion)(Pennsylvania Archives»Series 5»Volume II»The Musketry Battalion.

Diodorus assigns him a rule of thirty-five years, but it appears that his rule of Cius was interrupted during that period. What circumstances led to his expulsion or subjection are unknown; nothing is heard of him until his death in 302 BCE. However, it appears that he had submitted to the Macedonian Antigonus, who, to prevent him from joining the league of Cassander and his confederates, arranged for his assassination in Cius. According to Lucian, he was at least eighty-four years of age at the time of his death, which makes it likely that he is the same person as the Mithridates, son of Ariobarzanes, who in his youth circumvented and put to death Datames. King Mithridates I of Pontus was his kinsman, although it is not known whether he was his son. Therefore, it is likely that he was the same Mithradates, son of Ariobarzanes prince of Cius, who is mentioned by Xenophon as having betrayed his father, and the same circumstance is alluded to by Aristotle. During the Satraps' Revolt in the 360s BCE, Mithridates tricked Datames into believing in him. But in the end he arranged for Datames' murder in 362 BCE. Similarly, Mithridates gave his own father Ariobarzanes of Phrygia over to his Persian overlord, so Ariobarzanes was crucified in 362 BCE. Presumably he was not the same Mithridates who accompanied the younger Cyrus in c. 401 BCE - there is no proof of this. Neither is he the Mithridates mentioned by Xenophon as satrap of Cappadocia and Lycaonia in the late 5th century BCE. Between 362 and 337 BCE the family fiefdom of Cius in Mysia was held by Ariobarzanes II (possibly Mithridates' brother).","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Pink Mountaintops is the debut album by Pink Mountaintops released by Jagjaguwar in 2004.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Veveaham School, Dharapuram is a boys and girls separate residential higher secondary school in Tirupur District, India in Tamil Nadu.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"New York State Route 306 (NY 306) is a north–south state highway in western Rockland County, New York, in the United States.

The display is usually crepuscular, or given throughout moonlit nights. The behaviour is generally characteristic of the genera Coenocorypha, Gallinago and Lymnocryptes. Sounds made by the closely related woodcocks (Scolopax spp.) in the course of their 'roding' display flights may be homologous to drumming.

Questions about work day and free day sleep schedules, work details, and lifestyle provide data to aid in the understanding of how biological clocks work in social life, such as Roenneberg's conclusions of social jetlag. The MCTQ categorizes each participant into one of seven chronotype groups, and utilizes data on participants’ midsleep phase and sleep debt to survey what \"type\" of sleeper each person is. From these data, the MCTQ offers methods to make up for sleep debt (if any), and offers suggestions on what to do to wake up earlier or sleep later.

During his senior year in 1979, Carlson passed for 2188 yards and 11 touchdowns, which was good enough to earn him Team MVP honors on a squad that finished 4-6-1 under first-year head coach Joe Salem. During his tenure with the Gophers, Carlson competed with Wendell Avery for the starting quarterback position, both having varying success at different times during this period. Mark Carlson first made a name for himself during his sophomore season in 1977 in one of the biggest wins in Gopher history. The Gophers were scheduled to face the vaunted Michigan Wolverine team in their annual Little Brown Jug game, which would be played at the Gopher’s Memorial Stadium. Michigan was coming into the contest as the number one ranked team in the country with a 6-0 record. The Gophers - who were 4-2 at the time with impressive wins over Washington and UCLA – still were considered major underdogs against the Wolverines and Bo Schembechler. What added to the Gopher’s uncertainty was that they still didn’t know who their starting quarterback was going to be. After having former Gopher hero Butch Nash give a rousing pep talk on the Friday night before the game, Minnesota’s head coach Cal Stoll met with all three of his top quarterbacks to decide who would be the starter for the big game. \"I kept looking in their eyes when I talked to them.\" Stoll would later say, - \"Mark Carlson was looking right back into my eyes. I made a gut decision right then that he would be my quarterback.\" Sure enough Carlson, a sophomore who hadn’t played a minute all season up to that point, was under center as the Gopher’s starting quarterback. The Gophers, with a tremendous defensive effort and the solid kicking of Paul Rogind, ended up shocking Michigan 16-0 to earn their first Little Brown Jug since 1967 and handing the Wolverines their first shutout in 112 games. Mark Carlson has a son named Kevin Carlson who ended up as a catcher in baseball, who played for both the Minnesota Gophers and the St. Paul Saints.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Wojmiany () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Górowo Iławeckie, within Bartoszyce County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, in northern Poland, close to the border with the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia.

Adults of the genus measured long and  tall. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Xingxiulong is most closely related to its contemporary Jingshanosaurus, although an alternative position outside of both the Sauropodiformes and Massospondylidae is also plausible. Despite their close relationship, Xingxiulong prominently differs from Jingshanosaurus - and from most basal sauropodomorphs - in having a number of sauropod-like traits. These include a sacrum containing four vertebrae; a pubis with an exceptionally long top portion; and the femur, the first and fifth metatarsals on the foot, and the scapula being wide and robust.

An innovative architect in 1920's and 1930's Germany, Mies was the last director of the Bauhaus, a seminal school in modern architecture. After Nazism's rise to power, and with its strong opposition to modernism (leading to the closing of the Bauhaus itself), Mies fled to the United States. He accepted the position to head the architectural school at the Illinois Institute of Technology, in Chicago. Mies sought to establish a new architectural style that could represent modern times just as Classical and Gothic did for their own eras. He created an influential twentieth-century architectural style, stated with extreme clarity and simplicity. His mature buildings made use of modern materials such as industrial steel and plate glass to define interior spaces. He strove toward an architecture with a minimal framework of structural order balanced against the implied freedom of unobstructed free-flowing open space. He called his buildings \"skin and bones\" architecture. He sought an objective approach that would guide the creative process of architectural design, but he was always concerned with expressing the spirit of the modern era.

Its recorded history reaches back to the settlement of Iceland. One of the country's original settlers was Skallagrímur Kveldúlfsson, who claimed the area around Borg as his land, built a farm and made his home there. His son Egill Skallagrímsson then continued to live and farm at Borg á Mýrum. Borg á Mýrum has had a church ever since Iceland was Christianised around the year 1000, shortly after Egill's death. The present church at Borg was built in 1880, and is notable for its geographical alignment: it faces North-South, which is not traditional for Icelandic churches. It is also unusual in that the church building does not stand in the church yard, but is separated from it by the farm buildings. The altarpiece, depicting Christ blessing the little children, is unique in Iceland for being painted in Pre-Raphaelite style. The artist was W.G. Collingwood, who visited Iceland in 1897. Collingwood made an extensive trip around the country in preparation for an illustrated book he published on \"saga-steads\", the locations of the Icelandic Sagas. At Borg á Mýrum Collingwood found 'the historical homestead, still partly built of oak-beams carved and moulded in the ancient times'. This building has not survived, but there is a twentieth-century monument to Egill by the sculptor Ásmundur Sveinsson. The abstract sculpture represents him as the poet of Sonatorrek in which he grieves for two of his sons, Gunnar and Böðvarr.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Sandae noli is a regional variant of Korean mask dance drama. According to some scholars, sandae noli may be the root form of many other Korean mask dance dramas today, as it was created and managed by the Sandae Dogam, a government office in charge of providing entertainment both in the capital and in important regional centers. This Sandae Dogam was disbanded in the early 1600s, leaving many performers unemployed and searching for work. It is thought that the stories of these performers became modern day plays such as Songpa Sandae Noli and Yangju Byeolsandae and influenced many other performance forms in Korea.

With his trusty team, Jeff works to effectively restore these cars into dollars signs. Jeff is all about strategy; buying low and selling high is the name of his game, but deep down, Jeff would gladly hold on to every car he buys. Each one is a treasure and that’s what makes him so good at wheeling and dealing – he truly values the cars and brings that passion into the deals. He loves all cars, but is a child of the seventies and so has a true soft spot for the muscle cars of that generation – oh, and Ferraris. He definitely can’t get enough of Ferraris! But don’t let his weakness for fancy rides fool you. Jeff treats every deal as a battle, and when he goes head to head with an equal, the negotiation becomes a true chess match. Not only has Meggan been Jeff’s partner since high school, but she’s also been his longstanding financial advisor, instructing him on what cars to buy and what to sell. But she is far from the typical moneyman: she was raised in quite the car aficionado family, supplying her with an abundance of car wisdom. Meg’s disapproval on a car often prevents Jeff and the team from making a big mistake and wasting money on a non-running or non-profitable vehicle.

The operation was prompted by the invasion of Chad by a joint force of Libyan units and Chadian Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT) rebels in June 1983. While France was at first reluctant to participate, the Libyan air-bombing of the strategic oasis of Faya-Largeau starting on July 31 led to the assembling in Chad of 3,500 French troops, the biggest French intervention since the end of the colonial era. The French troops, instead of attempting to expel the Libyan forces from Chad, drew a \"line in the sand\". They concentrated their forces on the 15th parallel, the so-called \"Red Line,\" (later moved up to the 16th parallel) to block the Libyan and GUNT advance towards the N'Djamena, thus saving the Chadian President Hissène Habré. The Libyan and rebel forces also avoided attacking across the Red Line and provoking the French. The resulting impasse led to the de facto partition of Chad, with the Libyans and the GUNT in the north and Habré and the French in central and southern Chad. To end this stalemate, French President François Mitterrand and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi negotiated a mutual withdrawal of their countries' troops from Chad in September 1984. The accord was respected by the French, thus signing the end of Operation Manta, but not by the Libyans, whose forces remained in Chad until 1987 (they did, however, continue to respect the Red Line). The violation of the 15th parallel caused a renewed French intervention in Chad under Operation Epervier and the expulsion of Libyan forces from all Chad except for the Aouzou Strip the following year.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada () NI (12 June 1923 – 2 June 2017) was a noted Pakistani lawyer, served as a senior advocate at the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

Xuxa's first starring role was in Amor Estranho Amor (English title: Love Strange Love), a controversial 1982, erotic film directed by Walter Hugo Khouri. The plot involves an adult man's recollection of a short period in his life in 1937. As a teenager, he visited his mother, the favorite woman of an important politician, in a bordello owned by her, right before key political changes in Brazil. In those hours, he discovers his own sexuality. Although rather tame by today's modern standards, the movie was considered somewhat controversial by some because it contains two brief scenes of sensuality between a libertine character played by Xuxa and the teenager. She broke out on her own in 1988 in Super Xuxa contra Baixo Astral, only to rejoin the Os Trapalhões in 1989 in A Princesa Xuxa e os Trapalhões, one of the quartet's most popular movies. The formula was repeated the following year in O Mistério de Robin Hood (1990), on which Xuxa's production company Xuxa Produções acted as associate producer. In 1990 Xuxa teamed up with another hugely popular children's TV performer, Sérgio Mallandro, in a joint venture entitled Lua de Cristal. With just under 5 million spectators, it was the biggest film of the 1990s, and it guaranteed Xuxa a second box-officie hit at a time when the Brazilian film industry had all but ground to a halt. She returned to cinemas in 1999 with Xuxa Requebra. Xuxa also picked up a popular fascination with duendes and their magical powers in Xuxa e os Duendes, and the sequel, Xuxa e os Duendes 2 - No Caminho das Fadas. She released another couple of films in quick succession in 2003 and 2004, Xuxa Abracadabra and Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida. In 2009, Xuxa launched her film Xuxa em O Mistério de Feiurinha, which tells the story of what happens in fairy tales after the \"and they all lived happily ever after\" ending. The film is an adaptation of Pedro Bandeira's book O Fantástico Mistério de Feiurinha that has sold over 2 million copies.

In Mormonism, unlike most other Christian denominations, the Melchizedek priesthood is thought to be held by common mortals and not solely by either pre-Aaronic priests such as Melchizedek, or Jesus alone, as most Christians interpret the Epistle to the Hebrews. According to Joseph Smith, the name of this priesthood became Melchizedek \"because Melchizedek was such a great high priest\" and \"to avoid the too frequent repetition\" of the \"name of the Supreme Being\". Smith taught that this priesthood was on the earth since Adam received it and conferred it upon his sons Abel and Seth, and it was conferred successively upon the early biblical patriarchs. Through it Enoch led his people to become so righteous and obedient that they qualified to be translated as the City of Enoch. Noah held this priesthood, as did Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Despite being unable to read or write, Martha Llwyd composed many hymns and poems which she kept in her memory and taught to others. Her hymns became very popular and were sung far and wide during her lifetime. She was regularly visited by the Methodist leader and fellow hymn-writer William Williams Pantycelyn to discuss their work, and it is alleged that some of her hymns were published under his name. Very little of Martha Llwyd's work remains, and most of her hymns have been lost to posterity. Martha was born Martha Williams at Nantbendigaid Farm in the parish of Cynwyl Elfed, but her family moved to Y Felin farm in the neighbouring parish of Llanpumsaint when she was a baby and it was there that she grew up. In 1785 she married Dafydd Llwyd, a local blacksmith and prominent member of the village's Methodist community. The couple lived together in the centre of the village and had nine children - six boys and three girls. The rigours of raising such a large family took its toll on Martha's health and with time she became severely crippled. Nevertheless, she was a faithful member of Bethel Methodist Chapel in the village of Llanpumsaint and was often seen outdoors, carried aloft in her chair by her children or neighbours. Martha died at the age of 79, only one year after the death of her husband Dafydd Llwyd. They share a grave under the yew tree at the parish church in Llanpumsaint.

The Russian Empire collapsed with the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II and the old regime was replaced by a provisional government during the first revolution of February 1917 (March in the Gregorian calendar; the older Julian calendar was in use in Russia at the time). Alongside it arose grassroots community assemblies (called 'soviets') which contended for authority. In the second revolution that October, the Provisional Government was toppled and all power was given to the soviets. The February Revolution (March 1917) was a revolution focused around Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg), the capital of Russia at that time. In the chaos, members of the Imperial parliament (the Duma) assumed control of the country, forming the Russian Provisional Government which was heavily dominated by the interests of large capitalists and the noble aristocracy. The army leadership felt they did not have the means to suppress the revolution, resulting in Nicholas's abdication. The soviets, which were dominated by soldiers and the urban industrial working class, initially permitted the Provisional Government to rule, but insisted on a prerogative to influence the government and control various militias. The February Revolution took place in the context of heavy military setbacks during the First World War (1914–18), which left much of the Russian Army in a state of mutiny. A period of dual power ensued, during which the Provisional Government held state power while the national network of soviets, led by socialists, had the allegiance of the lower classes and, increasingly, the left-leaning urban middle class. During this chaotic period there were frequent mutinies, protests and many strikes. Many socialist political organizations were engaged in daily struggle and vied for influence within the Duma and the soviets, central among which were the Bolsheviks (\"Ones of the Majority\") led by Vladimir Lenin who campaigned for an immediate end to the war, land to the peasants, and bread to the workers. When the Provisional Government chose to continue fighting the war with Germany, the Bolsheviks and other socialist factions were able to exploit virtually universal disdain towards the war effort as justification to advance the revolution further. The Bolsheviks turned workers' militias under their control into the Red Guards (later the Red Army) over which they exerted substantial control. In the October Revolution (November in the Gregorian calendar), the Bolsheviks led an armed insurrection by workers and soldiers in Petrograd that successfully overthrew the Provisional Government, transferring all its authority to the soviets with the capital being relocated to Moscow shortly thereafter. The Bolsheviks had secured a strong base of support within the soviets and, as the now supreme governing party, established a federal government dedicated to reorganizing the former empire into the world's first socialist republic, practicing soviet democracy on a national and international scale. The promise to end Russia’s participation in the First World War was honored promptly with the Bolshevik leaders signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany in March 1918. To further secure the new state, the Cheka was established which functioned as a revolutionary security service that sought to weed out and punish those considered to be \"enemies of the people\" in campaigns consciously modeled on similar events during the French Revolution. Soon after, civil war erupted among the \"Reds\" (Bolsheviks), the \"Whites\" (counter-revolutionaries), the independence movements and the non-Bolshevik socialists. It continued for several years, during which the Bolsheviks defeated both the Whites and all rival socialists and thereafter reconstituted themselves as the Communist Party. In this way, the Revolution paved the way for the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1922. While many notable historical events occurred in Moscow and Petrograd, there was also a visible movement in cities throughout the state, among national minorities throughout the empire and in the rural areas, where peasants took over and redistributed land.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Indian Express is an English-language Indian daily newspaper.

Introduced in June 1988, it was the second MIPS implementation, succeeding the R2000 as the flagship MIPS microprocessor. It operated at 20, 25 and 33.33 MHz. The MIPS 1 instruction set is very small compared to the instruction sets of other microprocessors, such as the contemporary 80x86 and 680x0 architectures, as it includes only most commonly used instructions and supports very limited number of addressing modes. The small number of CPU instructions, as well as other instruction set features&mdash;fixed instruction length and only three different types of instruction formats&mdash;greatly simplify instruction decoding and processing. To speed up processing even further the CPU employs a 5-stage instruction pipeline. The pipeline design allows the R3000 CPU to execute most instructions at a rate close to 1 instruction per cycle. The MIPS architecture supports up to four coprocessors. In addition to the CPU core, the R3000 microprocessor includes a Control Processor (CP), which contains a Translation Lookaside Buffer and a Memory Management Unit. The CP works as a coprocessor. Besides the CP, the R3000 can also support an external R3010 numeric coprocessor and two other external coprocessors. The R3000 CPU does not include its own level 1 cache. Instead, the processor has an on-chip cache controller which controls separate external data and instruction caches. The size of each external cache can be as large as 256 KB. The CPU can access both caches during the same CPU cycle. The R3000 found much success and was used by many companies in their workstations and servers. Users included: The R3000 was a further development of the R2000 with minor improvements including larger translation lookaside buffer and faster bus to the external caches.
