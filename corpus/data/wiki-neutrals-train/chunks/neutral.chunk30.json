Consensus implies general agreement, though not necessarily unanimity.

These lead to a situation in which those within the discipline can often recognize such a consensus where it exists, but communicating to outsiders that consensus has been reached can be difficult, because the 'normal' debates through which science progresses may seem to outsiders as contestation. On occasion, scientific institutes issue position statements intended to communicate a summary of the science from the \"inside\" to the \"outside\" of the scientific community. In cases where there is little controversy regarding the subject under study, establishing what the consensus is can be quite straightforward.

Vermillion, derived from the French for \"red\" was probably so named from deposits of ochre Indians used for body painting. The Vermillion is a state-designated trout stream, managed for catch-and-release fishing of brown trout. The portion of the river that supports trout is upstream, around the towns of Farmington; Empire, and the City of Lakeville. Near the town of Vermillion, the water becomes too warm to support trout. Downstream from the falls on the south side of Hastings, the water becomes even warmer, supporting riverine species such as northern pike and freshwater drum. The Minnesota state record black crappie of 5.0 pounds was caught in the Vermillion River in 1940. An old channel of the Vermillion River continues south from Hastings on the western edge of the Mississippi valley. In the nineteenth and early twentieth century, the river was used for water power, supplying power to gristmills. A park surrounding the falls preserves the remains of a mill operated by Alexander Ramsey, one of the leading citizens of early Minnesota. The nonprofit conservation group Minnesota Trout Unlimited and its volunteers have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in physical restoration of the river and adjoining upland areas, funding four projects through grants from the state's Outdoor Heritage Fund. The Twin Cities chapter of Trout Unlimited sponsors a local community volunteer group called the Vermillion Riverkeepers. Volunteers work with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources to remove invasive non-native species such as buckthorn from several state DNR Aquatic Management Areas (AMAs), in addition to fisheries research and stream restoration projects . Another group, the Vermillion Stewards program, engages people in cleanups, restoration events and educational activities and is operated by Friends of the Mississippi River.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Quentin Anderson (July 21, 1912 – February 18, 2003) was an American literary critic and cultural historian at Columbia University.

The building of the railway station was built in two stages: the construction of the first stage was completed in December 1895; the second stage of the building (restaurant, auxiliary services of the railway station) was completed in 1904. The building is one-storey, brick-built. In a later period (presumably in the 1950s), the outer surface of the walls was plastered and coloured in two colours. Now (to the 100th anniversary of the West Siberian Railway) the building has been restored and brought into full compliance with the original project. The building has a complex shape in plan. Separate rooms are different, in their Horizontal and high-altitude dimensions, are united among themselves into a single volume stretched along the railway platform. The monument has roofing wooden structures covered with iron. The main hall and some rooms inside have vaulted ceilings, which facilitates the circulation of air inside. Large windows provide good illumination, framed by a figured masonry. The building is built in the style of \"late Baroque\". At present, the building is used as the luggage compartment of the railway station and warehouses. The building is a sample of the historical layout of the city, typical for late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, expressed in the planned integrated construction of brick buildings of public use and is the architectural heritage of the city.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Hamdan was born as Mais Abdel-Jabbar Hamdan Selim in the United Arab Emirates to a Jordanian father of Palestinian decent, and a Jordanian-Lebanese mother.

There are two types of subatomic particles: elementary particles, which according to current theories are not made of other particles; and composite particles. Particle physics and nuclear physics study these particles and how they interact. In particle physics, the concept of a particle is one of several concepts inherited from classical physics. But it also reflects the modern understanding that, at the quantum scale, matter and energy behave very differently from what much of everyday experience would lead us to expect. The idea of a particle underwent serious rethinking when experiments showed that light could behave like a stream of particles (called photons) as well as exhibiting wave-like properties. This led to the new concept of wave–particle duality to reflect that quantum-scale \"particles\" behave like both particles and waves (they are sometimes described as wavicles to reflect this). Another new concept, the uncertainty principle, states that some of their properties taken together, such as their simultaneous position and momentum, cannot be measured exactly. In more recent times, wave–particle duality has been shown to apply not only to photons but to increasingly massive particles as well. Interactions of particles in the framework of quantum field theory are understood as creation and annihilation of quanta of corresponding fundamental interactions. This blends particle physics with field theory.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"A clothes dryer, tumble dryer, drying machine or dryer is a powered household appliance that is used to remove moisture from a load of clothing, bedding and other textiles, usually shortly after they are washed in a washing machine. Otherwise, clothes may also be dried by natural evaporation and, if available, sunlight, on an outdoor or indoor clothes line or clothes horse. Many dryers consist of a rotating drum called a \"tumbler\" through which heated air is circulated to evaporate the moisture, while the tumbler is rotated to maintain air space between the articles. Using these machines may cause clothes to shrink or become less soft (due to loss of short soft fibers/lint). A simpler non-rotating machine called a \"drying cabinet\" may be used for delicate fabrics and other items not suitable for a tumble dryer.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"West Derby ( ) is a suburb in the north of Liverpool, Merseyside, England.

The first Highland Council election, however, was one year earlier, in 1995. Until 1996 councillors shadowed the regional and district councils and planned for the transfer of powers and responsibilities. Elections to the council are normally on a four-year cycle, all wards being contestable at each election. For the periods 1995 to 1999 and 1999 to 2007, each ward elected one councillor by the first past the post system. In 2007, this arrangement was replaced with one of multi-member wards, each electing three or four councillors by the single transferable vote system, to produce a form of proportional representation. The wards used from 1995 to 1999 had been subdivisions of eight council management areas, with councillors elected from each area forming an area committee. The wards created in 1999, however, were not exactly subdivisions of the management areas, management area boundaries were not adjusted to take accoont of new ward boundaries and, therefore, area committees ceased to be exactly representative of areas for which they were named and for which they took decisions.

The fungus was first discovered in 1839 by the English botanist George Gardner, after he came across some youths playing with glowing material in the streets of Villa de Natividade in Goiás state in Brazil. Initially thinking it was a firefly, he then discovered it was a mushroom—known as Flor de Coco locally—that was common locally and found on decaying palm leaves. Gardner sought to call it Agaricus phosphorescens. However, his colleague Miles Joseph Berkeley opined that the attribute was not unique, and hence described it with the specific name ''A. gardneri''. Gardner thought it resembled members of the genus Pleurotus in structure, while Berkeley felt it was more akin to the genus Panus but conceded spores were necessary for further classification. It was rediscovered in February 2005 by scientists Patricia Izar, Elisabetta Visalberghi and Dorothy Fragaszy, with the aid of Marino Gomes de Oliveira. It is larger and brighter than other known bioluminescent fungi. Marina Capelari and colleagues investigated its relationships by analysing it and close relatives genetically, and found that it was the sister taxon to Neonothopanus nambi rather than members of the genus Omphalotus and placed it in the genus Neonothopanus. The fleshy yellow mushrooms have caps that are darker in the centre fading to paler yellow or cream at the margins. Measuring wide, the cap is initially convex with a central umbo before becoming flat or even funnel-shaped with age. The decurrent and widely spaced gills are the same colour as the cap. The fibrous stipe is long by  wide. The cap and gills glow with a green light at night, more strongly than most other bioluminescent fungi.

It is within the group of cardiovascular diseases of which it is the most common type. A common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Occasionally it may feel like heartburn. Usually symptoms occur with exercise or emotional stress, last less than a few minutes, and improve with rest. Shortness of breath may also occur and sometimes no symptoms are present. Occasionally, the first sign is a heart attack. Other complications include heart failure or an abnormal heartbeat. Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, depression, and excessive alcohol. The underlying mechanism involves reduction of blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle due to atherosclerosis of the arteries of the heart. A number of tests may help with diagnoses including: electrocardiogram, cardiac stress testing, coronary computed tomographic angiography, and coronary angiogram, among others. Ways to reduce CAD risk include eating a healthy diet, regularly exercising, maintaining a healthy weight, and not smoking. Medications for diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure are sometimes used. There is limited evidence for screening people who are at low risk and do not have symptoms. Treatment involves the same measures as prevention. Additional medications such as antiplatelets (including aspirin), beta blockers, or nitroglycerin may be recommended. Procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) may be used in severe disease. In those with stable CAD it is unclear if PCI or CABG in addition to the other treatments improves life expectancy or decreases heart attack risk. In 2015 CAD affected 110 million people and resulted in 8.9 million deaths. It makes up 15.9% of all deaths making it the most common cause of death globally. The risk of death from CAD for a given age has decreased between 1980 and 2010, especially in developed countries. The number of cases of CAD for a given age has also decreased between 1990 and 2010. In the United States in 2010 about 20% of those over 65 had CAD, while it was present in 7% of those 45 to 64, and 1.3% of those 18 to 45. Rates are higher among men than women of a given age.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Bursa Province () is a province in Turkey, along the Sea of Marmara coast in northwestern Anatolia.

International automotive industry new model launches have been organised on Gotland Ring since 2007. Gotland Ring is considered the only sustainable race & test track in the world – hence the choice of a Pan-European launch of the hydrogen driven Honda FCX in June 2007. During October-Nov 2007, BMW premiered its new Efficient Dynamics technology in conjunction to its 135i Coupe introduction on Gotland Ring. In the future, six separate circuits - totalling 28 km - will allow flexible utilisation of the facility; simultaneous testing and corporate events can be executed on different parts of the extensive complex. Circuit experts and racing champions already consider the now existing operational Gotland Ring profile as one of the most demanding and exciting in the world. As of today, the tarmac extends over 3.2 km on the Northern Loop and it will be FIA graded and ready to be raced on by spring 2009. Modern FIA steel barriers are in place around the complete circuit and the track was certified for racing June 2009. The second complete entity – the Southern Loop – is under pre-construction development and is ready for tarmac installation during 2015.

In May 1963, 'Air Hawk' also became a daily strip and unlike most US adventure strips, the Sunday and daily continuity on 'Air Hawk' were separate stories with Dixon writing them both. By 1967 the strip was appearing not only in every Australian state, but also in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa, France, and both North and South America. Dixon continued the strip until 1986. Dixon was assisted over the years by Mike Tabrett, Hart Amos (March 1970 – June 1977), and Keith Chatto (1977-onwards). Chatto had previously ghosted the daily strip for a short period in 1972 before he took over drawing the Sunday version of the strip in the middle of 1977.

Dr Hal Mathews was a close friend of Jim Hawk who worked for the RFDS and Sister Janet Grant belonged to the Australian Inland Mission, whose medical clinic adjoined the air strip. In the mid-seventies, Jim Hawk was granted a franchise to supply a special Emergency Relief Unit. The Unit's function is to relieve any Flying Doctor base in need of assistance and to be available for special emergencies. Hal Mathews had been seconded to work with the Unit and Janet Grant was now his full-time assistant, with the change in responsibilities, the 'Doctors' part of the title was reverted to the singular.

First introduced in the 1950s, it is primarily effective for tremors such as those associated with Parkinson's disease, where a selected portion of the thalamus is surgically destroyed (ablated). Neurosurgeons use specialized equipment to precisely locate an area of the thalamus, usually choosing to work on only one side (the side opposite that of the worst tremors). Bilateral procedures are poorly tolerated because of increased complications and risk, including vision and speech problems. The positive effects on tremors are immediate. Other less destructive procedures are sometimes preferred, such as subthalamic deep brain stimulation, since this procedure can also improve tremors and other symptoms of PD.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Sara Ann Delano Roosevelt (September 21, 1854 – September 7, 1941) was the second wife of James Roosevelt I (from 1880), the mother of President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt, her only child, and subsequently the mother-in-law of Eleanor Roosevelt.

This tanager is a resident breeder from Honduras to Panama, South America south to Ecuador and southern Brazil, and on Trinidad. It occurs in forests and cocoa plantations. The bulky cup nest is built in low vegetation, and the female lays three brown-blotched cream eggs. White-shouldered tanagers are 14 cm long and weigh 14 g. They are long-tailed and with a mostly black stout pointed bill. The adult male is glossy black, apart from white underwing coverts and a conspicuous white shoulder patch. The shoulder patch is the most obvious difference from the similar but larger white-lined tanager, in which the smaller white area is rarely visible except in flight. Females and immatures have olive upperparts, yellow underparts and a grey head and neck. These are restless birds which eat mainly insects, including stick insects, but will occasionally take fruit. They often associate with other insectivorous birds in wandering feeding flocks.

It was first published by Brinkmann and Meringer in 1997. It has chromatic number 4, chromatic index 5, radius 3, diameter 3 and girth 5. It is also a 3-vertex-connected graph and a 3-edge-connected graph. It is the smallest 4-regular graph of girth 5 with chromatic number 4. It has book thickness 3 and queue number 2. By Brooks’ theorem, every k-regular graph (except for odd cycles and cliques) has chromatic number at most k. It was also known since 1959 that, for every k and l there exist k-chromatic graphs with girth l. In connection with these two results and several examples including the Chvátal graph, Branko Grünbaum conjectured in 1970 that for every k and l there exist k-chromatic k-regular graphs with girth l. The Chvátal graph solves the case k = l = 4 of this conjecture and the Brinkmann graph solves the case k = 4, l = 5. Grünbaum's conjecture was disproved for sufficiently large k by Johannsen, who showed that the chromatic number of a triangle-free graph is O(Δ/log Δ) where Δ is the maximum vertex degree and the O introduces big O notation. However, despite this disproof, it remains of interest to find examples and only very few are known. The chromatic polynomial of the Brinkmann graph is x 21 - 42x 20 + 861x 19 - 11480x 18 + 111881x 17 - 848708x 16 + 5207711x 15 - 26500254x 14 + 113675219x 13 - 415278052x 12 + 1299042255x 11 - 3483798283x 10 + 7987607279x 9 - 15547364853x 8 + 25384350310x 7 - 34133692383x 6 + 36783818141x 5 - 30480167403x 4 + 18168142566x 3 - 6896700738x 2 + 1242405972x .","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The is a DC electric multiple unit (EMU) train type that was operated on local services by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) in Japan from 1988 to 2017.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Mishukovo () is a rural locality (an inhabited locality) in Kolsky District of Murmansk Oblast, Russia, located beyond the Arctic Circle at a height of above sea level.

A leading figure in the Fiji Labour Party (FLP), she served from 1999 to 2006 as one of 8 Senators nominated by the Leader of the Opposition. Bain is known for her outspoken opinions. She called for the voting age (then 21) to be lowered, for the national flag bearing the British Union Jack to be changed, and for the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II to be removed from the national currency. In 2005 she said that after 18 years as a republic, Fiji should consider whether it was appropriate to retain the symbols of its colonial past. Bain had a tense relationship with fellow-Senator Ratu George Cakobau, one of 14 nominees of the Great Council of Chiefs. Parliamentary debates between the two sometimes turned acrimonious, with Cakobau questioning her right to speak on matters pertaining to indigenous Fijians on the grounds that she was not indigenous. (Bain was registered as a General Elector, an omnibus category including Caucasians, Chinese, and other minority groups). He attacked her for commenting on the Vola ni Kawa Bula (VKB, or Native Land Register), saying that only registered members of the VKB had the right to make comments on it. Indigenous landowners, however, defended her, saying that she was taking up their cause at their own request.

He composed it in Weimar for the Sunday Sexagesimae, the second Sunday before Lent, likely by 1713. The cantata is based on a text by Erdmann Neumeister published in 1711. While at Weimar Bach set at least one other cantata text by this librettist; he also set others by the court poet Salomon Franck. The text cites Isaiah, related to the gospel, the parable of the Sower. The third movement is in the style of a sermon, combined with a litany by Martin Luther. The closing chorale is the eighth stanza of Lazarus Spengler's hymn \"\".The cantata falls relatively early in Bach's chronology of cantata compositions. It was possibly composed for performance on 24 February 1715, but more likely for a year or even two earlier. Sexagesima always falls within January or February, so the title's reference to snowfall would have been relevant to the weather at the time. Bach structured the work in five movements, a sinfonia, a recitative, a recitative with chorale, an aria and a closing chorale. He scored it for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir only in the chorale, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble which is unusual in having violas but no violins. The instruments originally specified were four violas, cello, bassoon and basso continuo. When he performed the work again as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, he added two recorders to double viola I and II an octave higher, thus creating a lighter sound overall.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Aghla More () is a mountain in County Donegal, Ireland with a height of 584 metres.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Bertrade or Bertrada may refer to:","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The 3000 (formally the Laser 3000) is a racing sailing dinghy crewed by two persons with a trapeze for the crew. Launched in 1996 as the Laser 3000, the 3000 was developed from the Laser 2, using the original Frank Bethwaite-designed planing hull combined with a new designed self-draining deck by Derek Clark. Clark also re-designed the rig, using spars and sails from premium proprietary sources and replacing the symmetric spinnaker of the Laser 2 by a larger asymmetric spinnaker (gennaker). The gennaker is chute-launched and retrieved using a single halyard line, and is set on a retractable bowsprit. Helm balance and handling were improved using a shorter-footed mainsail with two full-width battens giving a larger roach. A mast with conventional spreaders replaced the now-unusual diamond arrangement of the Laser 2. The 3000 offers fast, exciting yet easy sailing, particularly for lighter sailors - couples, parent-child and teenage combinations are common at 3000 events. A modest rig size and forgiving nature means that if other classes are sailing on a windy day, any reasonably competently crewed 3000 will be able to join them and enjoy a sparkling sail. :The 3000 class organises racing for both the original boats built by Laser alongside boats sometimes tagged 'V3000' and currently built to the same design by VanderCraft. The latter are constructed from woven glass and epoxy resin using vacuum-bagging to produce a boat which is very stiff and light yet durable. The mast on current boats uses externally run rigging to enable their being sealed and thus buoyant, reducing any tendency for the boat to invert in a capsize. Other innovations introduced with the boats included a centrally mounted bowsprit, a compression-strut kicker or 'Gnav' in place of the conventional kicking strap or boom vang, and ‘off-the-boom’ sheeting with a take-off block at mid-boom fed from an aft bridle. The latter two rigging variations give considerably more room in the boat for the crew members, and remove any objections levelled at the original boats of being cramped due to their centre-bridle and conventional kicker. The class rules permit all variations introduced since the original Laser 3000 to be retro-fitted to existing boats, which can generally be done with minimal trouble or expense. While the original Hyde sails from Laser have proved to be still competitive, North Sails now offer an alternative using the latest cloth technology. North jibs are somewhat larger and require mounting right at the bow; a furlable Dacron jib is offered, as well as a Mylar jib which is battened and a little larger still. The boat is easy to sail singlehanded, optionally using the jib, gennaker and/or trapeze, the latter being easy to use thanks to the deck layout and lack of racks. Most boats are sailed two-up, however, and class events presently cater for this crew format. The class association organises open meetings, including a national championships and, recently, coaching days. The atmosphere at all these events is friendly, with lots of advice available for newcomers.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The World of Karl Pilkington is the first book written and illustrated by Karl Pilkington, and contains transcripts from The Ricky Gervais Show podcasts and excerpts from his own diary, as well as drawings and some original material illustrated by Pilkington himself.
