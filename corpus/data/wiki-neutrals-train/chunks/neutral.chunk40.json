The privacy laws in the United States include a non-public person's right to protection from publicity which puts the person in a false light to the public. That right is balanced against the First Amendment right of free speech. False light differs from defamation primarily in being intended \"to protect the plaintiff's mental or emotional well-being\", rather than to protect a plaintiff's reputation as is the case with the tort of defamation and in being about the impression created rather than being about veracity. If a publication of information is false, then a tort of defamation might have occurred. If that communication is not technically false but is still misleading, then a tort of false light might have occurred. False light privacy claims often arise under the same facts as defamation cases, and therefore not all states recognize false light actions. There is a subtle difference in the way courts view the legal theories—false light cases are about damage to a person's personal feelings or dignity, whereas defamation is about damage to a person's reputation. The specific elements of the tort of false light vary considerably, even among those jurisdictions which do recognize this Tort.

Racial segregation in professional baseball was sometimes called a gentlemen's agreement, meaning a tacit understanding, as there was no written policy at the highest level of organized baseball, the major leagues. But a high minor league's vote in 1887 against allowing new contracts with black players within its league sent a powerful signal that eventually led to the disappearance of blacks from the sport's other minor leagues later that century, including the low minors. After the line was in virtually full effect in the early 20th century, many black baseball clubs were established, especially during the 1920s to 1940s when there were several Negro Leagues. During this period some light-skinned Hispanic players, Native Americans, and native Hawaiians were able to play in the Major Leagues. The color line was broken for good when Jackie Robinson signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers organization for the 1946 season. In 1947, both Robinson in the National League and Larry Doby with the American League's Cleveland Indians appeared in games for their teams. By the late 1950s, the percentage of black players on Major League teams matched or exceeded that of the general population.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Floyd S.

The tradition may have originated with ceremonies when passing headlands, and become a \"folly\" sanctioned as a boost to morale, or have been created as a test for seasoned sailors to ensure their new shipmates were capable of handling long rough times at sea. Sailors who have already crossed the Equator are nicknamed Shellbacks, Trusty Shellbacks, Honorable Shellbacks, or Sons of Neptune. Those who have not crossed are nicknamed Pollywogs, or Slimy Pollywogs; in the Royal Canadian Navy they are nicknamed Tadpoles, or Dirty Tadpoles; an earlier nickname was griffins. Equator-crossing ceremonies, typically featuring King Neptune, are also sometimes carried out for passengers' entertainment on civilian ocean liners and cruise ships. They are also performed in the merchant navy and aboard sail training ships. The two-day event (evening and day) is a ritual in which previously inducted crew members (Trusty Shellbacks) aka Seamen of the U.S. Navy, who are organized into a \"Court of Neptune\", induct the Slimy Pollywogs into \"the mysteries of the Deep\". Physical hardship, in keeping with the spirit of the initiation, is tolerated, and each Pollywog is expected to endure a standard initiation rite in order to become a Shellback. Depending on the Ocean or Fleet AOR, there can be variations in the rite. Some rites have discussed a role reversal as follows, but this is not always a normal feature, and may be dependent on whether a small number of Shellbacks exist to conduct the initiation. The transition flows from established order to the controlled \"chaos\" of the Pollywog Revolt, the beginnings of re-order in the initiation rite as the fewer but experienced enlisted crew converts the Wogs through physical tests, then back to, and thereby affirming, the pre-established order of officers and enlisted. The eve of the equatorial crossing is called Wog Day and, as with many other night-before rituals, is a mild type of reversal of the day to come. Wogs—all of the uninitiated—are allowed to capture and interrogate any shellbacks they can find (e.g., tying them up, cracking eggs or pouring aftershave lotion on their heads). The wogs are made very aware that it will be much harder on them if they do anything like this. After crossing the line, Pollywogs receive subpoenas to appear before King Neptune and his court (usually including his first assistant Davy Jones and her Highness Amphitrite and often various dignitaries, who are all represented by the highest ranking seamen), who officiate at the ceremony, which is often preceded by a beauty contest of men dressing up as women, each department of the ship being required to introduce one contestant in swimsuit drag. Afterwards, some may be \"interrogated\" by King Neptune and his entourage, and the use of \"truth serum\" (hot sauce + after shave) and whole uncooked eggs put in the mouth. During the ceremony, the Pollywogs undergo a number of increasingly embarrassing ordeals (wearing clothing inside out and backwards; crawling on hands and knees on nonskid-coated decks; being swatted with short lengths of firehose; being locked in stocks and pillories and pelted with mushy fruit; being locked in a water coffin of salt-water and bright green sea dye (fluorescent sodium salt); crawling through chutes or large tubs of rotting garbage; kissing the Royal Baby's belly coated with axle grease, hair chopping, etc.), largely for the entertainment of the Shellbacks. Once the ceremony is complete, a Pollywog receives a certificate declaring his new status. Another rare status is the Golden Shellback, a person who has crossed the Equator at the 180th meridian (International Date Line). The rarest Shellback status is that of the Emerald Shellback (USA), or Royal Diamond Shellback (Commonwealth), which is received after crossing the Equator at the prime meridian, near the Null Island weather buoy. When a ship must cross the Equator reasonably close to one of these meridians, the ship's captain will typically plot a course across the Golden X so that the ship's crew can be initiated as Golden or Emerald/Royal Diamond Shellbacks. Colorado State University's Semester at Sea Program holds a line-crossing ceremony twice a year for its students when their vessel, the MV World Odyssey, crosses the equator. Line-crossing ceremonies are also carried out on many merchant ships.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Franklyn Seales (July 15, 1952 – May 14, 1990) was an American film, television and stage actor.

Chesterite is named after Chester, Vermont, where it was first described in 1977. The specific geologic setting within its origin is the Carleton talc quarry in Chester, Vermont. Chesterite has an orthorhombic crystal structure, which means it has three crystallographic axes of unequal length. All of the axes are perpendicular to each other. The stacking sequence for chesterite, which is found in micas, is very similar to orthopyroxenes and orthoamphiboles. Chesterite is an anisotropic mineral; therefore, it allows light to travel through it at different velocities when viewed at different angles. Chesterite is usually found in thin sheets within ultramafic rocks. A polytype of chesterite could be anthophyllite, which has a similar crystal structure. Chesterite is used for research on stacking formations and symmetry point groups that could be possible polymorphs or polysomes of the amphibole-anthophyllite groups. Chesterite has no direct usage, but some geologists or scientists generally classify it under the amphibole-anthophyllite group.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Anomoeotes instabilis is a species of moth of the Anomoeotidae family.

He is the 'senher d'Alest' (the lord of Alès) referred to as a participant in the torneyamen \"Senhe n'Enric, us reys un ric avar\" along with his brother-in-law Henry and the troubadour Guiraut Riquier. Peire was descended from a Raymond Pelet who took part in the First Crusade. His father was Bernard Pelet, who died in September 1252, leaving his entire heritage to his eldest son, William, under the tutelage of Bernard de Barre, Guillaume de Pontils, and Jean de Bossoles. In 1253 William, with his tutors and his younger brothers, including Peire, received the homage of their father's vassals: Hugues de Melet, Pierre de Spinasson, and many others, in the presence of Pierre Gaucelin, Bérenger de la Fare, Arnaud d'Arsac, and Pierre Gaucelin de Follaquier. On the death of William without heirs Peire succeeded him. He married Delfina sometime before April 1276, when her brother released a sum of money left her by their father, Henry I: a hundred marks of silver or 5,000 sols tournois. In 1274 James I of Aragon renounced the homage and oath of fealty owed by Peire for his fief since his great-great-grandfather, Bertrand Pelet, Count of Melgueil, had rendered it to James's grandfather, Alfonso II. Peire then began a war with Bérenger de Frédol, Bishop of Maguelonne, over the county of Melgueil, which at that time was held by the bishop from the Papacy. In 1276 the combatants were brought before the episcopal court of the Archdiocese of Narbonne. Peire lost the case and was ordered to pay 1,000 livres in compensation. Joseph Angalde placed the aforementioned torneyamen around 1280&ndash;1, before the death of Peire, which he believed occurred in 1282; after the return of Riquier from Castile in 1279; and after the succession of Henry, who he believed was referred to as coms (count) in the torneyamen, in 1274. This dating has been revised in light of Anglade's errors (Peire died in 1303 and Henry is referred to only as senher, lord). Since all three debaters call on the adjudication of the ''coms d'Astarac, probably Bernard IV, it seems probable that the torneyamen'' dates to 1281&ndash;4, the period during which Riquier is known to have addressed several songs to the count of Astarac.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Klenčí pod Čerchovem (until 1946 Kleneč pod Čerchovem, ) is a market town (městys) in Domažlice District in the Plzeň Region of the Czech Republic.

By limiting deposit interest, Regulation Q prevented banks from competing with rising money market funds (MMF's) that were relatively unregulated and thus able to provide higher returns by investing client funds directly in unsecured commercial paper and repurchase agreements.

Ching. It was so named because many businessmen were anticipating Hawaii's eventual attainment of statehood, however no one realized then that Alaska would actually gain that distinction, and Hawaii would end up as the 50th State. Ching wanted to manufacture Hawaiian records to answer the demand for music in his downtown Honolulu record store. To guarantee authenticity in the recording performances, Ching enlisted with Hawaiian composer and musician Johnny Almeida, known as the \"Dean of Hawaiian Music\" as the label's musical director. The first 49th State recordings were made using an acetate record cutting machine, in a make shift sstudio at Ching's own home. When the technology became available, a tape recorder was used recording first on paper tapes and then later on plastic. The original recordings were released first on 78 rpm records. It was a successor to Bell Records (1940), Honolulu which released Hawaiian music recordings between 1944 and 1950 The company has been described as \"the first, top, most significant, authentic label of Hawaii\" Ching made recordings in his home using a \"portable disc-cutter\".

Tar paper is made by impregnating paper or fiberglass mat with tar, producing a waterproof material useful for roof construction. Tar paper is distinguished from roofing felt which is impregnated with asphalt instead of tar; but these two products are used the same way, and their names sometimes are used informally as synonyms. Tar paper has been in use for centuries. Originally felt was made from recycled rags but today felts are made of recycled paper products (typically cardboard) and sawdust. The most common product is #15 felt. Before the oil crisis, felt weighed about 15 pounds per square (one square = 100 square feet) and hence the asphalt-impregnated felt was called \"15#\" and \"15-pound felt\". Modern, inorganic mats no longer weigh 0.73 kg/m2, and to reflect this fact the new felts are called \"#15\". In fact, #15 mats can weigh from 7.5 to 12.5 pounds/sq depending on the manufacturer and the standard to which felt is made (i.e., CGSB, ASTM D227 Standard Specification for Coal-tar saturated Organic Felt Used in Roofing and Waterproofing, ASTM D4990, Standard Specification for Coal Tar Glass Felt Used in Roofing and Waterproofing, or none). Thirty-pound (30#) felt is now #30 felt, and usually weighs 16 to 27 pounds per square. Tar paper is more accurately a Grade D building paper (the Grade D designation derives from a federal specification in the United States), which is widely used in the West. Building paper is manufactured from virgin kraft paper, unlike felts, and then impregnated with asphalt. The longer fibres in the kraft paper allow for a lighter weight product with similar and often better mechanical properties than felt. Grade papers are rated in minutes—the amount of time it takes for a moisture sensitive chemical indicator to change colour when a small boat-like sample is floated on water. Common grades include 10, 20, 30, and 60 minute. The higher the rating the more moisture resistant and the heavier. A typical 20 minute paper will weigh about 3.3 lbs per square, a 30-minute paper 3.75, and a 60-minute paper about six. The smaller volume of material however does tend to make these papers less resistant to moisture than heavier felts.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The 1913-14 season in Swedish football, starting August 1913 and ending July 1914:","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"William Fuller (1608–1675) was an English churchman.

It was particularly known as the first building specifically for clown shows, although even in its early days it was also used for a range of other events. On November 8, 1944, with most of Munich's beer halls wrecked by Allied bombing, the last commemoration of the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch was held at the Circus Krone Building, with Heinrich Himmler standing in for Adolf Hitler. On December 21, 1944, it too was destroyed by bombing attacks. In 1950, it was re-constructed as a circus building with a seating capacity of 3,000 spectators. The main arena has acted as a concert venue, hosting artists, like The Beatles and The Who, in the 1960s and KISS, Kate Bush, Frank Zappa and AC/DC in the 1970s (AC/DC also performed there once in 2003). Also, the Rolling Stones performed and were recorded there on Sunday, 8 June 2003. It was seen on German television every year as the setting for the annual Stars in der Manege charity show, in which celebrities from fields such as music, television and sport perform classic circus acts in conjunction with circus professionals. On June 14, 1980, Devo performed at the venue during their Freedom of Choice tour.

It is most commonly employed in quantum mechanical simulations of electronic band structure in solids. The approximation was proposed by John C. Slater. Augmented plane wave method is a method which uses muffin-tin approximation. It is a method to approximate the energy states of an electron in a crystal lattice. The basic approximation lies in the potential in which the potential is assumed to be spherically symmetric in the muffin-tin region and constant in the interstitial region. Wave functions (the augmented plane waves) are constructed by matching solutions of the Schrödinger equation within each sphere with plane-wave solutions in the interstitial region, and linear combinations of these wave functions are then determined by the variational method . Many modern electronic structure methods employ the approximation. Among them are the augmented plane wave (APW) method, the linear muffin-tin orbital method (LMTO) and various Green's function methods. One application is found in the variational theory developed by Korringa (1947) and by Kohn and Rostoker (1954) referred to as the KKR method. This method has been adapted to treat random materials as well, where it is called the KKR coherent potential approximation. In its simplest form, non-overlapping spheres are centered on the atomic positions. Within these regions, the screened potential experienced by an electron is approximated to be spherically symmetric about the given nucleus. In the remaining interstitial region, the potential is approximated as a constant. Continuity of the potential between the atom-centered spheres and interstitial region is enforced. In the interstitial region of constant potential, the single electron wave functions can be expanded in terms of plane waves. In the atom-centered regions, the wave functions can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics and the eigenfunctions of a radial Schrödinger equation. Such use of functions other than plane waves as basis functions is termed the augmented plane-wave approach (of which there are many variations). It allows for an efficient representation of single-particle wave functions in the vicinity of the atomic cores where they can vary rapidly (and where plane waves would be a poor choice on convergence grounds in the absence of a pseudopotential).","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Osówiec Szlachecki is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Przasnysz, within Przasnysz County, Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central Poland.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Burning Valley is a 1953 coming-of-age novel by the American writer Phillip Bonosky set in the steel valley of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania during the 1920s.

His name is bound up with the first Italian constitution, the Albertine Statute, and with the First Italian War of Independence (1848–1849). During the Napoleonic period, he resided in France, where he received a liberal education. As Prince of Carignano in 1821, he granted and then withdrew his support for a rebellion which sought to force Victor Emmanuel I to institute a constitutional monarchy. He became a conservative and participated in the legitimist expedition against the Spanish liberals in 1823. He became king of Sardinia in 1831 on the death of his distant cousin Charles Felix, who had no heir. As king, after an initial conservative period during which he supported various European legitimist movements, he adopted the idea of a federal Italy, led by the Pope and freed from the House of Habsburg in 1848. In the same year he granted the Albertine Statute, the first Italian constitution, which remained in force until 1947. Charles Albert led his forces against the Imperial Austrian army in the First Italian War of Independence (1848–1849), but was abandoned by Pope Pius IX and Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies and was defeated in 1849 at the Battle of Novara, after which he abdicated in favour of his son, Victor Emmanuel II. Charles Albert died in exile a few months later in the Portuguese city of Porto. The attempt to free northern Italy from Austria represents the first attempt of the House of Savoy to alter the equilibrium established in the Italian peninsula after the Congress of Vienna. These efforts were continued successfully by Victor Emmanuel II, who became the first king of a unified Italy in 1861. Charles Albert received a number of nicknames, including \"the Italian Hamlet\" (given to him by Giosuè Carducci on account of his gloomy, hesitant and enigmatic character) and \"the Hesitant King\" (Re Tentenna) because he hesitated for a long time between the establishment of a constitutional monarchy and the reinforcement of absolute rule.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"'''Queens' College''' is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge, England.

This meant that another free election was necessary, as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was left without a monarch. One of the candidates for the Polish throne was the Duke of Oława (Lower Silesia) and son of the late king, James Louis Sobieski. He was initially supported by the Kingdom of France and the Swedish Empire. Also, among his followers were szlachta from Greater Poland, Lesser Poland, and Bishop of Kujawy, Stanisław Dąmbski. James Louis Sobieski, however, did not get along with his French-born mother, Marie Casimire Louise de La Grange d'Arquien. The mother and her son argued about properties of John III Sobieski, and as a result, James Louis lost the support of Polish nobility. Another candidate, the Elector of Saxony Augustus II the Strong, was backed by influential and powerful Emperor Leopold I. To win the support of Roman Catholic, conservative Poles, Augustus decided to convert from Lutheranism to Catholicism. The conversion took place in Vienna, on June 2, 1697, and this decision won for Frederick the support of Pope Innocent XII. The main opponent to the Saxon elector was Francois Louis, Prince of Conti, backed by King Louis XIV of France. His candidacy won support of several Polish and Lithuanian magnates, many of whom were bribed by French envoy, Melchior de Polignac. On October 24, 1696, Primate of Poland Michał Stefan Radziejowski, who had previously backed James Louis Sobieski, switched sides and declared his support of Francois Louis. Since Radziejowski at that time was the interrex, his decision attracted the nobility, which followed him. Nevertheless, key role in the oncoming election was played by the Tsardom of Russia, which was Polish ally in the ongoing war against the Ottoman Empire (see Great Turkish War). The Russians backed Augustus, who had previously declared that he would continue the war, and who had in 1695-1696 commanded Austrian - Saxon army in its Hungarian campaign. The election of Francois Louis meant quick end to the Polish-Ottoman war, and possibility of a Polish-Russian conflict. The Russians, well aware of this danger, sent large sums of money to the Commonwealth, trying to win the support of Polish-Lithuanian nobility. The election took place in Wola near Warsaw, on June 27, 1697. By popular support, Francois Louis, Prince of Conti was elected new King of the Commonwealth. This was immediately contested by Augustus the Strong, who declared himself the new monarch. Third candidate, James Louis Sobieski, expressed his support of Conti. On July 27, 1697, Augustus, backed by Russia, Austria and Brandenburg-Prussia, crossed Polish border near Czeladź in Lesser Poland. He marched towards Kraków, but was not allowed to enter the ancient capital, as the Starosta of Kraków, Franciszek Wielopolski, himself a supporter of Conti, did not let him into the city. The stalemate was quickly solved after Wielopolski had accepted a bribe, but soon another problem appeared. According to the Polish law, the coronation in Wawel Cathedral was to be carried out only with royal insignia, kept in Wawel Treasury. There were eight locks in the door to the Treasury, with eight keys. The keys were kept by eight Senators, out of which six supported Conti. Augustus II and his entourage decided to make a hole in the Treasury wall, leaving the door intact. On September 15, 1697, Augustus signed the Pacta Conventa, and was crowned new King of Poland, August II, by Bishop of Kujawy, Stanisław Dąmbski. Primate Radziejowski refused to recognize the coronation, stating that Conti was the rightful monarch. Radziejowski started the so-called Łowicz Rokosz, which gathered supporters of the Frenchman. Conti himself arrived at the Baltic Sea port of Gdańsk on September 26, 1697, with a squadron of six ships commanded by Jean Bart. Since Russia concentrated its army near Lithuanian border, a possibility of an international conflict was real. The situation was solved without foreign intervention, as on November 9, the attack of troops loyal to Augustus forced Conti to abandon his quarters in Oliwa, and to leave Poland. On December 12, 1697, Conti returned to France. Primate Radziejowski refused to recognize Augustus until spring of 1698, when he received a large sum of money, and was promised a government post.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The 2014 Web.com Tour was the 25th season of the top developmental tour for the U.S. PGA Tour in men's golf, and the third under the current sponsored name of Web.com Tour.

The marriage was not successful and she became a virtual prisoner at the de Pontalba chateau near Senlis. Having failed, despite his concerted efforts over more than two decades, to gain possession of Micaela's entire inheritance, her father-in-law, Baron de Pontalba, eventually shot her four times at point-blank range with a pair of dueling pistols, and then committed suicide.

The main use of chordioids is to form \"legitimate\" chords enharmonically in 12TET by adding one or more notes to this base. It is typical of chordioids that many different resultant chords can be created from the same base depending on the note or combination of notes added. The resultant chords on a single chordioid are somewhat related, because they can be progressed between using motion of just one voice. Theorists – or practical music teachers – writing of chordioids usually go so far as to advise that students learn them in the practical manner of chords generally: in all transpositions, ranges, permutations, and voicings, for reading, writing, and playing. It is the case, also, that \"legitimate chords\" can be used as chordioids to create resultant chords by the same process. Perhaps this is whence the non-chord chordioids come. The Italian augmented 6th chord (It+6) is one example, from which proceed the French augmented 6th chord (Fr+6) and German augmented 6th chord (Gr+6) by addition of one note. Rawlins(2005) asserts that the notion derives from practice of such composers as Eric Satie, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Gabriel Faure, and was first used in jazz by Bill Evans. Two chordioids may potentially be combined, as well. Typically, duplication of notes will result in a reduced number of unique notes in the resultant. Chordioids as a technique is related to polychords insofar as polychords are the result of an additive process, but differs in that the basis of polychords is the addition of two known chords. Chordioids is related also to upper structures as a technique insofar as upper structures represent groups of notes not commonly taken to be \"legitimate\" chords, but differs in that chordioids as a technique uses a priori structures held in common rather than a free selection of color tones appropriate for a lower integral chord.

Generation is carried out by multiple companies both state-owned and private. Distribution is controlled by Electric Networks of Armenia (ENA), High Voltage Electrical Networks (HVEN CJSC), and Electro Power System Operator. There are over 36,000 km of distribution lines across Armenia. As of 2016, the majority of the electricity sector is privatized and foreign-owned (by both Russian and American companies), which is the result of a law passed in 1998 that allowed for the privatization of electricity generation and distribution in the country. Administration, government legislation, and policy of the sector is conducted by the [[Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources of the Republic of Armenia]]. Regulation of the sector is performed by the Public Services Regulatory Commission of the Republic of Armenia. Armenia does not have any fossil-fuel reserves, so it relies on gas imports from Russia and Iran, and nuclear fuel imports from Russia, which, together, result in approximately 66% of electricity production. Armenia is a net-producer of electricity and has exported in excess of 1.3 billion kWh per year since 2014 to Iran, Georgia, and Artsakh. Large investments have been made in the electricity sector in Armenia in 2000's. These include the construction of the $247M combined-cycle Yerevan Thermal Power Plant completed in 2010, a $52M loan from the World Bank in 2015 to improve the reliability of electricity distribution across Armenia,   and a $42M investment in 2016 by Electric Networks of Armenia to repair distribution networks. In June 2016, the Armenian Parliament updated the law “On Energy Saving and Renewable Energy” which encourages the use of solar power in the country and allows users of solar installations of 150 kW or less to sell their excess energy back to the electrical grid. The voltage in Armenia is 220 V AC at a frequency of 50 Hz. Armenia uses the European 2-pin C-socket and F-socket plugs.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Théodore Gouvy International Festival (Festival international Théodore Gouvy) is an annual festival of classical music held in honour of Franco-German composer, Théodore Gouvy, organised in Hombourg-Haut, the area where the composer, from 1867 onwards, used to spend the summer with his family.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Algeria is scheduled to compete at the 2017 World Aquatics Championships in Budapest, Hungary from 14 July to 30 July.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Enchi College of Education is a teacher education college in Enchi (Aowin District District, Western Region, Ghana).

The game is the thematic successor to Theme Park, also produced by Bullfrog, and the second instalment in their Theme series, and part of their Designer Series. The game is noted for its humour, and contains numerous references to pop culture. Peter Molyneux and James Leach came up with the idea of creating a Theme game based on a hospital, but Molyneux was not directly involved in development due to his work on Dungeon Keeper. Designers originally planned to include four distinct gameplay modes corresponding to historical time periods, but this was dropped due to time pressures on the team. Multiplayer support with up to four players was added in a patch. The game received a generally positive reception, with reviewers praising the graphics and humour in particular. Theme Hospital was a commercial success, selling over 4 million copies worldwide, and was ported to the PlayStation in 1998. A Sega Saturn version was in development, but cancelled. The game was re-released on GOG.com in 2012 and Origin in 2015, and the PlayStation version was released on the PlayStation Network in Europe in 2008, Japan in 2009, and North America in 2010.
