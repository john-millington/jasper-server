In all provinces and territories except Quebec, these plans are administered by Employment and Social Development Canada, while Quebec administers them separately with the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP). Upon retiring, a contributor receives regular CPP pension payments equal to 25% of the earnings on which CPP contributions were made over the entire working life of a contributor from age 18 in constant dollars. Adjustments are made according to the Consumer Price Index. Although one can claim a CPP pension at age 60 rather than the typical retirement age of 65, as of 2016, those who claim it at 60 have their pension reduced by 36%. Canada also maintains the Registered Retirement Savings Plan, which maintains personal accounts for holding savings and investment assets.

The present-day city of Natchez, Mississippi, developed at this site. As part of the peace terms that ended the Natchez War of 1716, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville required the Natchez to build the fort by providing materials and labor. Sited close to the main Natchez settlement, called the Grand Village of the Natchez, Fort Rosalie served as the primary French stronghold and trading post among the Natchez. French settlements and tobacco plantations were established in Natchez territory, with the fort serving as the local seat of colonial government. Growing tension between the French and the Natchez erupted into violence several times during the 1720s, culminating in a massive Natchez attack on November 29, 1729. They destroyed the entire French settlement, killing nearly all the men and taking hundreds of women and children captive. The Natchez seized and occupied Fort Rosalie. Retaliation by the French and allied Choctaw forces in 1730 forced the Natchez to evacuate, leaving the fort in ruins. By 1731 the French, with their more numerous Indian allies, had killed, captured, or dispersed most of the Natchez, and they ceased to exist as a tribe. The French sold surviving Natchez into slavery, many destined for French plantations in the Caribbean. Some escaped and found refuge among the Chickasaw, Creek, and Cherokee of the region. The French rebuilt Fort Rosalie in the early 1730s. Following the Treaty of Paris in 1763 after the British won the Seven Years' War, the French ceded the fort and part of present-day Louisiana to British control (with New Orleans and the land west of the Mississippi River going to Spain). The British renamed the outpost Fort Panmure. During the American Revolutionary War, Spain declared war against Great Britain and took control of the fort, holding it from 1779 to 1798. After 1798, the United States took over, establishing the Mississippi Territory with Natchez as its first territorial capital. The U.S. abandoned the fort in 1804.

Traditionally, Awori are found in two Nigerian States: Ogun and Lagos. The Awori people migrated from Ile Ife and occupied the present day Lagos state. Post-colonial creation of States and local governments influenced the splitting of the homogenous people into the present Ogun and Lagos States in South-western Nigeria. Awori towns in Ogun State are Otta, Igbesa, Ilobi and Tigbo. The settlement of the Awori clan preceded the establishment of Abeokuta as an Egba kingdom in 1830. Otta, the foremost Awori town within present day Ogun State, which is also the State’s industrial nerve-centre, for instance, was already in existence in the 15th century. The first crowned Oba at Ota was Oba Akinsewa Ogbolu in 1621, while the first Alake in Abeokuta, Sagbua Okekenu was crowned on 8 August 1854. The Awori are direct descendants of Olofin, one of the sons of Oduduwa - the father of the Yoruba nation. As such, in accordance with Yoruba custom, they brought their crown along with them from Ile Ife. Traditions are consistent about the presence of a distinct Yoruba sub-group around Lagos by C1550 when the Benin invaded the region of Lagos. The traditional territory of the Awori extends from latitude 60 30’ N from the extreme east and a landmass along the coast is over 350,000 hectares (3,500 km2) with less than twenty percent made up of lagoons, creeks and coastal estuaries. The name Awori has come to be associated with a dialect group of Yoruba speaking people who had long occupied the south-western part of the coastal area of Yorubaland in Nigeria. This name according to oral sources, was derived from the legend of a floating ritual dish which Ogunfunminire (their progenitor) allegedly followed from Ile-Ife down to Isheri. It was the disappearance (sinking) of the dish that suggested settlement in the region as earlier prophesied by the Ifa oracle. Thus, the group took its name from Awori (the pot sinks). The Awori as a sub-group possesses a distinguished speech. An anthropologist, W.G. Wormalin in his Intelligence Report on the Badagry district of the colony (1935) gives a graphic description of the early Awori when he writes that: They speak low and slurred dialect of the Yoruba language. They mostly engage in farming and fishing. Their lack of figure and unity seems to have combined with the unfavourable nature of their habitat to render them a ‘poor’ lot from the breeding point of view with the exception of those of them within the region of Lagos from earliest time to date The Awori constitute the bulk of the indigenous population of seventeen, out of the twenty local government areas of Lagos State as at the year 2003, the only exceptions being Epe, Ikorodu and IbejuLekki with minimal Awori inhabitants. In these areas, they have developed many kingdoms and chiefdoms. The Awori could be grouped into two major divisions. These are the early Awori and the latter Awori groups. Among the early Awori group of settlement are Isheri, Otto-Olofin, Iddo, Ebute Metta, Apa, Ibereko as well as Otta and Ado-Odo in Ogun state of Nigeria. A common feature of these settlements is that they were founded before 1500. They also have a related migratory history and recognise Ogunfunminire as their progenitor. The later settlement include Ojo, Itire, Mushin, Iba, Otto-Awori, Ijanikin, Ilogbo Elegba, Ilogbo-Eremi, Iworo, Agbara, Ilashe etc. all of which are post 1500 settlements. The Awori whose ancestral home is Isheri-Olofin were in Lagos before the Benin invasion as propounded by the Olofin Adimula of Orile Isheri and supported by other Awori groups such as Apa, Ilogbo-Eremi, Ibereko, Oto, Ota, Ado-Odo and Igbesa. Post-independence political creation of States however saw the dispersal of the homogenous clan scattered around the present Ogun and Lagos State. Journey From Ile-Ife Olofin and his followers left the palace of Oduduwa in Ile-Ife and migrated southward along a river. Oduduwa had given Olofin a mud plate and instructed him to place it on the water and follow it until it sank into the river. The plate is said to have stopped at various locations and finally sank at Idumota in the present day Lagos State in Nigeria. As they were to settle wherever it sank, the people were filled with joy when this finally happened. The name AWORI, translates as \"The plate sank\". It was adopted as the clan’s name till today. Several days after leaving Ile-Ife, the plate suddenly stopped near Olokemeji, near the present day Abeokuta. After seventeen days, it began moving again, only to stop at Oke Ata, for another seventeen days. At the end of seventeen days, the plate began moving again, only to stop again on the southern outskirts of present-day Abeokuta, where it stayed for another seventeen days. At this location, some of Olofin's followers decided to remain, led by a man named OshoAro-bi-ologbo-egan. The plate continued downriver, stopping again at Isheri, where it remained for a much longer period of time. Olofin began instructing his followers to begin setting up a permanent settlement, but after 289 days (17 x 17) the plate began moving again. Olofin and a few followers followed the plate, while the rest of the group stayed behind. After two days the plate stopped briefly at Iddo in the present day Lagos. At Idumota, a few kilometres away in the present day central Lagos, it whirled around in the water and sank to the bottom. When Olofin returned to his group at Iddo, they are said to have asked him where the plate was. He answered \"Awo Ti Ri\" meaning \"The plate has sunk\". This is how the name Awori is said to have come into being. The Aworis are a peace-loving, accommodating and friendly clan.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Kučići may refer to the following places in Bosnia and Herzegovina:","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Emma Grigsby Meharg (August 14, 1873 - September 4, 1937) was the first female Secretary of State of Texas, serving from 1925 to 1927 under Governor Miriam A.

The tests often include stopping with the front and rear wheels straddling a line, and always end stopping in a garage (usually marked out with cones). Sections of each test are usually completed in reverse. Cars involved can be standard road cars or ones specially built for autotest. In either case, the sport is cheap, with entries to events usually costing between £8 and £25. Autotests can take place on either grass or hard surface. Grass Autotests are popular for club events as they are more gentle on tires and transmissions. Many Clubs run their Grass autotests without any reversing. Championship Autotests in the UK are normally on a hard surface. Each event consists of between three and six tests, with each test completed twice with the faster of the two counting for the results. The tests are timed with a stopwatch, with penalties of 10 seconds given for each cone hit. A wrong turn in a test results in a maximum time, which is usually 30 seconds slower than the fastest time in class. The winner is the driver who completes the tests in the shortest time (including penalties). Each test usually takes around a minute to complete, and often turns into a test of memory as well as driver skill. Most of the autotest layouts are symmetrical and the drivers do get the chance to walk the course. Autotests are conducted in the UK and Ireland and are similar to Motorkhana in Australia and New Zealand. Cars compete one at a time and speeds are low so safety is high. Autotesting is also a little similar to autocrossing in the USA, but the slower speeds, frequent handbrake turns and reversing are all major points of difference.

They were generally owned staying in families for generations, although some were rented. Each was enclosed by either a wall or hedge, complete with lockable gate to ensure privacy. Many of them had summer houses built so the family could spend the entire day in the garden, whatever the weather. They fell into disuse in the 20th century with only one or two remaining in use after WWII. In the 1950s the local council (Warwick District Council) started buying up the plots with a plan to re-develop the hillside and in the 1960s it was designated for social housing. Planning permission was granted in the 1980s and then subsequently lapsed although some building was completed.

In late 1853, George Alonzo Johnson with his partner Hartshorne and a new partner Captain Alfred H. Wilcox, formed George A. Johnson & Company and obtained the contract from the U. S. Army to supply the remote post of Fort Yuma. Johnson and his partners all having learned a lesson from their previous failed attempts ascending the Colorado, and with the example of the earlier steamboat Uncle Sam, brought the parts of a more powerful side-wheel steamboat, the General Jesup, with them to the mouth of the Colorado from San Francisco. The General Jesup was 104 feet long with a 17-foot beam, 27 feet with its paddle guards, and drew 30 inches of water. There it was reassembled and launched at a landing in the upper tidewater of the river and reached Fort Yuma, January 18, 1854. This new boat with a 50-horsepower steam engine, capable of carrying 50 tons of cargo unloaded in the estuary up river against the strong current of the Colorado River, was very successful making round trips from the estuary to the fort in only four or five days. Costs of transport of goods to the fort were cut from $500 per ton or more to only $75 per ton. Another reason for the speed of the new steamboat beside its powerful engine was the establishment of the wood-yards along the river between the delta and Fort Yuma. The landings were organized by Johnson to supply wood for the steamboats, so the crew would not need to gather wood as they proceeded up river, as the crew of the Uncle Sam had been obliged to do. These landings were each located at about the distance a steamboat could travel up and down river each day on that section of river. Steamboats did not travel at night, due to the danger of running onto sandbars or into snags on the ever-changing river. The boats would be refueled at the landings while tied up overnight. The wood-yards were owned by Yankee's, who hired the Cocopah from local rancherias, to cut the wood (usually cottonwood or mesquite), transport it to the wood-yards and load it onto the boats. Cocopah men often also served as deck hands on the steamboats. In 1857, George A. Johnson decided to conduct his own expedition up river at his own expense with the General Jesup. The War Department concerned about deteriorating relations with the Mormons in Utah wanted to investigate the possibility of bringing troops into Utah by steamboat up the Colorado River. Fort Yuma's commander provided rations, a mountain howitzer and a detachment of 15 soldiers. With the soldiers and 15 armed civilians Johnson set off from the fort on December 31. The large crew aided in gathering wood for fuel along the way, and twenty one days later, Johnson's party had reached the first rapids in Pyramid Canyon, over 300 miles above Fort Yuma and 8 miles above the modern site of Davis Dam. Running low on food he turned back after viewing the river ahead continuing another 40 miles and believed he had proved the river could be navigated as far as the Virgin River which he believed to be only 75 miles away. During the 1858-59 Mohave War the General Jesup and the larger and newer stern-wheeler Colorado where engaged to carry troops and supplies up river for the Mohave Expeditions at $500 per day, and thereafter contracted to support the army posts of Camp Gaston and Camp Mohave, later Fort Mohave. After five years on the Colorado, the now worn out General Jesup was dismantled in 1859. It was replaced by the larger more powerful Cocopah, a stern-wheel steamboat drawing only 19 inches of water, which was better suited to navigating the hazards of the upper Colorado route.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Rabbi Eliyahu Leon Levi (Hebrew: אליהו ליאון לוי), also called Baba Leon, (1939 – July 20, 2015) was a well-known Rabbi and Kabbalist, author of the prayer \"Tikun-Yesod Yeshuat-Eliyahu\".","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Nicola Shulman, Marchioness of Normanby is a British biographer, former model, and aristocrat.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Browar Koszalin is a brewery in Koszalin, Poland that is located in a Neo-Gothic building, built in the second half of the nineteenth century, that brews BROK beer.

In 1873, when the Baiturrahman Grand Mosque was burned by the Dutch, all the worshipers held a Friday prayer at Ulee Lheue. Since then the name of the mosque became Baiturrahim Mosque. Since its establishment, the mosque has been restored several times. Initially the building was completely made out of wood, with a simple shape and was located next to the location of the present mosque. Because it was made out of wood, building did not last long as weathering had torn the building down. In 1922 the mosque was re-built with long-lasting material by the Government of Dutch East Indies with European architectural style. But this construction did not use iron or bone braces, and built with bricks and cement only. In 1983, Banda Aceh was rocked by a devastating earthquake and it undermined the dome of the mosque. After that people rebuilt the mosque but they no longer installed the dome, thus replacing it with an ordinary roof. Ten years later, a massive renovation of the mosque was commenced, leaving the front part the only original part of the building. 60 percents of the remaining parts were renovated. Until today, the original part of the mosque still looks solid on the front. On December 26, 2004, an earthquake and subsequent tsunami leveled the entire buildings around the mosque, thus made Baiturrahim Mosque the only surviving structure in the area.

CcpA interacts with the phosphorylated form of Hpr and Crh, which is formed when high concentrations of glucose or fructose-1,6-bisphosphate are present in the cell. Interaction of Hpr or Crh modulates the DNA sequence specificity of CcpA, allowing it to bind operator DNA to modulate transcription.

The administrative county was formed in 1974, incorporating most of the historic county of Huntingdonshire. Local government is divided between Cambridgeshire County Council and Peterborough City Council, which is a separate unitary authority. Under the county council, there are five district councils, Cambridge City Council, South Cambridgeshire District Council, East Cambridgeshire District Council, Huntingdonshire District Council and Fenland District Council. Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) are designated by local authorities, which must have a legal control over the site, by owning or leasing it or having an agreement with the owner. LNRs are sites which have a special local interest either biologically, geologically or education. Local authorities can either manage sites themselves or through other groups such as \"friends of\" and wildlife trusts, and can apply local bye-laws to manage and protect LNRs. There are twenty-seven LNRs in Cambridgeshire. Four are Sites of Special Scientific Interest, and five are managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire. The largest is Little Paxton Pits at sixty hectares, which is of national importance for wintering wildfowl, and the smallest is St Denis Churchyard, East Hatley, which has grassland with diverse flowers. There is public access to all sites.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The 2009–10 Karnataka State Film Awards, presented by Government of Karnataka, to felicitate the best of Kannada Cinema released in the year 2009.

Almost nothing is known about Edmund. He is thought to have been of East Anglian origin and was first mentioned in an annal of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, written some years after his death. The kingdom of East Anglia was devastated by the Vikings, who destroyed any contemporary evidence of his reign. Later writers produced fictitious accounts of his life, asserting that he was born in 841, the son of Æthelweard, an obscure East Anglian king, whom it was said Edmund succeeded when he was fourteen (or alternatively that he was the youngest son of a Germanic king named Alcmund). Later versions of Edmund's life relate that he was crowned on 25 December 855 at Burna (probably Bures St. Mary in Suffolk), which at that time functioned as the royal capital, and that he became a model king. In 869, the Great Heathen Army advanced on East Anglia and killed Edmund. He may have been slain by the Danes in battle, but by tradition he met his death at an unidentified place known as Haegelisdun, after he refused the Danes' demand that he renounce Christ: the Danes beat him, shot him with arrows and then beheaded him, on the orders of Ivar the Boneless and his brother Ubba. According to one legend, his head was then thrown into the forest, but was found safe by searchers after following the cries of an ethereal wolf that was calling, in Latin, \"Hic, Hic, Hic\" – \"Here, Here, Here\". Commentators have noted how Edmund's death bears resemblance to the fate suffered by St Sebastian, St Denis and St Mary of Egypt. A coinage commemorating Edmund was minted from around the time East Anglia was absorbed by the kingdom of Wessex and a popular cult emerged. In about 986, Abbo of Fleury wrote of his life and martyrdom. The saint's remains were temporarily moved from Bury St Edmunds to London for safekeeping in 1010. His shrine at Bury was visited by many kings, including Canute, who was responsible for rebuilding the abbey: the stone church was rebuilt again in 1095. During the Middle Ages, when Edmund was regarded as the patron saint of England, Bury and its magnificent abbey grew wealthy, but during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, his shrine was destroyed. Medieval manuscripts and works of art relating to Edmund include Abbo's Passio Sancti Eadmundi, John Lydgate's 14th-century Life, the Wilton Diptych and a number of church wall paintings. <!-- == Background == Edmund's name means 'protector of riches'.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Diadumenian (; ) (September 14/19, 208 – 218), was briefly Roman Emperor, in 218.

Creative Participation - originally a Lucien Lévy-Bruhl term from the 1920s for analysing social relations of cultural groupings, modified and revived by the German ethnologist V. Dahlheimer- rewrites the traditional participant observation approach and leaves more room for non-materialistic cognition. Dynamic movements which can not be measured from disconnected or relative viewpoints can be captured by means of feelings. Verification of data through creative participation is possible through practical conception only and can at best be validated by empirical means. Creative Participation seeks to counteract classical problems in social science like i.e. rigid defense of theory, personal ambition, and weight of tradition which can lead to social and personal fragmentation. In consumer psychology Creative Participation is defined as consumers' co-creation of novel and valuable products, services, ideas, consumption experiences with firms during their purchase or consumption process. According to \"Need for Uniqueness\"- theory, one of consumers' motivations for creative participation may come from their need for unique products. When consumers need to acquire the symbol of distinct self by unique products, they are driven to create. Creative Participation is also used as an educational training method. It can breakdown barriers between participants (and agencies), and encourage creative problem-solving, and the building of positive relationships. In the political world Creative Participation presents the theory and practice of innovative forms of political participation, i.e. citizens cooperate in public action to achieve a common good.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The World War I Memorial is a bronze sculpture by Pietro Montana and is located at the intersection of Taunton Avenue, Whelden Avenue, and John Street in East Providence, Rhode Island, United States.

It was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 that year. Later versions were available as free downloads, or in service packs, and included in the OEM service releases of Windows 95 and later versions of Windows. Originally Microsoft Internet Explorer only ran on Windows using Intel 80386 (IA-32) processor. Current versions also run on x64, 32-bit ARMv7, PowerPC and IA-64. Versions on Windows have supported MIPS, Alpha AXP and 16-bit and 32-bit x86 but currently support only 32-bit or 64-bit.

Later other buildings replaced these, and the site is now ruined, but it is the original complex that gives the site its fame. It was founded and richly endowed by Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, the chief minister of Ghazan Khan. Rashid-al-Din sought to gather the most famous intellectuals of his time in fields of philosophy, science and medicine. The establishment started to decline after the execution of Rashid al din in 1318, though his son Ghiyas al-Din ibn Rashid al-Din led a revival in the 1330s, until his own murder in 1336. The foundation document of the complex survives, dated August 1307, and gives a detailed picture of how the complex was supposed to function. There are later appendices, and the site may well have been functioning before 1307. There was provision for over 100 employees, about a quarter labourers and the rest skilled professionals, as well as 220 slaves. There was also provision for salaried students. In addition to all these the complex held a workshop for the production of books, where the early manuscripts of the ''Jami' al-tawarikh'', and in the 1330s probably the Great Mongol Shahnameh were produced. The site had fallen into ruin when Shah Abbas chose it for a fort, including the governor's palace. By the end of the 17th century these buildings too were in ruins, as a traveller reported. Only a small part of the ruined establishment remains standing with most of its remaining structures perhaps under the ground. Archaeologists are excavating and studying the large complex. Today, the historical elements of the Rab'-e Rashidi can no longer be identified. All that remains are some masonry bases of the fortifications that were built either during the 14th century or by Shah Abbas in the 17th century.

It is a fairly simplistic model, employing several simplifying assumptions, most notably the assumption that every fertilisation event may be classed as either self-fertilisation, or outcrossing with a completely random mate. Thus the only model parameter to be estimated is the probability of self-fertilisation. The mixed mating model originated in the 1910s, with plant breeders who were seeking evidence of outcrossing contamination of self-pollinating crops, but a formal description of the model and its parameter estimation was not published until 1951. The model is still in common use today, though a number of more complex models are also now in use. For example, a weakness of the model lies in its assumption that inbreeding occurs only as a result of self-fertilisation; in reality, inbreeding may also occur through outcrossing between closely related individuals. The effective selfing model relaxes this assumption by seeking also to estimate the degree of shared ancestry of outcrossing mates.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The West Virginia Miners are a collegiate summer baseball team located in Beckley, West Virginia.
