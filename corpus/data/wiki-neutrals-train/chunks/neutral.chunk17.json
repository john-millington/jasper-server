{"lines":[{"value":"Balblair Distillery is a Scotch whisky distillery located in Edderton, Ross-shire, Scotland. Founded in 1790, the distillery was rebuilt in 1895 by the designer Charles C Doig to be closer to the Edderton Railway Station on the Inverness and Ross-shire Railway line. However, so good was the original water source that the rebuilt distillery chose to ignore a nearby burn in favour of the original Ault Dearg burn. To this day, the Balblair Distillery continues to use this original water source. John Ross, the founder, ran Balblair as a thriving business and in 1824 he was joined by his son, Andrew. The distillery stayed in the Ross family until 1894 when the tenancy was taken over by Alexander Cowan. In 1948 the freehold was bought by Robert Cumming, who promptly expanded the distillery and increased production. Cumming ran the distillery until he retired in 1970 when he sold it to Hiram Walker. In 1996 Balblair Distillery was purchased by Inver House Distillers Limited. Balblair has one of the oldest archives in distilling, with the first ledger entry dated 25 January 1800. John Ross himself penned that first entry, which read: “Sale to David Kirkcaldy at Ardmore, one gallon of whisky at £1.8.0d”. Balblair Single Malt Whisky is bottled in vintages - the current bottlings being 2005, 1999, 1990 and 1983 - with the design inspired by the nearby Pictish stone Clach Biorach, which is thought to be 4000 years old. The 1989 vintage won a Gold Medal and was judged \"best in class\" in the 2007 International Wine & Spirits Competition and was recommended by Ian Buxton in 101 Whiskies to Try Before You Die. The distillery is now owned by Inver House Distillers Limited, whose other distilleries include the Speyburn-Glenlivet Distillery, Knockdhu Distillery, Old Pulteney Distillery and Balmenach Distillery. The distillery now has a visitor centre. Open all year to visitors.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"'''Dr. Shankar Acharya''' () (b. October, 1945) is an Indian economist.

Whether the family origin is Anglo-Saxon, Norman, or Strathclyde Briton is unclear. The family name may be derived from several etymological possibilities. The name is presumed to have been derived from Musgrave, Mewsgrave, or Musgreave: \"the keeper of the king's hawks, or the king's equerry.\" Another possibility is the Anglo Saxon mus for \"mouse\" and grav for \"mossy plain\". The historian William Camden said that they gained their name from the village of Great Musgrave, where they settled, but Arthur Collins suggested that the name was a variation of the title margrave, meaning march-warden. The Coat of Arms granted to Sir Thomas Musgrave in the reign of Edward 111 (1327 - 1377) depicts six gold annulets, three, two and one, on a red shield.

Since the introduction by its founder Yuan-Cheng Fung, the field of biomechanics has become one of the branches of mechanics and bioscience. For many years, biomechanics has examined tissue. Through advancements in nanoscience, the scale of the forces that could be measured and also the scale of observation of biomaterials was reduced to \"nano\" and \"pico\" level. Consequently, it became possible to measure the mechanical properties of biological materials at nanoscale. Most of the biological materials have different hierarchical levels, and the smallest ones refer to the nanoscale. For example, bone has up to seven levels of biological organization, and the smallest level, i.e., single collagen fibril and hydroxylapatite minerals have dimensions well below 100 nm. Therefore, being able to probe properties at this small scales provides a great opportunity for better understanding the fundamental properties of these materials. For example, measurements have shown that nanomechanical heterogeneity exists even within single collagen fibrils as small as 100 nm. One of the other most relevant topics in this field is measurement of tiny forces on living cells to recognize changes caused by different diseases. For example, it has been shown that red blood cells infected by malaria are 10 times stiffer than normal cells. Likewise, it has been shown that cancer cells are 70 percent softer than normal cells. Early signs of aging cartilage and osteoarthritis has been shown by looking at the changes in the tissue at the nanoscale.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"William Leechman (1706–1785) was a Scottish minister, theologian and academic.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Emma Ciardi (1879–1933) was an Italian painter.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Epacternis mabokealis is a species of snout moth in the genus Epacternis.

Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992), was a United States Supreme Court case decided on June 12, 1992, in which the court held that a group of American wildlife conservation and other environmental organizations lacked standing to challenge regulations jointly issued by the U.S. Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce, regarding the geographic area to which a particular section of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 applied. The case arose over issues of US funding of development projects in Aswan, Egypt and Mahaweli, Sri Lanka that could harm endangered species in the affected areas. The government declared that the act did not apply to projects outside of the United States and Defenders of Wildlife sued. Said Lily Henning of the Legal Times: :In [this] decision, hailed by the right and attacked by the left as well as by a broad swath of legal scholars, the Court made clear that plaintiffs must suffer a concrete, discernible injury&mdash;not a \"conjectural or hypothetical one\"&mdash;to be able to bring suit in federal court. It, in effect, made it more difficult for plaintiffs to challenge the actions of a government agency when the actions don't directly affect them. Writing for the plurality, Justice Scalia stated that Defenders had failed to satisfy Constitutional requirements for “injury in fact” that would grant standing under the Endangered Species Act. He wrote that the Court rejected the view that the citizen suit provision of the statute conferred upon “all persons an abstract, self-contained, non-instrumental ‘right’ to have the Executive observe the procedures required by law.\" Rather, he explained, an American citizen plaintiff must have suffered a tangible and particular harm.Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice David Souter asserted in their concurring opinion that an airline ticket to the affected geographic areas with endangered species in question would have been enough to satisfy the imminent threat of future injury requirement.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Izurtza (in Basque and officially, in Spanish Izurza) is an elizate, town and municipality located in the province of Biscay, in the Basque Country, Spain.

Taking place immediately after the release of the band's fourth album, all tickets sold out despite going on sale less than a week before the commencement of the tour. Second shows at Wembley and at Manchester needed to be added after fans queued for up to eighteen hours in order to secure a ticket.

These five hour shows included bizarre vaudeville circus acts with plate spinners, trapeze artists and performing pigs which were dressed in policeman's uniforms. The concerts also incorporated supporting acts such as Stone the Crows, which was a rare event for Led Zeppelin at this point in their career. A colour poster was sold to fans at the concerts for 30p, which is now a rare and highly sought-after collectible.

Raised in a Jewish home, he moved to Brazil with his family before settling in Caracas, Venezuela in the early 1950s, becoming a Venezuelan citizen in 1955. Fluent in English, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish, he studied at the Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned two post-graduate degrees in economics and chemical industry. In his new home Braunstein, along with his father, founded the firm Braunstein Asociados, an advertising agency which lasted for more than five decades. Besides this, he was an avid jazz collector and a true connoisseur of the bridge whist game, but found time to teach marketing techniques at universities throughout Venezuela. Nevertheless, he was recognized as an international ambassador for jazz and its promotion as an art form. Since arriving to Venezuela, Braunstein became an active participant in the local jazz community for most of his life, as founder of his radio show Idioma del Jazz in 1955 and the Caracas Jazz Club in 1956. On August 12 of this year, he promoted the first official jazz concert in Venezuela at Caracas National Theater inviting the clarinetist and saxophonist John LaPorta, who was backed by several jazz bands during his stay in Caracas, while a selection of the repertoire performed at the concert was released under the title South American Brothers by Fantasy Records. Since then, Braunstein gained quite a reputation over the years for coming up by organizing concerts with notables jazz groups led by Nat Adderley, Monty Alexander, Jeff Berlin, Eddie Bert, Randy Brecker, Louis Armstrong, Gary Burton, Charlie Byrd, Chick Corea, Paco de Lucía, Paquito D'Rivera, Bill Evans, Maynard Ferguson, Dizzy Gillespie, Winton Marsalis, Woody Herman, Barney Kessel, Tito Puente, Miroslav Vitouš and Paul Winter, among others.

Fields where they are applied include automotive, medical, aerospace, micro system and information technology as well as for quality and production control. The optimization of vibration and acoustic behavior are important goals of product development in all of these fields because they are often among the key characteristics that determine a product’s success in the market. They are also in widespread use throughout many universities conducting basic and applied research in areas that include structural dynamics, modal analysis, acoustic optimization and non-destructive evaluation. The operating principle is based on the Doppler effect, which occurs when light is back-scattered from a vibrating surface. Both velocity and displacement can be determined by analyzing the optical signals in different ways. A scanning laser vibrometer integrates computer-controlled X,Y scanning mirrors and a video camera inside an optical head. The laser is scanned point-by-point over the test object’s surface to provide a large number of very high spatial resolution measurements. This sequentially measured vibration data can be used to calculate and visualize animated deflection shapes in the relevant frequency bands from frequency domain analysis. Alternatively, data can be acquired in the time domain to, for example, generate animations showing wave propagation across structures. In contrast to contact measuring methods, the test object is unaffected by the vibration measuring process. Today, vibrometry covers a huge range of applications such as the study of microstructures moving only a few pm at frequencies up to 30 MHz, all the way up to the intense dynamics occurring in Formula 1 engines with vibration velocities approaching 30 m/s. A 3D scanning vibrometer combines three optical sensors that accurately detect dynamic movement from different directions in space in order to completely determine the 3D vectors of motion. The software allows each individual x-, y- or z-direction component to be displayed independently, or combined into a single representation. Data can be exported for finite element model validation at nodes previously imported from the model for scan grid definition.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Ezio Carabella (3 March 1891 in Rome – 19 April 1964 in Rome) was an Italian operetta, song and film music composer.

A holder of the post would be the third-highest-ranked Great Officer of State, below the Lord High Steward and the Lord High Chancellor. The Lord High Treasurer functions as the head of Her Majesty's Treasury. Since the 17th century, the office has often been held, not by a single person, but placed in commission, so that a board of individuals jointly exercise the powers of the Lord High Treasurer. Such persons are known as Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. The office has been in commission continuously since the resignation of Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury in 1714. Although the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was created in 1801, it was not until the Consolidated Fund Act 1816 that the separate offices of Lord High Treasurer of Great Britain and Lord High Treasurer of Ireland were united into one office as the Lord High Treasurer of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 5 January 1817. The office continued in commission and the commissioners of the old office of Lord High Treasurer of Great Britain continued as the commissioners of the new combined office. In modern times, by convention, the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury include the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, usually serving as the \"First Lord of the Treasury\", and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, serving as the \"Second Lord of the Treasury\". Other members of the government, usually whips in the House of Commons, are appointed to serve as the junior Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Edwin A.

The party was founded in 1997 when a faction of the then-ruling Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) broke away, but was not registered until February 1999. Rev. Ratu Josaia Rayawa was appointed President of the party, with Ratu Epeli Ganilau, son of former Fijian President Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau and son-in-law of the then-current President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, as interim leader. Other prominent members of the party included Adi Koila Nailatikau (Mara's daughter and Ganilau's sister-in-law), Poseci Bune, Rev. Manasa Lasaro (a former Secretary-General of the Methodist Church, who had advocated banning all commercial and sporting activities on Sundays), and Josefa Vosanibola. In the general election of 1999, the VLV was widely seen as playing a spoiler role. Campaigning on a platform of strengthening anti-corruption laws, establishing programs to eradicate poverty, and reinforcing the family unit, it took 19 percent of the indigenous Fijian vote, mostly at the expense of the SVT, which lost the election. Ganilau himself failed to win a seat, however, and Bune replaced him as leader. The VLV joined the People's Coalition government of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, and Bune and Nailatikau were appointed to the Cabinet. The VLV splintered in the political realignment that followed the coup d'état, which deposed the Chaudhry government. Many of its members, including Rayawa and Vosanibola, joined the new Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua of interim Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, while others, including Bune, joined the Fiji Labour Party of deposed Prime Minister Chaudhry. A rump of the party continued under the leadership of Taniela Tabu and fielded two candidates, unsuccessfully, in the general election held to restore democracy in September 2001, but most members of this rump subsequently merged with members of the SVT and the New Labour Unity Party to form the Fiji Democratic Party under the leadership of the former SVT leader Filipe Bole. In 2005, this party merged into the new National Alliance Party of Fiji, founded by the former VLV leader, Ratu Epeli Ganilau.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Taiwan yuhina (Yuhina brunneiceps), also known as Formosan yuhina, is a small songbird endemic to the island of Taiwan.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Alex Jeremy Tudor (born 23 October 1977 in Kensington) is an English cricketer who has spent two spells with Surrey as well as playing for Essex. He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. He was awarded the NBC Denis Compton Award during the 1997 and 1998 season. A highly talented performer with bat and ball his career has been hampered by frequent injury trouble. Tudor's Test debut came in the 1998/99 Ashes series in which he played solidly with the bat and further impressed selectors while bowling, winning the praise of his opponents, in particular Australia's captain Mark Taylor. His further contributions with the bat were the subject of much attention as he batted against New Zealand and hit 99 not out, the highest-ever score by an English nightwatchman, which led him towards a Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year award; batting partner Graham Thorpe received much ribbing from their Surrey team mates for not letting him reach a century. Initial omission from the 2002/03 Ashes squad was over-ruled when he was selected above several injured players. Injuries in 2003 and 2004 followed, and despite his recovery being aided by visits to the German doctor Dr Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt, Tudor was released from his contract by Surrey at the end of the 2004 season. Essex gave him the chance to continue playing first-class cricket the following season, but it was to be another year blighted by injury. He managed to return to action in 2006, playing almost the full season. In August 2008, after a season in which he had failed to hold down a regular place in the Essex side, the county announced that they would be releasing Tudor at the end of the season. Later that month, he returned to Surrey, initially as part of a loan deal. He holds the distinction of bowling one of the most expensive overs on record. Bowling for Surrey against Andrew Flintoff at Old Trafford in 1998 he went for 6–4–4–4–4–6–6–0 (34) and in bowling 2 no balls incurred, under ECB regulations at the time, four more penalty runs for a total of 38 runs in one over. He rejoined Surrey on 24 October 2008. Alex continued to play for Nottinghams West Indian Cavaliers CC until 2012 but has rejoined his boyhood side of Spencer CC back in London.

In its characters and themes it anticipates some of the ground Powell would cover in A Dance to the Music of Time, a twelve-volume cycle that spans much of the 20th century and is widely considered Powell's masterpiece. Published in 1931, it focuses on the romantic adventures and discontents of one William Atwater, together with a circle of his friends and acquaintances, in London around the end of the 1920s. Atwater, a museum clerk, pursues a never-fulfilled relationship with Susan Nunnery throughout the novel, while other characters – painter Raymond Pringle, Harriet Twining, Lola, Verelst, the American publisher Scheigan, and Susan’s father George amongst them – carry on similar dissatisfying quests for emotional fulfilment. The novel is predominantly comic, with persistent melancholy and occasional vitriol also present. Like much of Powell’s fiction, the novel portrays British society and its subtly stratified interconnections by focusing in detail on individual behaviour both in social situations–at parties, country weekends, at work–and in solitude. The novel belongs clearly to its era, showing the influence of cinema as both entertainment and as a means of constructing a narrative. As a first novel, Afternoon Men is, perhaps, a little harsher in its humour than a reader might expect, given the subtlety of wit for which Powell later became renowned. The title is drawn from Robert Burton’s The Anatomy of Melancholy, and the novel accords with Burton’s insistence on the need to laugh at human foibles.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Gilbertstone is a residential suburban area straddling the border of Yardley and South Yardley in Birmingham, West Midlands.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Wildy Petoud (born 1957) is a Swiss science fiction writer who won the Prix Rosny-Aîné in 1993.

Karl Marx described the function of the executive of a capitalist state as                                            \"nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie\". Specifically, in Marx's view, the capitalist state necessarily exists to serve the interests of capitalists (referred to as \"the bourgeoisie\"). Thus thinkers in the Marxist tradition often refer to the capitalist state as the Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Margherita Rinaldi (born 12 January 1935) is an Italian lyric soprano, primarily active in the 1960s and 1970s. Rinaldi was born in Turin, Italy, and completed her music studies in Rovigo. She won a voice competition in Spoleto and made her debut there in 1958 in the title role of Lucia di Lammermoor. Her debut at La Scala in Milan came the following year as Sinaide in Rossini's Mosè in Egitto. Rinaldi sang at most of the major opera houses in Italy, in roles such as Amina in La sonnambula, Adina in ''L'elisir d'amore, Norina in Don Pasquale and especially Gilda in Rigoletto''. She also excelled in operas by Mozart and Cimarosa. Rinaldi won acclaim as Giulietta in Claudio Abbado's version of Bellini's I Capuleti e i Montecchi, opposite Giacomo Aragall and Luciano Pavarotti, at La Scala in 1966, and also as Linda in a revival of Linda di Chamounix again at La Scala, in 1972, opposite Alfredo Kraus. She sang a wide variety of roles for RAI between 1963 and 1975, such as Bertha in Le Prophète, Cleopatra in Giulio Cesare, Ginevra in Ariodante, and Noraime in Les Abencérages. In 1977 she had a triumph singing Amenaide in Rossini's Tancredi opposite Horne at Teatro dell'Opera in Rome. The night was broadcast by RAI TV.In 1978, Rinaldi appeared as Adalgisa in a production of Bellini's Norma at the Teatro Comunale in Florence. Conducted by Riccardo Muti and starring Renata Scotto in the title role, these performances offered the Florentine public a rare chance to hear a lyric soprano as the younger, more vulnerable character of Adalgisa, according to the composer's intention. In November of the same year Rinaldi sang Ines in Meyerbeer's ''L'Africaine'' at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, opposite Plácido Domingo and Grace Bumbry. Rinaldi also enjoyed a successful international career, making her American debut at the Dallas Opera as Gilda in 1966. Her debut at the San Francisco Opera was as Lucia in 1968. She also sang at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Rinaldi also performed at the Glyndebourne, Wexford and Bregenz festivals. Rinaldi made only two commercial recordings, Gilda in Rigoletto opposite Rolando Panerai and Franco Bonisolli, which was also the soundtrack of a German television production, and Ilia in Idomeneo with Sir Colin Davis conducting. Luckily, unofficial \"pirate\" recordings have preserved several of her live performances: the Spoleto Lucia di Lammermoor,the Scala I Capuleti e i Montecchi and Linda di Chamounix, the RAI Le Prophète, a 1967 Rigoletto from Turin, and the 1978 Norma from Florence. Margherita Rinaldi was also an excellent performer of sacred music: she performed at La Scala Rossini's Petite Messe Solennelle or for RAI TV Mozart's Vesperae solennes de confessore. She took part in the first recording of Rossini's Messa di gloria (1974). Margherita Rinaldi retired from the stage in 1981. She lives outside Florence where she privately coaches young singers.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Meon is a hamlet in south Hampshire, England.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Text J of the rongorongo corpus, also known as '(London) reimiro 1', is the larger of two inscribed reimiro in London and one of two dozen surviving rongorongo texts.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Secwepemc Cultural Education Society (SCES) is a non-profit organization in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada governed by representatives from thirteen bands of the Secwepemc Nation and a representative from the Secwepemc Elders Council.

In evolutionary biology, and especially paleontology, Chengjiang County is noted for soft-tissue fossil finds, of the Maotianshan Shales, dated <= 518 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion, which \"are as spectacular as the Burgess Shale fauna, and significantly older.\" These fossils are considered one of the most important fossil finds of the 20th century. They contain an exquisite degree of detail, cover a diverse range of fauna, and are significant in attempts to understand the evolution of life on Earth. The fossils were first discovered by Henri Mansuy and Jaques Deprat who described them in 1912, the year after Charles Walcott's initial publications on the Burgess Shale. It was not until 1984 that the true significance of the palaeontology of the region was realised by Hou Xian-guang, a professor at Yunnan University, Kunming, where he is director of the Research Center for Chengjiang Biota. Previously he was a professor at the Palaeontological Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing. Chengjiang is an underdeveloped county having rich phosphate deposits above and below the formation holding the lagerstätte. They have been exploited in part through efforts that began at about the same time that Hou Xian-guang discovered the deposits that bear these exceptional fossils, with phosphate mining bringing in some 2/3 of the county's revenue in 2003. Efforts were made to close the region to mining in a bid to support the county's bid for listing as a World Heritage Site, given the scientific significance of the fossils. A consequence of this was renewed mining efforts in the region, which threatened the fossil-bearing strata due to erosion, slumping of overburden, and simple destruction by the mining efforts. Chengjiang County faces a dilemma between calls for preservation of the treasure trove of early Cambrian fossils, the economic reliance it has on the phosphate industry, and the difficulty of finding a balance between exploitation and restoration of the land while this is still possible.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Sverdlovsky City District () is one of the seven city districts of the city of Perm in Perm Krai, Russia, located in the Kama River's left bank.

Due to the initially lenient arrangements, in which the Nazi occupation authority allowed the democratic government to stay in power, the resistance movement was slower to develop effective tactics on a wide scale than in some other countries. By 1943, many Danes were involved in underground activities, ranging from producing illegal publications to spying and sabotage. Major groups included the communist BOPA (, Civil Partisans) and Holger Danske, both based in Copenhagen. Resistance agents killed an estimated 400 Danish Nazis, informers and collaborators until 1944. After that date, they also killed some German nationals. In the postwar period, the Resistance was supported by politicians within Denmark and there was little effort to closely examine the killings.

In late 1996, after some line-up changes, Ultimatum rechartered their direction, taking a more personal and broader political focus in their lyrics. They garnered a following around Australia and in Europe with the release of their first self-titled EP in 1997, recorded by engineer Scott Harper and mastered by Martin Pullan.

This allows the user to post-process the received data to produce a more accurate result &mdash; usually with other data unknown to the original receiver, such as better models of the atmospheric conditions at time of measurement. The final output of a navigation receiver is usually its position, speed or other related physical quantities. However, the calculation of these quantities are based on a series of measurements from one or more satellite constellations. Although receivers calculate positions in real time, in many cases it is interesting to store intermediate measures for later use. RINEX is the standard format that allows the management and disposal of the measures generated by a receiver, as well as their off-line processing by a multitude of applications, whatever the manufacturer of both the receiver and the computer application. The RINEX format is designed to evolve over time, adapting to new types of measurements and new satellite navigation systems. The first RINEX version was published by W. Gurtner and G. Mader in the CSTG GPS Bulletin of September/October 1990. Since 1993 the RINEX 2 is available, which has been revised and adopted several times. RINEX enables storage of measurements of pseudorange, carrier-phase, Doppler and signal-to-noise from GPS (including GPS modernization signals e.g. L5 and L2C), GLONASS, Galileo, Beidou, along with data from EGNOS and WAAS satellite based augmentation systems (SBAS), QZSS, simultaneously. RINEX version 3.02 was submitted in April 2013 and is capable of new measurements from GPS or Galileo systems. The most recent version is RINEX 3.03 from July 2015 with update 1 to 3.03 published in 2017. Although not part of the RINEX format, the Hatanaka compression scheme  is commonly used to reduced the size of RINEX files, resulting in an ASCII-based CompactRINEX format. .

Options may include the size of the payload, count of tests, limits for the number of network hops (TTL) that probes traverse, and interval between the requests.
