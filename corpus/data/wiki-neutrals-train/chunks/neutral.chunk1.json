The Suir and Nore rise in the same mountainous area in County Tipperary, near the Devil's Bit, while the Barrow rises in the Slieve Bloom Mountains in County Laois. The Nore flows into the Barrow about 17 km before the Suir and Barrow join to form an estuary called Waterford Harbour east of the city of Waterford. The rivers fan out to drain a large portion of the southern part of the island, including Counties Tipperary, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford and Waterford, among others. The lengths of the three rivers of the Three Sisters are the Barrow - 192 km (119 mi), the Suir - 185 km (115 mi) and the Nore - 140 km (87 mi). The combined catchment area of the Three Sisters is 9,207 km 2, made up of the Suir's (3,610 km 2 ), the Barrow's (3,067 km 2 ) and the Nore's (2,530 km 2 ). The combined long term average flow rate of the Three Sisters into Waterford Harbour is 157 m 3 /s, almost half of which is made up of the Suir's (76.9 m 3 /s), followed by the Nore's (42.9 m 3 /s) and the Barrow's (37.4 m 3 /s). The Barrow Bridge crosses two of the Three Sisters, the Nore and the Barrow. They then join the River Suir just of the bridge. This place is known in Irish as Cumar na dTrí Uisce, \"the confluence of the three waters\". The Nore joins the Barrow some four kilometres north of New Ross and the combined waters of the three sisters that can be seen from Cheekpoint. The combined waters of all three sisters are then visible all the way down the estuary from Cheekpoint on.In ancient times, the area bounded by the Suir and the Barrow formed the Kingdom of Ossory. This name is retained today for dioceses in both the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland.

This means that it can be cheaper to hedge a portfolio of credit default swaps or bonds with a CDS index than it would be to buy many single name CDS to achieve a similar effect.

According to Clifford Geertz it was invented as recently as 1923. Ketoprak troupes might own or rent a performance building, such as Ketoprak Srimulat that used to be performed in a theatre both in Jakarta and Surabaya back in the 1980s, or troupes might travel through villages. The travelling ketoprak troupe is called Kethoprak Tobong, also known as Ketoprak Tonil. It might be considered as common people theatrical tradition in Java. The show were performed in certain period in an empty plain near a village and moved from one place to another, in fashion similar to western travelling circus. In this traveling troupe, the performers and staffs also brought show properties; such as costumes, stage decorations, chairs, gamelan, sound system, diesel electric generator, all were contained in a portable building that also used as set or stage called \"tobong\".

Dawn (born August 20, 1948, in Napoleon, Ohio) is an American Christian theologian, author, musician and educator, associated with the parachurch organization Christians Equipped for Ministry in Vancouver, Washington. She also serves as Teaching Fellow in Spiritual Theology at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia. Dawn is generally perceived as a Lutheran evangelical. She often writes in a paleo-orthodox style, stressing the importance of Christian tradition and the wisdom of the Church through the centuries. Her birth surname is Gersmehl; Dawn is a pseudonym. A scholar with four master's degrees and a Ph.D. in Christian Ethics and the Scriptures from the University of Notre Dame, she has taught for clergy and worship conferences and at seminaries throughout the United States and Canada and in Australia, England, Hong Kong, Ireland, Japan, Madagascar, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore and Scotland. She is also well known as a preacher and speaker for all ages and sometimes contributes to worship by means of her musical gifts. She is married to Myron Sandberg. Her 1995 book, Reaching Out Without Dumbing Down: A Theology of Worship for the Turn-of-the-Century Culture, which urged a second look at so-called \"contemporary Christian worship\", caused a stir in evangelical circles, being the first scholarly work from within the evangelical community to seriously question \"seeker sensitive\" style worship. Dawn claims that much contemporary worship, which seeks primarily to evangelize through entertainment, is not really Christian worship at all. Rather than focus on bringing people into the church through worship, Dawn argues that worship should instead focus upon the glory and grace of the triune God, not ignoring the artistic treasures and traditions of the Church through the ages. The book remains her most widely read and most talked about work. Dawn continued this exploration in her 1999 book, A Royal \"Waste\" of Time: The Splendor of Worshiping God and Being Church for the World. In her more recent work, Dawn has drawn on Albert Borgmann's notion of the device paradigm to develop a critique of the church in its capitulation to commodification where worship, for example, becomes a device to attract and please.

Stanley \"Stan\" Melvin Berenstain (September 29, 1923 – November 26, 2005) was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Janice \"Jan\" Marian Berenstain (née Grant; July 26, 1923 – February 24, 2012) was born and was raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and attended Radnor High School in Radnor, Pennsylvania. Stan was Jewish and Jan was Episcopalian. They met on their first day of art school at the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art in 1941. During WWII, Stan served as a military medical illustrator while Jan was a draft artist for the Army Corps of Engineers in addition to working in an aircraft factory. Jan fashioned a pair of wedding rings from spare aluminum collected at the latter job, and the two married on April 17, 1946. Stan died of cancer at age 82 on November 26, 2005 after the couple were married for 59 years. Jan died on February 24, 2012, after suffering a massive stroke, at age 88. They are survived by their two sons, Mike and Leo Berenstain. In an interview about the books, the Berenstains said that a big reason behind their inspiration was some of the difficulties parents faced, as well as some childhood tribulations when they were kids themselves. The Berenstains also noted there were some issues which seemed to appear in every generation, such as kids throwing tantrums in public places, which made important subject matter for their stories. However, they deliberately wanted to steer clear of overly heavy issues, such as violence. In their later years, critics sometimes dismissed the books for having social attitudes stuck in the 1950s along with the bears' clothing styles and penchant for activities such as playing jacks and hopscotch, even though they did change with the times somewhat by introducing things like video games and cell phones. After the birth of their son Michael (now Mike) in 1951, the couple published ''The Berenstains' Baby Book'', which dealt with the issues of pregnancy and child-rearing. Although containing practical advice, the book used humor and reminded parents not to take every situation too seriously. They would go on to publish another two books on parenting, How to Teach Your Children About Sex Without Making a Complete Fool of Yourself and Have a Baby, My Wife Just Had a Cigar!. They produced together the magazine cartoon feature ''It's All in the Family from 1956 to 1989 in McCall's and Good Housekeeping''. Inspired by their children's enthusiasm for Dr. Seuss books, the Berenstains decided to attempt a series with animal protagonists themselves, settling on bears not because of their surname as was commonly believed, but because they found them easy to draw. They published their first book featuring the Berenstain Bears, The Big Honey Hunt, in 1962. At the time, their inspiration, Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss), was working as an editor in the children's division of Random House Publishing and eagerly approved the concept. He edited several books in the Berenstain Bears series and created a lasting franchise including many more books, television series, toys, and stage productions. Over 300 books were published in 23 languages. Jan was inducted into Radnor High School's Hall of Fame on October 20, 2006. The Berenstains' cartoon feature ''It's All in the Family (unrelated to the similarly named TV series) appeared regularly in McCall's'' and depicted the antics of a suburban family with mother, father, eldest and youngest sons, and middle daughter. ''It's All in the Family'' was not a conventional comic strip in the sense of a sequential progression of panels. Each issue featured a single situation, often seasonally appropriate, such as the daughter preparing, cooking, and serving a family meal for the first time or the costume preparations, rehearsal, and performance of the youngest child's Christmas pageant. Within a given issue, each ''It's All in the Family'' drawing was a stand-alone panel with a caption gag, rather than one panel of a sequential strip, but individual panels in order depicted the complete arc (preparation, completion, aftermath) of that issue's family experience. Stan and Jan Berenstain's younger son Michael Berenstain (born in 1951) is a writer/illustrator and also illustrated many of the books written by his parents. He continued to work with his mother on new projects until her death in 2012, with a focus on promoting Christian religious practices.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Charter Communications, Inc. is an American telecommunications company that offers its services to consumers and businesses under the branding of Spectrum.

Most common in racehorses, drug tests are also performed on horses in endurance riding and in international competition such as the Olympics and FEI-sanctioned competition. Many horses in competition sanctioned by various national organizations, such as the United States Equestrian Federation in the USA are also tested for improper drug use. Before the mid-1980s, the use of high potency performance altering substances in racing was less well controlled due to the inadequacy of analytical technology. Around that time, highly sensitive ELISA testing of horse urine was introduced to racing regulators by a group at the University of Kentucky. This proprietary technology essentially solved the problem of the abuse of high potency drugs in racing horses. ELISA tests are now marketed worldwide out of Lexington, Kentucky. Traces of therapeutic medications and dietary and environmental substances can be detected using current testing technology. This has created controversy over a \"zero tolerance\" approach to drug testing, and resulted in the establishment of regulatory limits or \"thresholds\" (the urine or blood concentration of a substance below which there is no pharmacological activity, i.e., there is no effect, a so-called \"No Effect Threshold\" or NET). Recent challenges in drug testing include the development of effective regulatory methods for the newer hormonal products such as the various human recombinant erythropoietin products and variants and growth hormones. A high-quality ELISA test for human recombinant erythropoietin is now available, and recently the first Mass Spectral Confirmation method to detect use of human recombinant erythropoietin (rhEPO) in horses or any species was developed.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Solinari is the second album by the American doom metal band Morgion.

Often referred to as \"the Brazilian anthem of 1967\", it later appeared on his influential eponymous 1968 album. At first booed at the 1967 Rede Record festival for its use of electric guitars, Caetano's interpretation and attitude eventually won the audience over. It placed fourth at the festival. Caetano has called it his \"best-known song\", comparing it to the Rolling Stones' \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" in terms of its place in his oeuvre. He partially based the song's composition on the previous year's winner, Chico Buarque's much more conventional \"A Banda\", purposely incorporating controversial rock and roll instrumentation – provided by the Paulino band The Beat Boys – to provoke the crowd. Although \"alegria\" means \"joy\" or \"happiness\" in Portuguese, the theme of the song is freedom. Caetano took the title phrase from the popular TV personality Chacrinha, who had in turn borrowed it from singer Wilson Simonal. The song is, alongside Daniela Mercury's \"O Canto da Cidade\", remembered by the population for the 1992 Fernando Collor de Mello impeachment.

He was a firm supporter of the region's public hospitals, highways, and its indigenous Southeastern Louisiana University.

Dynamically typed languages usually treat undefined values explicitly when possible. For instance, Perl has   operator which can \"assign\" such value to a variable.

It is the seat of the Larecaja Province and the Sorata Municipality. At the time of census 2001 it had a population of 2,217. It is a somewhat popular weekend getaway and a relaxing base camp for a growing number of hikers. It includes several small hotels, including a converted Italian mansion. In colonial days, Sorata provided a link to the Alto Beni goldfields and rubber plantations, and a gateway to the Amazon Basin. In August 1781 it was the site of an unorthodox siege by the nephew of Tupac Amaru, Andres, and his 16,000 soldiers. They constructed dikes above the town, and when these had been filled with runoff from the slopes of the nearby peak Illampu, they opened the floodgates and the town was washed away. The citizens of Sorata have, in recent history, violently opposed what they see as the rule of a too centralised government. For example, in the summer of 2005, the town was blockaded and inaccessible for several days in response to the government's plans to privatise Bolivia'a oil reserves. Sorata is no longer a major commercial center, as there is now a more direct route to the Yungas from La Paz. Today it is best known to foreign tourists, trekkers, and climbers, who visit this formerly little-known destination. The main square, Plaza General Enrique Penaranda, is Sorata's showcase. It is graced by towering date palms and immaculate gardens. The main town fiesta is held on September 14. Of note is Casa Gunthere, a historic mansion that now houses the Residencial Sorata. It was built in 1895 as the home of the Richters, a quinine trading family. Sorata is located at the base of the mountains Illampu, 6,368 m (20,892 ft), and Janq'u Uma, 6,427 m (21,086 ft), which are the northern anchors of the Cordillera Real. By the most reliable figures, Janq'u Uma is 11 m (36 ft) lower than Illimani, near La Paz, but surveys in the area are imperfect, and there is much debate between the citizens of both areas as to which mountain is higher.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"SAFARI was an attempt by the French government, under the presidency of Georges Pompidou, to create a centralized database of personal data.

The terms \"menstruation\" and \"menses\" are derived from the Latin mensis (month), which in turn relates to the Greek mene (moon) and to the roots of the English words month and moon. To many, such cultural associations appear persuasive in view of the fact that in humans, the menstrual cycle quite closely approximates the moon's 29.5-day synodic cycle, unlike in chimpanzees (~36 days) or bonobos (~40 days). Statistical information from hunter gatherers is lacking, but where large-scale western studies focus on women's peak reproductive years—removing outlier values—the cycle length gravitates around 29.1–29.5 days, while the figure for women in their thirties shortens toward 28 days. In no extant human population has statistically significant lunar phase-locking been demonstrated. Turning to the evolutionary past, however, a possible adaptive basis for the biological capacity would be reproductive levelling: among primates, synchronising to any natural clock makes it difficult for an alpha male to monopolise fertile sex with multiple females. This would be consistent with the striking gender egalitarianism of extant non-storage hunter-gatherer societies. A further deep-time evolutionary pressure may have been lions' habit of eating people on moonless nights. When early Pleistocene hominids in Africa were attempting to survive by robbing big cats of their kills,  according to some evolutionary scientists, it may have been adaptive to restrict overnight journeys—including sexual liaisons—to times when there was a moon in the sky.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Anna University Regional Office Coimbatore previously known as Anna University of Technology, Coimbatore is a regional office of Anna University.

Taub was called the \"Brider Rebbe\", after his paternal ancestor Rabbi Aharon Tzvi Taub, the Hasidic rebbe of Brid in Hungary. Taub was born about 1917 in Khust, Hungary (now Ukraine) as the eldest child of his father, Shmuel David, a grandson of the rebbe of Brid, and to his mother Yocheved Yitl née Grunwald, whose father was part of the Grunwald rabbinic family. Shmuel David, originally from Berehovo, had studied before their marriage under her uncle, Rabbi Moshe Grunwald (called the \"Arugas HaBosem\"), the rabbi of Khust. After his birth, Taub's parents removed from Khust and later settled in Muzhay, Hungary (now Muzhiyevo, Ukraine) where they lived until the Holocaust. In his teens, Taub studied in the yeshivot of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, who later became the Satmar Rebbe, first in Kruli (Carei), then in Satmar (Satu Mare). At age eighteen, Taub married Sarah Chanah Leah, the only daughter of Elimelech Lieber, a wealthy resident of Apsha near Solotvyno in the Maramureș region who was a trusted friend of Rabbi Chaim Tzvi Teitelbaum, the rabbi of nearby Sighet and the brother of the rabbi of Satmar. Having earned the admiration of the rabbi of Solotvyno and the surrounding villages, Rabbi Eisik Halberstam (the rabbi of Sighet's son-in-law), he was appointed as the dayan (rabbinical judge) of the village of Behutz at the age of twenty, where he remained for about two years until he became, for a short while, a dayan in Solotvyno itself; this was his last position before the Holocaust. During the Holocaust, Taub, his wife and their five children were taken to Auschwitz; he alone survived. His parents, who were then in the ghetto in Berehovo, as well as his maternal grandfather and his father-in-law were also taken to Auschwitz in 1944 and killed. In the 1950s the Rebbe Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum asked him to come to Baltimore, where he established this synagogue. Taub gained a reputation for showing a love of people and an interest in improving their lives, for making peace between people, and for his joy in life and the opportunities it afforded for doing God's will. He married six times, the last time in 1993. He died on July 14, 2007, and was buried in Kiryas Joel, New York, next to Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum.

The piece was regularly performed by amateur theatre groups, particularly in Britain, from 1910 through the 1930s, but it has been produced only rarely since then. Some of the language and stereotyping in the show reflect the period in which it was written and would not now be considered politically correct. However, a close inspection to the lyrics of such songs as Samee Gamee display a gentle mocking of the pretension of Western superiority.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Félix-Antoine Savard, (August 31, 1896 &ndash; August 24, 1982) was a Canadian priest, academic, poet, novelist and folklorist.

For internal administration, the city of Rome was a divided by the Emperor Augustus into fourteen regions. From the fourth century developed (evidently in connection with the seven Roman deacons) an ecclesiastical division into seven regions, which gradually replaced the earlier civil divisions. Many branches of the ecclesiastical administration were arranged in accordance with the seven regions — especially the care of the poor, provision for the maintenance of the churches, and whatever else pertained primarily to the office of the deacons, one of whom was appointed over each of the seven regions (diaconus regionarius). As the deacons were assisted by seven subdeacons, we also find the term subdeaconus regionarius. The notaries and es employed in the administration of the regions were also known as notarii regionarii and defensores regionarii. There is also occasional mention of acolyti regionarii.

The march starts in Hyde Park and moves through Oxford Street in the famous West End shopping district, stopping traffic. It is followed by a rally in Trafalgar Square, with survivors of violence speaking to the crowd. MWR has no corporate sponsors, and the organisers are grassroots activists without ties to large charities or NGOs. It was founded in 2007 by campaigner and former outreach worker Sabrina Qureshi. She was motivated in part by her childhood experiences growing up on a multicultural London housing estate, where violence against women was often treated as normal and unremarkable. She was also inspired by women's movements around the world, including women she met during a visit to Palestine and the DRC who continued their activism even amid danger and violence. OUR REALITY IN THE UK TODAY: One woman in four will experience domestic violence at some point in her life. Domestic violence has more repeat victims than any other crime (on average there will have been 35 assaults before a victim calls the police). Two women are murdered every week by their partner or ex partner. One incident of domestic violence is reported to the police every minute. One woman in four will experience sexual assault as an adult. Only 5% of rapes reported to the police result in the perpetrator being convicted in court. Women are more worried about rape than any other crime. 250 cases of forced marriage are reported each year. Up to 1,420 women per year are trafficked into the UK for sexual exploitation One woman a month is murdered in the name of ‘so called’ honour. Nearly 90% of local authorities do not have a rape crisis centre.

The term is typically used in metallurgy, describing the reduction of the content of carbon in metals (usually steel). Decarburization occurs when the metal is heated to temperatures of 700 °C or above when carbon in the metal reacts with gases containing oxygen or hydrogen. The removal of carbon removes hard carbide phases resulting in a softening of the metal, primarily at the surfaces which are in contact with the decarburizing gas. Decarburization can be either advantageous or detrimental, depending on the application for which the metal will be used. It is thus both something that can be done intentionally as a step in a manufacturing process, or something that happens as a side effect of a process (such as rolling) and must be either prevented or later reversed (such as via a carburization step). The decarburization mechanism can be described as three distinct events: the reaction at the steel surface, the interstitial diffusion of carbon atoms and the dissolution of carbides within the steel.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"New York State Route 352 (NY 352) is a state highway in the Southern Tier of New York in the United States.

It apparently lived in the Late Cretaceous; its remains were found in the early Maastrichtian (c.71-68 million years ago) Navesink Formation of New Jersey. A single species is included today, Telmatornis priscus. It was for some time united with other taxa of aquatic birds from around the Cretaceous-Paleocene boundary in the form taxon \"Graculavidae\", the supposed \"transitional shorebirds\", but this group is now known to be artificial. Some sources erroneously claim it was allied with ducks and geese. The reason for this is that the early anseriform Anatalavis rex was for some time included in Telmatornis. Hope (2002), however, noted that Telmatornis shares many characters with members of Charadriiformes, the ancient and diverse group of modern birds that includes for example gulls, auks and waders. A cladistic analysis of the forelimb skeleton (Varricchio 2002) found it highly similar to the great crested grebe and unlike the painted buttonquail (now known to be a basal charadriiform lineage), the black-necked stilt (a more advanced charadriiform), or the limpkin (a member of the Grui suborder of Gruiformes), namely in that its dorsal condyle of the humerus was not angled at 20°–30° away from long axis of the humerus. The analysis did not result in a phylogenetic pattern but rather grouped some birds with similar wing shapes together while others stood separate. It is thus unknown whether this apparent similarity to grebes represents an evolutionary relationship, or whether Telmatornis simply had a wing convergent on that of grebes and moved it like they do.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"F-box/LRR-repeat protein 5 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the FBXL5 gene.

The monastery was founded in 1794 by a group of Kollyvades monks, who had left the monastery of Mount Athos after disagreements about matters of Christian ritual. They were led by an ordained monk, Niphon of Chios, and included Gregorios Hatzistamatis, a local monk who had inherited land on Skiathos from his father. In 1807, a group of Greek freedom fighters met at the monastery and swore the Oath of Freedom on a newly designed Greek flag, a white cross on a sky-blue background, which was woven on a loom at the site. The fighters included Theodoros Kolokotronis, Andreas Vokos Miaoulis, Thymios Vlachavas, Nikotsaras and others. The Catholicon of the monastery is a Byzantine-style cross-in-square three-aisled church, with three domes, and stands at the centre of the complex.

The museum houses ecclesiastical artefacts and presents information on the history of the Monastery such as priests' vestments, rare books and manuscripts from the 17th century, gospels from the 18th century, silver and wooden crosses and Byzantine icons. The loom on which the first Greek flag was created can be seen. There is also a photographic record of the subsequent Greek War of Independence, which lasted from 1821 until 1829. Vineyards have been created for the production of Alypiakos, a red Muscat which was first produced on the island in the 5th century BC. The wine is named after Father Alypos, the fourth abbot of the monastery. Output has increased year on year, some of which is used within the Monastery on religious occasions. Today, the monastery is served by only four resident monks; three others associated with the monastery reside elsewhere. On 15 August each year the ceremony of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary takes place. Access is by foot from Skiathos town up a steep metalled road or by public minibus from Skiathos town bus terminus.

Formed from the Prussian Ministry of Public Works after the end of World War I, the RVM was in charge of regulating German railways, roadways, waterways, and the construction industry - a kind of infrastructure agency in today's understanding. In the 1920s, the Ministry's involvement in the rail sector was limited to administrative and technical supervisory functions. The National Railway (Deutsche Reichsbahn) was initially organized as an independent state-owned company to guarantee that Germany paid war reparations according to the provisions of the 1924 Dawes Plan. During the Third Reich the Transport Ministry expanded exponentially. The Reichsbahn, which had become Germany's largest public asset and also the largest such enterprise in the capitalist world at the time, was taken over by the RVM in 1937. Railroads in the German states, transportation associations, and even private transport companies also came under the Nazi government's direct control through the Ministry. During World War II the RVM took over agencies in conquered nations and provided military rail transport. It also became responsible for the deportation of European Jews to extermination camps. The particular unit involved, \"No. 21. Bulk Transport\", functioned in close cooperation with the SS. The RVM therefore came to play a pivotal role in The Holocaust. The Ministry lived on for a time after the war in the Flensburg Government and was dissolved de facto at the end of May, 1945. The Ministry's headquarters were located in central Berlin on the Wilhelmplatz. Over time it came to occupy a complex of buildings, including underground air-raid shelters built in 1940. Heavily damaged by Allied bombing, the site wound up in East Berlin in 1949. Portions of it served as the East German Railway headquarters until German Reunification in 1990.

Eighteen of the company's buildings have been registered as significant historic places by Heritage New Zealand. In 2006 an exhibition of their work was staged at The University of Auckland's Gus Fisher Gallery, and in 2007 the firm was described as 'the best architectural practice of all time in New Zealand'. When the partnership was established, Gummer was already a highly successful architect. In his early 20s he had travelled to England and there worked for Leonard Stokes and Edwin Lutyens. The latter architect, later known mostly for his memorial designs, 'profoundly influenced' Gummer He was placed third in a 1911 competition to design Parliament Buildings in London. After returning to New Zealand in 1914 he designed several well-regarded buildings including the New Zealand Insurance office in Auckland and the State Fire Insurance building in Wellington. The partnership between the two men was highly productive. Gummer's biographer in the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography attributes this to their complementary skills and personalities. Ford concentrated primarily on managing the practice and dealing with clients, although he also did some design work. Amongst the firm's early successes were Auckland's Dilworth Building, and the Auckland Railway Station, awarded a New Zealand Institute of Architects (NZIA) gold medal in 1931. The firm had earlier won a gold medal for the Remuera Public Library in 1928. Gummer and Ford designed numerous war memorials, including the New Zealand National War Memorial in Wellington, the Christchurch Bridge of Remembrance and the Dunedin Cenotaph. Gummer's school buildings include St Peter's College, Auckland (1939). They designed the Massey Memorial. Gummer was responsible for virtually all of the firm's iconic buildings but Ford also contributed significantly to New Zealand architecture and building through his book Earthquakes and Building Construction. He was also influential in the establishment of earthquake safety standards in New Zealand after the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake, and the establishment of a Chair of Architecture at Auckland University.

In Floer homology and its variants, chain complexes or differential graded algebras are generated by certain combinations of closed orbits of vector fields.

The differentials all count some flavor of pseudoholomorphic curves in a manifold with a cylindrical almost-complex structure whose ends at negative infinity are the given collection of closed orbits. For instance, in symplectic Floer homology, one considers the product of the mapping torus of a symplectomorphism with the real numbers; in symplectic field theory, one considers the symplectization of a contact manifold.
