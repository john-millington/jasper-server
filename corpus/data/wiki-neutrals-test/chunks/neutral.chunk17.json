A pedal tone has the pitch of its harmonic series' fundamental tone. Its name comes from the pedal keyboard pedals of a pipe organ, which are used to play 16' and 32' sub-bass notes. Cylindrical brasses do not naturally vibrate at this frequency. A closed cylinder vibrates at only the odd members of its harmonic series. This set of pitches is too sparse to be musically useful for brass instruments; therefore, the bells and mouthpieces of brasses are crafted to adjust these pitches. The bell significantly raises all pitches in the series, and the mouthpiece limits the amount to which higher harmonics are raised. The resulting set of pitches is a new harmonic series altogether. This new series has all but one of its members present, instead of only the odd members. The member not present in the new series is the fundamental. The original fundamental is not raised all the way to the new fundamental pitch, and the original third harmonic becomes the new second harmonic. The new fundamental can be played, however, as a pedal tone. The higher resonances of the new series help the lips vibrate at the fundamental frequency and allow the pitch to sound. The resulting tone relies heavily on overtones for its perception, but in the hands of a skilled player, pedal tones can be controlled and can sound characteristic to the instrument. Pedal tones are called for occasionally in advanced brass repertoire, particularly in that of the trombone and especially the bass trombone. Although not overly much used, pedal tones can often be played on a didgeridoo.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"James Sclavunos is an American drummer, multi-instrumentalist musician, record producer and writer.

The proposal drew public controversy after portions of Goodwin's speech which compared inner-city youth to primates in the jungle were leaked publically. The remarks were initially publicized by Peter Breggin, an outspoken opponent of psychiatric medication and biological explanations of crime. Goodwin first apologized for the primate remarks in an interview on February 21, calling them \"insensitive and careless.\" He resigned from his position on February 27, 1992. Further controversy arose when Breggin drew a connection between the Violence Initiative and Goodwin's earlier research into the use of psychiatric drugs as a means of controlling violent behavior, ultimately suggesting that the Violence Initiative would result in widespread use of psychiatric drugs to control the behavior of inner-city minority youth. Critics denounced the proposal as racist and called for it to be cancelled. Supporters of the proposal countered that the proposal had been a legitimate research topic, and had become a victim of \"political correctness.\"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"is a train station in Akashi, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The eleventh season of the long-running Australian medical drama All Saints began airing on 12 February 2008 and concluded with episode 40 on 25 November 2008.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Schitu is a commune in Olt County, Romania.

The effect is prominent in cyanobacteria, whereby the phycobilisome light-harvesting antenna complexes alter their preference for transfer of excitation energy between the two reaction centers, PS I and PS II. This shift helps to minimize photodamage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) under stressful conditions such as high light, but may also be used to offset imbalances between the rates of generating reductant and ATP. The phenomenon was first discovered in unicellular green algae, and may also occur in plants. However, in these organisms it occurs by a different mechanism, which is not as well understood. The plant/algal mechanism is considered functionally analogous to the cyanobacterial mechanism but involves completely different components. The foremost difference is the presence of fundamentally different types of light-harvesting antenna complexes: plants and green algae use an intrinsically-bound membrane complex of chlorophyll a/b binding proteins for their antenna, instead of the soluble phycobilisome complexes used by cyanobacteria (and certain algae).","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"is a Japanese actor who is affiliated with LesPros Entertainment.

He was the author of De mirabilibus mundi ('The wonders of the world') which circulated both under the title Collectanea rerum memorabilium ('Collection of Curiosities'), and Polyhistor; but the latter title was favoured by the author. The work is indeed a description of curiosities in a chorographical framework. Adventus, to whom it is dedicated, is identified with Oclatinius Adventus, consul 218. It contains a short description of the ancient world, with remarks on historical, social, religious and natural history questions. The greater part is taken from Pliny's Natural History and the geography of Pomponius Mela. According to Mommsen, Solinus also used a chronicle (possibly by Cornelius Bocchus) and a Chorographia pliniana, an epitome of Pliny's work with additions made about the time of Hadrian. Schanz, however, suggests the Roma and Prata of Suetonius. A greatly revised version of his original text was made, perhaps it is now thought by Solinus himself. This version contains a letter that Solinus wrote as an introduction to the work which gives the work the title Polyhistor ('multi-descriptive'). Both versions of the work circulated widely and eventually Polyhistor was taken for the author's name. It was popular in the Middle Ages, hexameter abridgments being current under the names of Theodericus and Petrus Diaconus.

The weapon was operated by a simple blowback system, which is very common for submachine guns. The unusual aspect of the weapon was the round itself. The weapon was chambered for the semi-caseless 9mm AUPO round. The AUPO was a much simpler system than the expensive and complicated advanced caseless round for the Heckler & Koch G11. The AUPO bullet had an elongated, hollow base that acted as the case. The propellant filled the hollow space, and was sealed into the bullet with a fulminate plug. The AUPO round was \"semi-caseless\" because the hollow base of the bullet detached from the bullet itself after firing. However, it was not necessary to eject it from the side of the weapon as in a normal cartridge, because the base followed the bullet down the barrel and exited at the muzzle, in a similar fashion to a sabot. This simplified the action of the weapon, allowing it to move back and draw another round from the magazine, since there was no case to eject. With the omission of the ejector mechanism and the ejection step in the action, there were fewer moving parts to jam and cause unreliable functioning of the weapon. The CB M2 never found any customers and the project was shelved.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Texas Emerging Technology Fund (often abbreviated as TETF or ETF) is a technology investment fund created by legislation in 2005 at the urging of Governor Rick Perry to provide Texas with an unparalleled advantage in the research, development, and commercialization of emerging technologies.

Lambert was born at Champigny-sur-Veude, France. He received his musical education as an altar boy at the Chapel of Gaston d'Orléans. He studied also with Pierre de Nyert in Paris. Since 1636, he was known as a singing teacher. In 1641, he married singer Gabrielle Dupuis who died suddenly a year later. Their daughter Madeleine became a wife of Jean-Baptiste Lully (in 1662). After his marriage, Lambert's career became closely linked to his sister-in-law and famous singer Hilaire Dupuy (1625-1709). In 1651, he appears as a ballet dancer at the court of Louis XIV. Beginning in 1656, his reputation as a composer was established and his compositions were regularly printed by Ballard. They consist mainly of airs on the poems of Benserade and Quinault. He was the most prolific composer of tunes in the second half of the seventeenth century. In 1661, he succeeded Jean de Cambefort as a maître de musique de la chambre du roi and kept this position until his death. In 1670, he became Kapellmeister. In that time, Lully was a superintendent of the royal music. Lambert's role as a singing master and composer of dramatic airs contributed to the creation of the French opera. As a singing master, he enjoyed a reputation attested by many testimonies of his time (including singers Anne de La Barre, Pierre Perrin, and La Cerf of Viéville). Titon du Tillet mentions concerts given in his house in Puteaux, during which Lambert himself accompanied on theorbo.

Lamirande first joined APTN in July 2000, working as a video journalist in APTN's Vancouver Bureau for four years before transferring to the Winnipeg Bureau and assuming the position of co-host.

The actions of the RCMP outraged the Canadian Journalists for Free Expression (CJFE).

If the rate of gene flow is high enough, then two populations are considered to have equivalent genetic diversity and therefore effectively a single population. It has been shown that it takes only \"One migrant per generation\" to prevent population diverging due to drift. Gene flow is an important mechanism for transferring genetic diversity among populations. Migrants into or out of a population may result in a change in allele frequencies (the proportion of members carrying a particular variant of a gene), changing the distribution of genetic diversity within the populations. Immigration may also result in the addition of new genetic variants to the established gene pool of a particular species or population. High rates of gene flow can reduce the genetic differentiation between the two groups, increasing homogeneity. For this reason,gene flow has been thought to constrain speciation by combining the gene pools of the groups, and thus, preventing the development of differences in genetic variation that would have led to full speciation. There are a number of factors that affect the rate of gene flow between different populations. Gene flow is expected to be lower in species that have low dispersal or mobility, occur in fragmented habitats, there is long distant between populations, and smaller populations sizes. Mobility plays an important role in the migration rate as a highly mobile individuals tend to have greater migratory prospect. Animals tend to be more mobile than plants, although pollen and seeds may be carried great distances by animals or wind. As dispersal distance decreases, gene flow is impeded and inbreeding, measured by the inbreeding coefficient (F), increases.For example, many island populations have low rates of gene flow due to geographically isolated and small population size. The Black Footed Rock Wallaby has several inbred populations that live on various islands off the coast of Australia. The population is so strongly isolated that gene flow is not a possibility leading to high occurrences of inbreeding.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The 6th Golden Raspberry Awards were held on March 23, 1986, at the Morgan-Wixon Theatre in Santa Monica, California, to recognize the worst the movie industry had to offer in 1985.

Prominent artists associated with minimalism include Donald Judd, John McCracken, Agnes Martin, Dan Flavin, Robert Morris, Anne Truitt, and Frank Stella. It derives from the reductive aspects of modernism and is often interpreted as a reaction against abstract expressionism and a bridge to postminimal art practices. Minimalism in music often features repetition and iteration such as those of the compositions of La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Julius Eastman, and John Adams. The term minimalist often colloquially refers to anything that is spare or stripped to its essentials. It has accordingly been used to describe the plays and novels of Samuel Beckett, the films of Robert Bresson, the stories of Raymond Carver, and the automobile designs of Colin Chapman. The word was first used in English in the early 20th century to describe a 1915 composition by the Russian painter Kasimir Malevich, Black Square.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Forensic palynology is the study of pollen, spores and other acid-resistant microscopic plant bodies, including dinoflagellates, to prove or disprove a relationship between objects, people and places that pertain to both criminal and civil cases. Pollen can tell a lot about where a person or object has been, because regions of the world, countries, and even different parts of a garden will have a distinctive pollen assemblage. Pollen evidence can also reveal the season in which a particular object picked up the pollen. Pollen has been used to trace activity at mass graves in Bosnia, catch a burglar who brushed against a Hypericum bush during a crime, and has even been proposed as an additive for bullets to enable tracking them. For instance, a dead body may be found in a wood, and the clothes may contain pollen that was released after death (the time of death can be determined by forensic entomology), but in a place other than where it was found. That indicates that the body was moved.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"David Byrne (born 1952) is a Scottish musician and former Talking Heads frontman.

Pressing the treadle pulls on a cord that is wrapped around the piece of wood or billet being turned. The other end of the cord reaches up to the end of a long springy pole. As the action is reciprocating, the work rotates in one direction and then back the other way. Cutting is only carried out on the down stroke of the treadle, the spring of the pole only being sufficient to return the treadle to the raised position ready for the next down stroke. Modern pole lathes often replace the springy pole with an elastic bungee cord. While the action of the pole lathe and the skills required are similar to those employed on a modern power lathe, a requirement is that the timber used on a pole lathe is freshly felled and unseasoned, i.e., green. The angle that the tools are ground is closer to that of a carpenter's chisel than that of a power lathe tool. Using power lathe tools on a pole lathe is safe, but hard work. Using a pole lathe chisel on a power lathe risks serious injury, since the forces are such that the blade is likely to break. The pole lathe's origin is lost in antiquity; it is known that Vikings used them from the archaeological finds at Jórvík, the Viking settlement discovered beneath the modern city of York in England. The use of pole lathes died out in England after World War II. It has seen a return through the increased interest in green woodwork, although the majority of practitioners are at the hobby rather than professional level. Around Britain there are regular courses for learning the art of pole lathe turning and associated skills, culminating in making chairs or simpler items.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Francis Giles (1787–1847) was a canal engineer and surveyor who worked under John Rennie and later became a railway engineer.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Mortehoe is a village and former manor on the north coast of Devon, England.

Integrating gives the vector area for the surface. For a curved or faceted surface, the vector area is smaller in magnitude than the area. As an extreme example, a closed surface can possess arbitrarily large area, but its vector area is necessarily zero. Surfaces that share a boundary may have very different areas, but they must have the same vector area—the vector area is entirely determined by the boundary. These are consequences of Stokes' theorem. The concept of an area vector simplifies the equation for determining the flux through the surface. Consider a planar surface in a uniform field. The flux can be written as the dot product of the field and area vector. This is much simpler than multiplying the field strength by the surface area and the cosine of the angle between the field and the surface normal.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"This is a list of Ambassadors and High Commissioners to and from New Zealand as of 24 July 2006.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Lord Altrie is a title in the Peerage of Scotland that was created on 29 July 1587 for Robert Keith.

At the same time the style forms part of the International Gothic style in its origins. The style was contemporaneous with several unique local styles of Gothic: the flamboyant in France, the perpendicular in England, the Manueline in Portugal, and the Isabelline in Spain. Like these, the Sondergotik showed an attention to detail both within and without. In many Sondergotik buildings, fluidity and a wood-like quality were stressed in carving and decoration, particularly on vaults. The rib patterns of Sondergotik vaults are elaborate and often curved (in plan), sometimes using broken and flying ribs (features extremely rare in other regions).
