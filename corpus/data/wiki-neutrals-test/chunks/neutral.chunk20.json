Instead the definitions merely compose other functions, among which are combinators that manipulate the arguments. Tacit programming is of theoretical interest, because the strict use of composition results in programs that are well adapted for equational reasoning. It is also the natural style of certain programming languages, including APL and its derivatives, and concatenative languages such as Forth. The lack of argument naming gives point-free style a reputation of being unnecessarily obscure, hence the epithet \"pointless style.\" UNIX scripting uses the paradigm with pipes. For example, a sequence of operations in an applicative language like the following: into computer functions, where the left represents the uncurried form of a function and the right the curried.

As is common with the passage of time, the name \"Tennally\" evolved into the name \"Tenley.\" The name change was relatively gradual and historic photos of the District's streetcar system have indicated that streetcars of the period were signed with the original spelling. The circle is bounded by St. Ann Catholic Church, a large imposing stone church, American University's Washington College of Law, and Wisconsin Avenue Baptist Church. The circle is an important transportation hub for area residents, featuring stops for the Washington Metro's 30N, 30S, 31, 33, 37, 96, H2, H3, H4, N2, and M4 bus routes. The Tenleytown–AU Metro station is one block north of the circle, where one is able to catch a free shuttle to the main campus of American University a little less than a mile away.

According to Bruno Migliorini, the poet also hailed from the Marche, and according to its first editor, Gianfranco Contini, the Ritmo is composed in \"a koiné of East Central Italy, whose cultural capital was undoubtedly Montecassino.\" It has thus many affinities with the Ritmo cassinese: written about the same time (broadly) in the same region, metrically and linguistically similar, Benedictine in religion, and both monastic in provenance and giullaresco in style, designed for popular audience and public performance. The Ritmo is divided into twenty-seven stanzas of varied length. Each stanza opens with four to thirteen monorhyming octonaries or novenaries and closes with a deca- or hendecasyllabic couplet of a different rhyme, often rich or homonymic. The discrepancies and irregularities in the prosody may be attributed to the copyist, but also to the numerous Latinisms and Gallicisms. As it stands the Ritmo is incomplete, stopping abruptly after 257 slow-paced lines, just before the arrival of Euphemian's servants at Edessa. It does encompass Alexius' birth, marriage, exhortations to his wife, flight to Laodicea, and the beginnings of his mendicancy.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS) is an umbrella organization for national operations research societies of over 45 countries from four geographical regions: Asia Pacific, Europe, North America, and South America.

The story follows Phoenix Wright, a rookie defense attorney who attempts to get his clients declared \"not guilty\". Among other characters are Phoenix's boss, Mia Fey; his assistant and Mia's sister, Maya; and prosecutor Miles Edgeworth. The player controls Phoenix through two types of sections: investigations and courtroom trials. During investigations, they gather information and evidence, and during trials, they cross-examine witnesses and answer questions from the judge, the prosecutor, and the witnesses. The story is split into five cases, the fifth being introduced in the Nintendo DS version to take advantage of gameplay elements using the handheld's touchscreen and not available in the original Game Boy Advance version. Development of the game was handled by a team of seven people over the course of ten months. It was directed and written by Shu Takumi, and was originally planned to be a Game Boy Color game about a private investigator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. While the original version of the game takes place in Japan, the localization is set in the United States; this became an issue when localizing later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious. The game has been mostly positively received by critics, who have appreciated its premise, writing, characters and presentation. The game has been a commercial success both in Japan and internationally, with the North American release selling higher than expectations and being hard to find in stores shortly after release. Other media based on the game has been made: a manga series premiered in 2006; a film adaptation of the game, titled Ace Attorney, premiered in 2012; and an anime series adaptation started airing in 2016.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Star Cinema is a movie theater chain owned by AGT Enterprises, Inc., of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, with nine locations in the states of Iowa and Wisconsin in the United States of America.

Signed by Chesterfield in May of that year, Holmes remained with the Derbyshire club for just one season before being signed by Division One side Sheffield United in May 1931 for £1,750. Making his debut for United in October 1931 in an away fixture at Manchester City, Holmes became a regular in the Blades defence for the next four years. Holmes was regarded as a robust and tough tackling defender with a fiery temper, highlighted when a referee ruled out a goal Holmes had scored, only for the defender to pick up the official and \"shake him like a dog would a rat\" according to press reports. Having missed very few fixtures, Holmes was sidelined by injury at the start of the 1935–36 season and was replaced by Tom Johnson. Despite Holmes regaining his fitness, Johnson's impressive form meant that by December 1935 he was firmly established as first choice, resulting in Holmes making only occasional appearances from then on. In May 1936 Holmes moved to West Ham United for £750 where he played for a season, before joining Reading in July 1937.

In general, compound bows are widely used in target practice and hunting. The pulley/cam system grants the user a mechanical advantage, and so the limbs of a compound bow are much stiffer than those of a recurve bow or longbow. This rigidity makes the compound bow more energy-efficient than other bows, as less energy is dissipated in limb movement. The higher-rigidity, higher-technology construction also improves accuracy by reducing the bow's sensitivity to changes in temperature and humidity. The pulley/cam system also confers a benefit called \"let-off.\" As the string is drawn back, the cams rotate. The cams are eccentric rather than round, and so their effective radius changes as they rotate. Each of a compound bow's two cams features two tracks: an inner track which connects to the opposite limb or opposite cam through cables, and an outer track through which the bowstring runs. As the bow is drawn, the ratio of bowstring pay-out and cable take-up relative to limb-weight and leverage of the cams changes. By manipulation of the shapes of these cam tracks, different draw-stroke profiles can be created. A compound bow can be soft-drawing with a slow build-up to peak weight and a gradual let-off with a long \"valley\" at the end. It can also be hard-drawing with a very fast build-up to peak draw-weight, a long plateau where weight is maintained, and a quick let-off with a short valley. The let-off itself is the result of the cam profiles having passed center and approaching a condition very similar to a cam-lock. In some compound bows, if the draw-stops or draw-length modules are removed, they will self-lock at full draw and require professional equipment to unlock safely. The compound bow was first developed in 1966 by Holless Wilbur Allen in Billings, Missouri, and a US patent was granted in 1969. The compound bow has become increasingly popular. In the United States, the compound is the dominant form of bow. In literature of the early 20th century, before the invention of compound bows, composite bows were described as \"compound\". This usage is now outdated.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The year 1999 in architecture involved some significant architectural events and new buildings.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Slobodni tjednik, also known as ST, is a defunct Croatian weekly magazine which was published in Zagreb in the early 1990s.

Schooling in Kenya, he completed his higher education in South Africa, and obtained BSc in Medical Science from the University of the Witwatersrand in 1947. He earned DPhil from the University of Oxford in 1950. After working at the Radcliffe Infirmary for two years, he worked as post-doctoral student to Linus Pauling in 1954. After teaching medicine for three years at Oxford, he worked at the Medical Research Council in London. From 1978 he simultaneously worked at the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases (ILRAD) as its Director, and at the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Immunology Laboratory, both in Nairobi. He became the Vice President for Research at Syntex Corporation in 1981 till 1994. While a graduate student at Oxford, Allison joined a vocational Oxford University Expedition to Mount Kenya in 1949. He first noticed from blood samples he collected that there was an unusually high occurrence of sickle-cell trait in its less harmful (heterozygous) condition. He conceived the idea that it could be an advantageous adaptation to people constantly exposed to malaria. After he completed his doctoral research at Oxford in 1953, he investigated further. In 1954 he discovered, confirming his preconception, that people with sickle-cell trait are resistant to the deadly falciparum malaria. In the 1970s, Allison had worked out the enzyme, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, as a key molecule of the immune response in autoimmune diseases and in organ transplantation. Based on this, he tested the otherwise abandoned antibiotic, mycophenolate mofetil, as an inhibitor of the enzyme. After experimental success, with his wife, Elsie M. Eugui, he developed a safer derivative which was eventually approved as an immunosuppressive drug called CellCept. He contributed more that 400 technical papers and edited 12 books.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"2 Reconnaissance Regiment was the Active Citizen Force unit of the South African Special Forces.

They are classified as a subgroup of the much larger and more developed Austronesian family, belonging to the Oceanic branch of that family. There are approximately forty Polynesian languages. The most prominent of these are Tahitian, Sāmoan, Tongan, Māori and Hawaiian. Because the Polynesian islands were settled relatively recently and because internal linguistic diversification only began around 2,000 years ago, their languages retain strong commonalities. There are still many cognate words across the different islands e.g. tapu, ariki, motu, kava (Kava culture), and tapa as well as Hawaiki, the mythical homeland for some of the cultures. All Polynesian languages show strong similarity, particularly in vocabulary. The vowels are often stable in the descendant languages, nearly always a, e, i, o and u. The legendary homeland of the Māori of New Zealand, where w is used instead of v, is called Hawaiki; in the Cook Islands, where h is replaced with the glottal stop, it is 'Avaiki; in the Hawaiian Islands, where w is used and k is replaced with the glottal stop, the largest island of the group is named Hawai'i; in Sāmoa, where s has not been replaced by h, v is used instead of w, and k is replaced with the glottal stop, the largest island is called Savai'i.

It was the dominant means for front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout cars in the 20th century. The name comes from the French automobile firm of Hotchkiss, although it is clear that other makers (such as Peerless) used similar systems before Hotchkiss. During the early part of the 20th century chain-drive power transmission was the main direct drive competitor of the Hotchkiss system, with the torque tube also popular until the 1950s. Most shaft-drive systems consist of a drive shaft (also called a \"propeller shaft\" or Cardan shaft) extending from the transmission in front to the differential in the rear. The differentiating characteristic of the Hotchkiss drive is the fact that it uses universal joints at both ends of the driveshaft, which is not enclosed. The use of two universal joints, properly phased and with parallel alignment of the drive and driven shafts, allows the use of simple cross-type universals. In contrast, a torque tube arrangement uses only a single universal at the end of the transmission tailshaft, typically a constant velocity joint. In the Hotchkiss drive, slip-splines or a plunge-type (ball and trunnion u-joint) eliminate thrust transmitted back up the driveshaft from the axle, allowing simple rear-axle positioning using parallel leaf springs. In the torque-tube type this thrust is taken by the torque tube to the transmission and thence to the transmission and motor mounts to the frame. While the torque-tube type requires additional locating elements, such as a Panhard rod, this allows the use of coil springs. Some Hotchkiss driveshafts are made in two pieces with another universal joint in the center for greater flexibility, typically in trucks and specialty vehicles built on truck frames. Some installations use rubber mounts to isolate noise and vibration. The 1984–1987 RWD Toyota Corolla (i.e., Corolla SR5 and GT-S) coupe is another example of a car that uses a 2-part Hotchkiss driveshaft with a rubber-mounted center bearing. This design was the main form of power transmission for most cars from the 1920s through the 1970s. As of 2016 it remains common in pick-up trucks, and sport utility vehicles. There is no connection between The Hotchkiss drive and the modern suspension-modification company Hotchkis.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"A knock-for-knock agreement is an agreement between two insurance companies whereby, when both companies' policy-holders incur losses in the same insured event (usually a motor accident), each insurer pays the losses sustained by its own policy-holder regardless of who was responsible.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":":Not to be confused with modern big-bore air rifles by Dennis Quackenbush The Quackenbush rifle, invented by industrialist Henry M.

It was first broadcast on Telefís Éireann in Ireland on 10 April 1966 and later on the BBC in the United Kingdom, ABC in Australia and several other European countries. Only one series of eight episodes was made, with each episode broadcast on consecutive nights. The series was repeated only once when, on 1 May 1966, it was shown in its entirety. The series portrays the 1916 Easter Rising which was mounted by Irish republicans to end British rule in Ireland and establish an independent Irish Republic. The events were reconstructed as it might have been seen by an Irish television service at the time. Ray McAnally acted as the studio anchor of a news programme that presented daily coverage of the Rising as it unfolded, with Telefís Éireann reporters broadcasting on the spot updates of the events and conducting interviews with key participants. Along with the key figures of the insurrection, the series also looked at the action in the General Post Office, Liberty Hall and events like the Battle of Mount Street Bridge. Incidents outside Dublin such as the arrest of Roger Casement, the sinking of the Aud and the battle of Ashbourne were introduced into the programmes as filmed news items of the day. McAnally interviewed guests in studio and also used models and street maps to clarify details for the viewers. Insurrection has received critical acclaim from television critics. Described in the RTV Guide as \"undoubtedly the most difficult and ambitious project ever attempted by Irish television\", the series formed the centrepiece of Telefís Éireann's 1916 golden jubilee commemoration. It was regarded as pioneering in its use of the outside broadcast unit to record drama on location and its presentation of an historical event in the style of modern TV war reporting. This technique was borrowed from the 1964 BBC TV film Culloden. On 8 March 2016, RTÉ announced that Insurrection would be rebroadcast as part of their 1916 centenary commemoration.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Faccioli is an Italian surname.

It is unknown whether or not she was ever physically involved with the monarch. She was the daughter of Marshal Baron Charles De Geer and Catharina Charlotta Ribbing and married Lieutenant Anders Rudolf du Rietz in 1765. She is described as a well-educated and cultivated intellectual, with an interest in chemistry. In February 1768, it was noted that Charlotte Du Rietz and Eva Helena Löwen flirted with Crown Prince Gustav and attempted to seduce him. Eventually, he succumbed to the advances of the former. From July to September 1768, Charlotte and Crown Prince Gustav were involved in a strong emotional friendship. This has been referred to as the only love affair Gustav III ever had. The relationship mostly took place by a correspondence of love letters during the summer of 1768. At the same time, Gustav was under pressure to consummate his marriage to Sophia Magdalena of Denmark at his summer residence Ekolsund Castle, and he was blamed for his flirtation by Charlotta Sparre. In September, Gustav made an official inspection-journey through Bergslagen and visited Lövstad Castle, the childhood home of Du Rietz, where he ended their flirtation after he heard rumors that she had more lovers. He wrote his farewell letter in October, when he met her in Uppsala. The real nature of the relationship has been debated, with no specific conclusions of fact available. In October, there were false rumors that Sophia Magdalena was pregnant, while in reality the marriage was still not consummated. After the relationship with Du Rietz ended, Gustav suggested a love affair to Eva Helena Löwen, but she refused with the motivation that his infatuation for her was surely but a whim of wounded self pride, and although she could love him, she could not come between him and her own future Queen. The statement about the consummation of the marriage of Gustav III made by Adolf Fredrik Munck describes the sexual history of Gustav III and thereby also the character of his relationship with Charlotte Du Rietz. In his statement, Munck reports that Gustav had only one partner before Charlotte Du Rietz, \"the wife of an English sea captain,\" in Gothenburg in 1766, but neither in that case nor in the relationship with Charlotte Du Rietz was there apparently any other physical contact than touching \"without effect\". This was the reason that the most famous courtesan of Stockholm, Catharina Norman, was hired in 1771 to remove the king's virginity. After her meeting with the monarch, Catharina Norman reported that: \"His Majesty is terribly shy and utterly unuse to it\", and that it had not been possible to perform intercourse. The relationship between Charlotte Du Rietz and Gustav III was therefore likely not sexually consummated. Correspondence between Du Rietz and Gustav III is kept at Uppsala University Library.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Robert Alan Cassevah (born September 11, 1985) is a professional baseball pitcher.

The programme was the first BBC-produced, in-depth documentary chronicling Doctor Who since the earlier Whose Doctor Who was broadcast in April 1977, although a thirty-minute, categorized compilation of archive clips had been broadcast in 1992 on BBC2 entitled Resistance is Useless. The show featured many clips from episodes of the show transmitted to date, along with interviews with members of the cast and crew. Several iconic scenes from the show's history were recreated using a young actor (Josh Maguire) playing the part of a child imagining himself involved in the settings. Some of the interviewees included: Carole Ann Ford, Verity Lambert, Roberta Tovey, Jennie Linden, William Hartnell's granddaughter Jessica Carney, Deborah Watling, Frazer Hines, Nicholas Courtney, Jon Pertwee, Elisabeth Sladen, Colin Baker, Nicola Bryant, Sylvester McCoy, Sophie Aldred & Alan Yentob. The show was never repeated on the BBC, but an expanded version premiered at BAFTA on 5 November 1994, titled Even More Than Thirty Years in the TARDIS. This was followed by a release on VHS, titled More Than... Thirty Years in the TARDIS, this version ran to 90 minutes and included many interviews and clips not featured in the broadcast version. In 2013, More Than... Thirty Years in the TARDIS was released on DVD, as part of The Legacy Collection box set alongside the uncompleted 1979 Doctor Who serial Shada. The programme was produced and directed by Kevin Davies, with Sue Kerr as Executive Producer. Davies's initial idea for the programme had been a part-documentary, part-drama called The Legend Begins, which would have mixed interviews with those responsible for the creation of Doctor Who with a dramatised strand showing how these events took place. This later evolved into a proposal called Eulogy for the Doctor, which would have featured several actors who had appeared in the series as the Doctor's companions returning to their roles for a drama linking between archive clips from the series. Eventually, all of these ideas were scaled-down or abandoned in favour of a more straightforward documentary format. The idea of a drama depicting the origins of Doctor Who would, however, later be used for the programme's fiftieth anniversary in 2013, when the one-off special An Adventure in Space and Time was broadcast on BBC Two.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The CANSA FC.20 was a twin engine reconnaissance bomber/ground attack monoplane designed and built in Italy in 1941.

They are distinct from other cell populations such as neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and neural stem cells and are recognized as the fourth major glial cell type in the mammalian CNS. Studies have implicated polydendrocytes in many cellular and physiological processes. Polydendrocytes in the postnatal mouse CNS and those grown in culture generate oligodendrocytes, and thus they are often equated with oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Under some culture conditions, polydendrocytes give rise to astrocytes. A subpopulation of polydendrocytes in the gray matter of the embryonic CNS also generates protoplasmic astrocytes. In addition, polydendrocytes express receptors for various neurotransmitters and undergo membrane depolarization when they receive synaptic inputs from neurons.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The 1910 Iowa Hawkeyes football team represented the University of Iowa in the 1910 college football season.

Eighteen Bolsheviks attended, although Joseph Stalin and Yakov Sverdlov, who were in exile at the time, were not able to. Georgi Plekhanov claimed he was too ill to attend. At the conference, Vladimir Lenin and his supporters broke away from the rest of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and formed their own, Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks). The conference was meant to be secret; Lenin had instructed: \"No-one, no organisation must know about this\". However, every detail was known to the Okhrana, the secret police of the Russian Empire. Seven people were elected to the Central Committee: Lenin, Zinoviev, Malinovsky (later revealed to be a spy for the Okhrana), Ordzhonikidze, Spandaryan (Stalin's best friend), Sverdlov (Soviet president, 1917–19) and Goloshchekin. The latter four set up a Russian Bureau to direct the party along with Kalinin and Stalin, who led the Bureau. This ensured the domination of Russia-based Bolsheviks as opposed to the émigrés who were considered \"null and void\" by Ordzhonikidze. Spandaryan called for the émigré group to be dissolved. After the conference, upon Lenin and Zinoviev's recommendation, Stalin was co-opted to the Bolshevik Central Committee. Elena Stasova was made Secretary to the Russian Bureau. Stepan Shahumyan and Mikhail Kalinin (Soviet president 1919–46) became candidate Central Committee members. Ironically, Kalinin was suspected of being an Okhrana agent so was not a full member.

In this respect it is a modern version of an armor-piercing shell. The ammunition may also be called semi-armor-piercing high-explosive incendiary (SAPHEI). Typical of a modern HEIAP shell is the Raufoss Mk 211 .50 BMG round designed for weapons such as heavy machine guns and anti-materiel rifles. The primary purpose of these munitions is armor penetration with better beyond armor effects . Similarly to SLAP rounds (saboted light armor penetrator) which get their armor-piercing ability from the propulsion of a 7.62mm tungsten heavy alloy bullet from a 12.7mm barrel (.50 caliber) using a sabot with much more energy than is usually possible from a 7.62mm round, HEIAP munitions utilize a similar theory with an added explosive effect at the end.The special effect is developed when the round strikes the target. The initial collision ignites the incendiary material in the tip, triggering the detonation of the HE charge. The second (zirconium powder) incendiary charge will also ignite. This burns at a very high temperature, is not easily extinguished, and can last up to 15 minutes. The remaining element of the round is the tungsten carbide penetrator. This has a large amount of kinetic energy and will penetrate the armor as a solid-cored armor-piercing shot would. This will take the incendiary material and about 20 steel fragments (created by the explosives) delivering them in a 25–30 degree cone through the armor increasing lethality. The triggering of the explosive charge is dependent upon the resistance of the target. If the target offers little resistance then the lack of frictional heating will prevent the incendiary from igniting and the high explosive from detonating. Larger guns such as the British 30 mm RARDEN cannon fire APSE (armor-piercing special effects) shells which are an armor-piercing round with an added HE effect.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Natibpur is a census town in Domjur (community development block) under Domjur police station in Sadar subdivision of Howrah district in the Indian state of West Bengal.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"WhenU Save/SaveNow (commonly referred to simply as WhenU or SaveNow), developed by the company WhenU, is a piece of advertising software generally considered to be adware or spyware.

The liquid component of the drilling fluid (known as the mud filtrate, or spurt) continues to \"invade\" the porous and permeable formation until the solids present in the mud, commonly bentonite, clog enough pores to form a mud cake capable of preventing further invasion. If invasion is severe enough, and reservoir pressures are unable to force the fluid and associated particles out entirely when the well starts producing, the amount of oil and gas a well can produce can be permanently reduced. This is especially true when a process called phase trapping occurs. This is when a fluid enters a formation that is below its irreducible saturation of that fluid. Once the fluid is present, it is held in place by capillary forces and usually can not be removed. Invasion also has significant implications for well logging. In many cases the \"depth of investigation\" of a well logging tool is only a few inches (or even less for methods such as sonic logs), and it is quite possible that drilling fluid has invaded beyond this depth. In these cases readings are strongly influenced by mud filtrate properties rather than pure formation (in situ) properties. This influence must be considered when interpreting the resulting logs.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Francys Arsentiev (January 18, 1958 – May 24, 1998) became the first woman from the United States to reach the summit of Mount Everest without the aid of bottled oxygen, on May 22, 1998.

Following the development of modern trampolines in the USA by George Nissen, Ted Blake was a major contributor to their nascence in the United Kingdom and in developing International Competition for trampolining. In his early years Blake went to the Latymer School in London and on leaving there held a variety of jobs before joining the army in 1939. During war years he trained as a Physical Training Instructor, transferring from the Essex Regiment to the Army Physical Training Corps in 1941 and rose to the rank of Company Sergeant Major Instructor (CSMI) by the time of his discharge in 1946. For most of his army life Blake was based at the Essex Regiment's depot at Brentwood. Having left the army, Blake spent the next 3 years attending courses to become a teacher. Starting out at the Loxford School in Ilford, Essex in 1949 he soon introduced a single second-hand Nissen trampoline. Whilst at the Loxford School, Blake developed a trampoline squad of sufficient skill that they were invited to do a demonstration at the Festival of Britain in 1951. Blake remained at Loxford School until 1956 when he left to establish the UK operation of Nissen. Blake subsequently became Managing Director for the Nissen UK business based at their factory in Hutton Industrial Estate, Brentwood, Essex. Together with Kurt Baechler of Switzerland, Blake was credited with the introduction of trampolining to Europe. Being passionate about trampolining he was not only involved in their commercial development but heavily involved in developing the competitive trampolining framework we see today. It is likely that Blake was heavily involved in the UK National Championships which are credited, in 1958, with being the first televised national championships. In 1964 Blake organised the first World Championships (financed by George Nissen) which were held in the Royal Albert Hall, London. That same year, following these first World Championships, he attended an inaugural meeting of prominent trampolinists in Frankfurt to discuss the formation of an International Trampoline Federation. This was launched as the (FIT) in Twickenham in 1965 and Blake became its first Vice-President, a position he held until 1967. So influential was Blake at the time that three of the first four World Championships were organised by him and held in London - at this time they took place every year. Having delivered at the Senior level, Blake continued to be heavily involved in promoting competition, and in 1973 working with Bob Bollinger and George Nissen created the World Age Group Competition, which now runs alongside the World Championships every two years. Blake appeared, however, to not always be comfortable with authority and in 1972 was scathing about the FIT he had originally developed, questioning why it was so bureaucratic and gymnastics oriented in an international publication of that time. One of few Britons so honoured, in 1976 he was recognised by the United States Trampoline & Tumbling Association for his major influence on developing modern trampolining by being added to their Hall of Fame. Blake left Nissen in mid-1980 having spent many years staving off the pressure from Nissen's then-owners to cease manufacturing trampolines because of fears of litigation. They had previously ceased manufacture in USA many years before for this very reason. Blake continued to give talks and lectures, however and soon became a leading light in the UK Leisure Management Industry.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Andrew Finlay (born 10 February 1901; date of death unknown) was a Scottish footballer who played as a forward for Port Vale, Airdrieonians, Manchester City, Crewe Alexandra, Third Lanark, Dundee United and Hibernian in the 1920s.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Wymykowo () is a settlement in the administrative district of Gmina Przelewice, within Pyrzyce County, West Pomeranian Voivodeship, in north-western Poland.

Matthew's Gospel adds a prediction, before he and his disciples enter Jerusalem, that he will be crucified there. In the Gospel of Mark, generally agreed to be the earliest Gospel, written around the year 70, Jesus predicts his death three times. Walter Schmithals, noting that this Gospel also contains verses in which Jesus appears to predict his Passion, suggests that these represent the earlier traditions available to the author, and the three death predictions are redactional creations of the author. The setting for the first prediction is somewhere near Caesarea Philippi, immediately after Peter proclaims Jesus as the Messiah. Jesus tells his followers that \"the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again\". When Peter objects, Jesus tells him: \"Get behind me, Satan! You do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men\". ()The Gospel of includes this episode, saying that Jesus \"from that time\", i.e. on a number of occasions, Jesus \"began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed ...\". The Gospel of shortens the account, dropping the dialogue between Jesus and Peter. Each time Jesus predicts his arrest and death, the disciples in some way or another manifest their incomprehension, and Jesus uses the occasion to teach them new things. The second warning appears in (and also in ) as follows: He said to them, \"The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise.\" But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it. The third prediction in the specifically mentions crucifixion: Now as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside and said to them, \"We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. On the third day he will be raised to life!\" The fourth prediction in Matthew is found in Matthew 26:1-2 immediately precedes the plot made against him by the religious Jewish leaders: \"As you know, the Passover is two days away—and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.\" The hypothetical Q source, widely considered by scholars to be a collection of sayings of Jesus used, in addition to the Gospel of Mark, by the authors of the Luke and Matthew Gospels, contains no predictions of the death of Jesus. The Gospel of John, in chapters 12 to 17, also mentions several occasions where Jesus prepared his disciples for his departure, which the gospel also refers to as his \"glorification\": Jesus answered them, saying, “The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified.

Jaimal's name is commonly mentioned with the brave leader Patta. These two were given the command of the army when Udai Singh, along with the royal family, left the fort and retired to Gogunda. Their bravery was such that Akbar himself ordered the construction of their statues outside his fort in Agra to honour their bravery and courage. ''\"At this time H.M.(Akbar) perceived that a person clothed in a cuirass known as the hazār mīkhī (thousand nails) which is a mark of chieftainship among them, came to the breach and superintended the proceedings. It was not known who he was. H.M. took his gun Sangrām, which is one of the special guns, and aimed it at him..... And in fact on the morning when the breeze of victory and dominion arose, it was ascertained that the Shāhinshāh's musket had reached Jaimal, the governor of the fort, and had at once destroyed both him and the fort.\"'' ~ The death of Jaimal, Akbarnama by Abu'l Fazl His son, Ramdas Rathore went on to fight in the Battle of Haldighati, where he was slain by Jagannath Kachhwa.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Janet Kigusiuq (b. 1926 Putuqsuqniq camp, near Garry Lake, Nunavut; d. 2005 Baker Lake, Nunavut) was an Inuit artist. Kigusiuq's drawings focused on camp life, hunting and fishing. The source of these motifs are principally drawn from childhood experiences at the family camp, Kitikat in the Back River region. She adopted printmaking following the family's move to Baker Lake and between 1970 and 1988 she contributed to the Baker Lake print collections. Her mature work saw the development of pencil crayon colour fields and collage techniques, the latter prompted by the onset of arthritis. Kigusiuq came from a large family of artists: she was the eldest daughter of Jessie Oonark, her siblings included artists Victoria Mamnguqsualuk, Nancy Pukingrnak, Peggy Qablunaaq Aittauq, Mary Yuusipik Singaqti, Josiah Nuilaalik, Miriam Marealik Qiyuk and William Noah, and she was married to Mark Uqayuittuq, son of Luke Anguhadluq, themselves both artists.

The pens are typically located in the relatively shallow waters of sheltered areas, such as bays or coves. Tuna penning is primarily used for Atlantic Bluefin Tuna (ABT), a highly profitable stock for the global fish market. The tuna caught for penning are typically caught between May and July by purse-seine vessels, and then transported back to pens, where they are fattened until October–January before being frozen and shipped out. While in the pens, the tuna are fed primarily fresh fish, such as sardines, squid, and mackerel. In the past decade, tuna penning has become a large sector within the fish aquaculture industry, and takes place primarily in the Mediterranean. In 2010, ABT constituted 8% of global fish exports, the majority of which was shipped to Japan. Tuna penning is regulated by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), and each farm is required to register both the number of tuna it has and the total capacity of the farm.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Holding the Fort is a short American silent comedy produced by the Edison Company in 1912.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The 1977 Rugby League World Cup Final was the conclusive game of the 1977 Rugby League World Cup tournament and was played between Australia and Great Britain on 25 June 1977 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Australia.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Auburn River Dam is a possible future reservoir located on the Auburn River near Mundubbera, Queensland.

Its name is Latin for the crane, a type of bird. It is one of twelve constellations conceived by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. Grus first appeared on a 35-cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and was depicted in Johann Bayer's star atlas Uranometria of 1603. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille gave Bayer designations to its stars in 1756, some of which had been previously considered part of the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus. The constellations Grus, Pavo, Phoenix and Tucana are collectively known as the \"Southern Birds\". The constellation's brightest star, Alpha Gruis, is also known as Alnair and appears as a 1.7-magnitude blue-white star. Beta Gruis is a red giant variable star with a minimum magnitude of 2.3 and a maximum magnitude of 2.0. Six star systems have been found to have planets: the red dwarf Gliese 832 is one of the closest stars to Earth to have a planetary system. Another—WASP-95—has a planet that orbits every two days. Deep-sky objects found in Grus include the planetary nebula IC 5148, also known as the Spare Tyre Nebula, and a group of four interacting galaxies known as the Grus Quartet.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The GD Graphics Library is a graphics software library by Thomas Boutell and others for dynamically manipulating images. Its native programming language is ANSI C, but it has interfaces for many other programming languages. It can create GIFs, JPEGs, PNGs, and WBMPs. Support for drawing GIFs was dropped in 1999 when Unisys revoked the royalty-free license granted to non-commercial software projects for the LZW compression method used by GIFs. When the Unisys patent expired worldwide on July 7, 2004, GIF support was subsequently re-enabled. GD originally stood for \"GIF Draw\". However, since the revoking of the Unisys license, it has informally stood for \"Graphics Draw\". GD can create images composed of lines, arcs, text (using program-selected fonts), other images, and multiple colors. Version 2.0 adds support for truecolor images, alpha channels, resampling (for smooth resizing of truecolor images), and many other features. GD supports numerous programming languages including C, PHP, Perl, Python, OCaml, Tcl, Lua, Pascal, GNU Octave, REXX, Ruby and Go. In addition, the \"Fly\" command line interpreter allows for image creation (\"on the fly\") using GD. GD scripts can thus be written in potentially any language and run using this tool. GD is extensively used with PHP, where a modified version supporting additional features is included by default as of PHP 4.3 and was an option before that. As of PHP 5.3, a system version of GD may be used as well, to get the additional features that were previously available only to the bundled version of GD.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Luca Ghini (Casalfiumanese 1490 – Bologna, May 4, 1556) was an Italian physician and botanist, notable as the creator of the first recorded herbarium, as well as the first botanical garden in Europe. Ghini was born in Casalfiumanese, son of a notary, and studied medicine at the University of Bologna. By 1527 he was lecturing there on medicinal plants, and eventually became a professor. He moved to Pisa in 1544, while maintaining his home in Bologna. He created the first herbarium (hortus siccus) in that year, drying plants while pressing them between pieces of paper, then gluing them to cardboard. None of his herbaria survive although the one by his student Gherardo Cibo made around 1532 survives. 1544 also saw the establishment of a garden for live plants, which became known as the Orto botanico di Pisa. Ghini published no significant botanical work of his own, but was noted as a teacher many of whose students went on to significant careers, including Cesalpino (his successor at the herbariuim) and Pietro Andrea Mattioli, the latter of which he helped by travelling around the Mediterranean and Near East in search for plants that matched the mystifying descriptions of Dioscorides. A Placiti describing Ghini's travels was published posthumously.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Chesterville may refer to:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Rising Sun Pictures (RSP) is an Australian-based visual effects company.
