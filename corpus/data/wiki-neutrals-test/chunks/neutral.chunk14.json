They soon bonded over their love of Silverchair. Initially with Shimon on drums and Emma on guitars, the duo would frequently meet up to play Green Day, Rage Against the Machine, and Silverchair songs, and eventually felt compelled to write their own material. When Chris Mileski joined the band to play drums, Emma switched to bass and Shimon to guitar and vocals, and they became Sick Puppies. There are two stories as to how the band name was conceived. The official version is that Shimon Moore thought of the name himself when the band members were brainstorming, and then came home a few days later to find his father Phil reading the book Sick Puppy by Carl Hiaasen. The alternate version is that a neighbor's dog entered the garage during a rehearsal and vomited on their equipment. An early fan made the comment, \"That's one sick puppy\", and the name stuck. Emma Anzai took up a job as a telemarketer and Shimon took a job holding a sandwich board in the Pitt Street Mall in Sydney, Australia. Through their own financing and with help from Shimon's father (a musician and producer), the band released their debut EP ''Dog's Breakfast''.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Arnold Schwarzenegger is an Austrian actor who has appeared in over 30 films, and has also ventured into directing and producing.

It was sold locally but also in New Zealand and South Africa, with smaller numbers also exported to South-East Asia and the United Kingdom. Parent company Chrysler made a substantial investment in Australian manufacturing facilities, by establishing operations in South Australia with an assembly plant at Tonsley Park in 1964 and an engine foundry at Lonsdale in 1968. The Valiant thus established its position as the third of the \"Big 3\" Australian-made vehicles behind the Holden Kingswood and Ford Falcon. The Australian Valiant was built on the North American A-body platform but with many parts and components from Australian suppliers. Apart from a sedan and wagon body style, 1965 saw the introduction of a commercial utility that was badged the Wayfarer and later exported to South Africa as the Rustler.

They can be used in general industry assessments, or for more specific application in assessing capabilities of possible suppliers. The Government Accountability Office has described it as best practice for improving acquisition outcomes. The United States Department of Defense adopted the usage of MRLs in 2005, but the GAO continued to note inconsistent application across DOD components. In 2011, consideration of manufacturing readiness and related processes of potential contractors and subcontractors was made mandatory as part of the source selection process in major acquisition programs. MRLs are quantitative measures used to assess the maturity of a given technology, component or system from a manufacturing perspective. They are used to provide decision makers at all levels with a common understanding of the relative maturity and attendant risks associated with manufacturing technologies, products, and processes being considered. Manufacturing risk identification and management must begin at the earliest stages of technology development, and continue vigorously throughout each stage of a program’s life-cycles. Manufacturing readiness level definitions were developed by a joint DOD/industry working group under the sponsorship of the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP). The intent was to create a measurement scale that would serve the same purpose for manufacturing readiness as Technology Readiness Levels serve for technology readiness – to provide a common metric and vocabulary for assessing and discussing manufacturing maturity, risk and readiness. MRLs were designed with a numbering system to be roughly congruent with comparable levels of TRLs for synergy and ease of understanding and use.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Abludomelita obtusata is a brown colored species of amphipod crustacean.

The vehicle was given its present name by President Yudhoyono after it was unveiled to the public at the 2012 Indo Defence Expo and Forum in Jakarta, Indonesia so that the Komodo can have a strong impression \"at any combat field and could bring the glory for Indonesia.\", especially since the Komodo dragon is an endemic animal native to Indonesia.

The 2004 season was a disappointment for Surrey under the captaincy of Jonathan Batty, who was replaced by Mark Butcher for 2005. However, Butcher was out for most of the season due to an injury to his left wrist, leaving Mark Ramprakash as interim captain - one of the few, maybe the only, man to captain both Surrey and their arch-rivals Middlesex. Surrey are 10-3 second favourites for the County Championship - and started their season with a damp draw against neighbours Sussex. In the totesport League, they lost their first game in a highscoring match at the Oval against Yorkshire, which showed up how long the Surrey tail is.After these games, they then took on the students of Bradford/Leeds UCCE and to their surprise, and the students' credit, Surrey lost by 4 wickets. More concerning though were the injuries picked up by Martin Bicknell, Ian Salisbury and Rikki Clarke, which meant none of these three bowled in the final innings. It got no better for Surrey the following Sunday, when they lost heavily to Durham. Surrey then went to Cardiff to play Glamorgan. The game was won by a combination of Jimmy Ormond, who made a career-best 7 for 63, and Mark Ramprakash who scored a century on the way to notching up his 25,000th first class run. They didn't play then until the May Day Bank Holiday, when they were humbled away to Somerset. On 4 May they were run hard by Staffordshire in the C&G Trophy, who at times threatened to repeat Ireland's humbling of Surrey in 2004, but ultimately the Lions prevailed. They then lost heavily to Nottinghamshire, who went to the top of the Division One table as a result, before beating Divisional whipping boys, Glamorgan convincingly at the Oval. They were then whipped themselves in the Second Division of the National League, as Leicestershire County Cricket Club beat them by 60 runs. On 17 May they beat defending champions Gloucestershire in the Second Round of the C&G Trophy, and three days later won their first totesport League match of the year against Scotland. They then hung on for a draw in the Championship against Kent. It was during this match that it was announced that Surrey were to lose 8 points because of ball-tampering in the match against Nottinghamshire. This left them fifth in Division One at the end of May. The first game in June was a 4-day draw with Warwickshire at Whitgift School, before losing by 49 runs to the same team on the same ground the next day. They then went on to Lord's where they took 12 points in a high-scoring draw against Middlesex, before thumping one of the favourites, Hampshire, by an innings and 55 runs. Surrey started their Twenty20 campaign with two victories, over Kent and Middlesex, and despite a loss against Hampshire they looked on course for more Twenty20 success. Indeed, they won their next three games, and despite two losses on the end of the campaign to Essex in a 5-over game and Sussex, they finished top of the South Division. In the County Championship, they squandered a 325-run first innings lead against Gloucestershire, failing to bowl them out in 157 overs of the second innings and having to settle with a draw, before getting only their second win of the National League season - a three-run squeeze against Yorkshire. However, they were knocked out of the C&G Trophy by Hampshire shortly afterwards, before enduring a big loss to Derbyshire in the National League. In the quarter-final of the Twenty20 Cup, shortened by rain, their game with Warwickshire was tied on the Duckworth–Lewis method so the captains agreed to have a bowl-off, which Surrey won 4-3, thus progressing to the semi-final. Their Championship cricket was less impressive, as they lost sight of the leaders after a four-wicket defeat to Kent, where they conceded 232 in 35 overs to lose the match, and their one-day form was as woeful as usual, as they conceded 219 runs in 22 overs to Sussex in a shortened Sunday League game at Guildford, which they lost by 48 runs. A draw - their sixth of the Championship season - with Nottinghamshire followed, to leave them fourth in the table, twenty points adrift of the leaders Nottinghamshire. The Twenty20 Cup semi-finals and final was hosted at Surrey's home ground The Oval, but the home fans were disappointed in the team as Surrey went out in the semi-finals to Lancashire Lightning. August began with a five-wicket Championship loss to Sussex, before winning two successive National League games, against Kent and Leicestershire. A virtual second XI, nevertheless including Mark Butcher and Saqlain Mushtaq, drew with Bangladesh A. The fourth day of their Championship match with Gloucestershire was rained off, meaning that Surrey had to endure their seventh draw of the season, and were still in the relegation zone. Even in one-day cricket, rain haunted them, as the National League clash with Kent was rained off, and they suffered their eighth Championship draw of the season against Hampshire, as relegation became an all the more imminent threat. Two matches in the National League followed before the end of August, which both ended in losses, to Somerset and Sussex. September, however, began well for Surrey, as they recorded an eight-wicket League victory over Derbyshire. Their winning ways didn't last long, however, as they drew with Warwickshire in the Championship before losing in the National League, and on the second day of their \"relegation play-off\" with Middlesex Surrey were confined to relegation in the Championship, as they had conceded too many bonus points. Despite going on to win by an innings and 39 runs, and also recording a victory Scottish Saltires in the National League, the season ended on a glum note for Surrey.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Charles H.

Her sister ships were Haruna, Kirishima and Hiei. During the late 1920s, all but Hiei were reconstructed and reclassified as battleships. After the signing of the London Naval Treaty in 1930, Hiei was reconfigured as a training ship to avoid being scrapped. Following Japan's withdrawal from the London Naval Treaty, all four underwent a massive second reconstruction in the late 1930s. Following the completion of these modifications, which increased top speeds to over, all four were reclassified as fast battleships. The Kongō-class battleships were the most active capital ships of the Japanese Navy during World War II, participating in most major engagements of the war. Hiei and Kirishima acted as escorts during the attack on Pearl Harbor, while Kongō and Haruna supported the invasion of Singapore. All four participated in the battles of Midway and Guadalcanal. Hiei and Kirishima were both lost during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in November 1942, while Haruna and Kongō jointly bombarded Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. The two remaining Kongō-class battleships spent most of 1943 shuttling between Japanese naval bases before participating in the major naval campaigns of 1944. Haruna and Kongō engaged American surface vessels during the Battle of Leyte Gulf.

Penney. Through an acquisition of the General Merchandise Company in 1962, J.C. Penney entered the discount department store market by launching The Treasury. The General Merchandise Company, which began as Treasure Island, was founded by David Kritzik and his two sons, Robert and Stanley, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The original stores were named Treasure Island, but because of trademark and copyright conflicts, some of the stores that were subsequently opened were called The Treasury. The only exceptions in this case were around Milwaukee and Appleton, Wisconsin and Atlanta, Georgia, which retained the Treasure Island name. In 1962, J.C. Penney was looking to break into the catalog business, and used their acquisition of the Treasure Island brand name to do so.Eventually the Treasury had locations in most Southern U.S. states, California and the Milwaukee area. Some stores also sold food and fuel, like the Wal-Mart Supercenters of today. But the recessions of the 1970s and early 1980s were too much to bear for J.C. Penney, and the discount division started losing money. The Treasury stores were eventually closed in about 1981. However, the mail order business, which was the main reason for J.C. Penney's acquisition of Treasure Island, remains a thriving, multibillion-dollar endeavor. The roof architecture of The Treasury and Treasure Island stores was unique, having a zig-zag pattern that was very prominent both inside and outside. This is reflected in the store logo. The original advertising slogan referred to the stores as \"Under the squiggly roof.\" In 1979, The Home Depot chain subsequently launched its first four stores in these former Treasure Island storefronts (which it shared with Zayre) around the Atlanta area, as the home improvement chain was beginning around the same time that many Treasure Island stores were already closing. The latter slogan used by Treasure Island was \"It's a most unusual store\".

Sweeny graduated with a degree in graphic design from Rochester Institute of Technology. She later honed her illustrating skills under the direction of the iconic Alan E. Cober at University at Buffalo, The State University of New York. Soon after, Sweeny became a staff designer and illustrator for The Detroit News, working alongside other notable illustrators like Don Asmussen. During this time, Sweeny developed as a caricaturist, and received national recognition; an original illustration of musician Paul Simon is now part of a Library of Congress collection. While at the News, Sweeny began to attract a long roster of clients, including Rolling Stone, GQ and Entertainment Weekly. In 1995, Sweeny left the paper and moved to New York City to focus on her publishing clients in the area. Her client roster also includes Time Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, Business Week, The Village Voice, The New York Times, TV Guide, Comedy Central, The Atlantic, Fortune, The Los Angeles Times, and The Boston Globe. She also illustrated the cover for the book, \"The Hammer Comes Down,\" a biography of Tom DeLay. Wax-based colored pencil is Sweeny's medium of choice and she uses a unique burnishing technique for her illustrations to create color depth. Increasingly her works contain a mixture of pencil illustration and computer-based illustration. Sweeny's more recent work is notably less commercial and more introspective, esoteric and sublime. She has two recurrent themes that now dominate their work: windows into her subjects' torso that can reveal various types of hardware, and complex doodles, called \"Brain Clouds,\" that reveal patchworks of seemingly random thoughts and images hovering above human busts. Sweeny has appeared in the Society of Illustrators, RSVP, American Illustration, and Communication Arts juried annuals and has won illustration awards from the Society of Newspaper Design and the Society of Professional Journalists. In 2008, she appeared in a group gallery show at the Rockland Center for the Arts called \"Seven: Out of This World.\" In 2011, Sweeny was among several artists chosen to reinterpret the art of Edward Hopper for a gallery show at the Edward Hopper House Art Center in celebration of the museum's 40th anniversary.

Hinde's life in the Maldives began in December 1973. Hinde and fellow Australian surfer Mark Scanlon were shipwrecked on the North Malé atoll in the Maldives aboard the Whitewings, a ketch in which they had been hired as crewmembers. The Whitewings had been en route across the Indian Ocean from Sri Lanka to Réunion Island when they ran aground. Hinde spent several unplanned months in the Maldives repairing the boat. However, he quickly discovered how good the surfing potential was in the northern Maldives and decided to stay in the country. In order to stay in the country Hinde became a Maldivian citizen and converted to Islam, adding Hussein to his name. He married a Maldivian woman, Zulfa, on 27 May 1983. Hinde largely managed to keep the surfing possibilities of the Maldives an open secret among surfing friends for almost fifteen years. However, in the mid-1980s Hinde opened Atoll Adventures, a surfing camp in Tari village, in response to plans by foreign investor to open resorts in the area. Hinde continued to run the surfing camp and hotel, which changes its name to Dhonveli Beach & Spa in early 2000. It is now known as Chaaya Dhonveli, or Dhonveli Beach. Tony Hussein Hinde died on 27 May 2008 while surfing at Pasta Point in Malé Atoll in the Maldives at the age of 55. He suffered an apparent heart attack after riding a wave.

While the majority of miRNAs are located within the cell, some miRNAs, commonly known as circulating miRNAs or extracellular miRNAs, have also been found in extracellular environment, including various biological fluids and cell culture media. Encoded by eukaryotic nuclear DNA in plants and animals and by viral DNA in certain viruses whose genome is based on DNA, miRNAs function via base-pairing with complementary sequences within mRNA molecules. As a result, these mRNA molecules are silenced, by one or more of the following processes: miRNAs are well conserved in both plants and animals, and are thought to be a vital and evolutionarily ancient component of gene regulation. While core components of the microRNA pathway are conserved between plants and animals, miRNA repertoires in the two kingdoms appear to have emerged independently with different primary modes of action. Plant miRNAs usually have near-perfect pairing with their mRNA targets, which induces gene repression through cleavage of the target transcripts. In contrast, animal miRNAs are able to recognize their target mRNAs by using as little as 6–8 nucleotides (the seed region) at the 5' end of the miRNA, which is not enough pairing to induce cleavage of the target mRNAs. Combinatorial regulation is a feature of miRNA regulation in animals. A given miRNA may have hundreds of different mRNA targets, and a given target might be regulated by multiple miRNAs. The first miRNA was discovered in the early 1990s. However, miRNAs were not recognized as a distinct class of biological regulators until the early 2000s. miRNA research revealed different sets of miRNAs expressed in different cell types and tissues and multiple roles for miRNAs in plant and animal development and in many other biological processes. Aberrant miRNA expression are implicated in disease states. MiRNA-based therapies are under investigation. Estimates of the average number of unique messenger RNAs that are targets for repression by a typical miRNA vary, depending on the estimation method, but multiple approaches show that mammalian miRNAs can have many unique targets. For example, an analysis of the miRNAs highly conserved in vertebrates shows that each has, on average, roughly 400 conserved targets. Likewise, experiments show that a single miRNA species can reduce the stability of hundreds of unique messenger RNAs. Other experiments show that a single miRNA species may repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression often is relatively mild (much less than 2-fold). The first human disease associated with deregulation of miRNAs was chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Other B cell malignancies followed.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"James Trevor Oliver, (born 27 May 1975) is a British celebrity chef and restaurateur.

T.\") Moore (June 24, 1882 – October 30, 1958) was an American businessman, ornithologist, philanthropist, the founder and editor-in-chief of the Borestone Mountain Poetry Awards. In his obituary, Lionel Stevenson wrote, \"Robert Thomas Moore was an exceptional amalgam of the poet, the scientist, and the man of affairs.\"<ref name=Borestone59> Moore was the son of Henry D. Moore, a wealthy Philadelphia businessman. Moore earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1904 and an M. A. from Harvard University in 1905 in English literature. Moore's father was from Maine, and owned a family vacation camp at Big Benson. Moore purchased land on Borestone Mountain in Maine and began the Borestone Mountain Fox Company. The Company ran several fur farms that raised foxes for their pelts, which were used for fur garments. In 1921 the Borestone Mountain farm was referred to as \"the leading ranch in North America\". In the 1920s Moore opened the Borestone Mountain Ranch, which was a fur farm near Big Bear Lake in southern California. In addition to his business activities, Moore was an active ornithologist who published about 60 scientific papers. From 1911–1916 Moore edited Cassinia, which is the journal of the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club. Moore moved to California around 1929, and became an associate of the Department of Zoology at the California Institute of Technology. In 1933 he hired Chester C. Lamb to help build his collection of birds; Lamb worked with Moore on the project for 22 years, collecting ~40,000 bird and mammal specimens in Mexico from 1933 until 1955. Herbert Friedmann has written that Moore's \"great achievement was his forming of the Moore collection, containing about 65,000 birds, over 80 percent of which are from Mexico, and 1,000 mammals, now housed in a building given by him to Occidental College in Los Angeles, with an endowment for its maintenance and for furthering studies on American birds, particularly those of Mexico and adjacent areas.\" The Moore Laboratory of Zoology at Occidental College is still in operation half a century following Moore's death; the present director is Dr. John E. McCormack. Friedmann also particularly notes Moore's discovery of two new bird species and a genus; Moore is credited at the Integrated Taxonomic Information System with the discoveries of five bird species (the tufted jay, the masked mountain-tanager, the maroon-fronted parrot, the short-crested coquette, and the Balsas screech-owl) and thirty subspecies. Moore was first to climb the Ecuadorean stratovolcano Sangay in 1929. From 1934–1938, Moore chaired the Galápagos Commission of Ecuador, which has worked to conserve the natural history of the Galápagos Islands. In 1940, he was elected a Fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union. In 1946, Moore established the Borestone Mountain Poetry Awards. In 1949, he published an anthology of poems selected from those published in 1948 by English-language magazines around the world; the authors of several of these poems were awarded cash prizes by a panel of noted poets working as volunteer judges. The prizes and publication of the anthology were continued annually through 1977, well past Moore's death in 1958.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 24, 2010. In the episode, Kyle, Stan, Kenny, and Cartman write a vulgar book with the sole intention of getting it banned. When Stan's parents discover the manuscript, the boys accuse Butters of writing it, then are enraged when it becomes hailed as a literary masterpiece. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It serves as a satire of pop culture criticism, and mocks people who find hidden messages in works which are ironically unnecessary. The episode includes other themes, including the lack of interest in reading among American youths, and mocks the idea that a book alone can inspire someone into committing violent crimes. The novel The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger plays a major part in the episode, as the South Park boys are inspired to write their own book when they feel Salinger's book does not live up to its controversial reputation. The episode also mocks actress Sarah Jessica Parker and the Kardashian family from the reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians. \"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\" received generally positive reviews, with many commentators praising the episode's themes of the over-analysis of works of culture.

Typically a song is played, and the performer expressively performs a sign language version of the lyrics. Well-known sign singers include the Japanese Tomoko Nakayama, a follower of Nichiren Buddhism, and the bawdy Australian duo Dislabelled. In London in 2003, a series of \"Deaf Idol\" events were held where deaf participants competed in karaoke singing, dance etc., in a similar format to the TV show Pop Idol. Sign language can be used to express extremely nuanced feeling, and so sign singing is an important creative input for the deaf. Sign singing is featured in the movie Napoleon Dynamite during a scene when two members of the \"happy hands club\" perform a song titled \"The Rose\" written by Bette Midler, entirely in sign. The signing club depicted in the film was largely inspired by a sign singing club that was previously established at Preston High School (Idaho), where the movie was filmed. The film brought wider attention to the club, originally called the \"Good hands club,\" which was founded by educator Dan Robertson, who conceived the idea for the group while studying ASL at Brigham Young University.

Within the TNZ the basal rate of heat production is in equilibrium with the rate of heat loss to the external environment. The endotherm does not have to use large amounts of energy to control its temperature within the thermal neutral zone, the organism adjusts to the temperatures within the zone through different responses requiring little energy. It can show postural changes where it changes its body shape or moves and exposes different areas to the sun/shade, and through radiation, convection and conduction, heat exchange occurs. Vasomotor responses allow control of the flow of blood between the periphery and the core to control heat loss from the surface of the body. Lastly, the organism can show insulation adjustments; a common example being “goosebumps” in humans where hair follicles are raised by pilomotor muscles, also shown in animals’ pelage and plumage. This allows heat to be trapped between hairs. Below the thermal neutral zone there is the zone of LCT (lower critical temperature) and above there is the zone of UCT (upper critical temperature). The organism reaches the LCT when the Ta (ambient temp.) decreases. When an organism reaches this stage the metabolic rate increases significantly and thermogenesis increases the Tb (body temp.) If the Ta continues to decrease far below the LCT hypothermia occurs. When the Ta reaches too far out of the UCT the rate heat gain and heat production become higher than the rate of heat dissipation (heat loss through evaporative cooling), resulting in hyperthermia.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Anthony Calvano (born January 8, 1982 in Garden Grove, California) is an American soccer player.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"George Henry Jarvis (3 December 1889 – 1969) was a Scottish footballer who played in the Football League for Stoke.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Boris Ivanovich Shavyrin () (1902, Yaroslavl – 1965) was a Russian artillery and rocket engineer who developed the first air-augmented rocket, Gnom, or Gnome (installable on mobile complexes or large tanks), as well as many other Soviet mortars and rockets.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The 1969 European Figure Skating Championships were held at the Olympia-Eisstadion in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, West Germany.

Predicting adverse events accurately represents a significant challenge to both the pharmaceutical industry and academia, the reason being that our existing knowledge of biology, disease mechanisms (i.e. how a disease affects the healthy state of a human) and drug design is incomplete and sometimes incorrect. On top of that, the biological complexity and differences between living organisms is such that even if a treatment appears to work in the laboratory it may not work in humans. The occurrence of an adverse event during a clinical trial is a significant event, not only because of the risk to humans but also from a financial point of view for the organization (usually a pharmaceutical company) sponsoring the development of the drug in question. As a result a lot of effort is continuously invested in this area and there are a number of approaches to predicting adverse events including cell line assays, animal models and computer based in silico models. In silico models are usually developed by extracting interactions and behaviors of biological systems either from the literature or from experimental data on a specific disease or biological system and integrating this information in some kind of a mathematical model that can be used to understand and predict the behavior of a drug in an organism. Another relatively recent method is based on mining the scientific literature and correlating evidence from seemingly unrelated drugs or medical conditions. If done correctly this type of analysis can offer quite good predictive accuracy and significant lead times which translates to lower cost and development times for new drugs. While in silico methods aim to capture in depth the current knowledge of a biological system or a disease mechanism, they are still subject to the accuracy of that knowledge and may miss information that while seemingly unrelated, could in a multiply interconnected complex biological system prove highly relevant. This gap is addressed by the literature-based discovery approach which does not capture details to the same extent but compensates by offering complete coverage of the available knowledge from all potentially related fields.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Trystan Layne is an American pop rock band that formed in Austin, Texas in 2004 consisting of Edison Bradley (lead vocals/rhythm guitar/keyboard), Adam Franklyn Rogoyski (lead guitar/backing vocals), Joshua Applebee (bass guitar), and Tyson Sheth (drums).

He studied the philosophy of Hägerström and Phalèn, and describes also their opinions about Einstein’s theories in his book, together with reviews of many other contributors. His book, Relativity, Time and Reality, is a controversial critique of Albert Einstein's concepts of time and simultaneity in Special Relativity. His arguments have been generally considered invalid. The primary objection in the first part of his critique is that Einstein's concept of simultaneity, while seemingly not depending on Newtonian time, nevertheless presupposes it: 1=Both in the Special and the General Theory the characterization of the movement of our system of reference K&prime; in relation to another presupposes a time concept valid for the whole of space. Since Einstein rejects classical a priori universal and uniform time, his first task is to create a new time concept, and this he undertakes to do with the aid of the light-ray regulation of clocks. This however, presupposes time relation between distant points in order to identify them and through his reasonings Einstein unconsciously presupposes time in the classical sense. &hellip; The result is that Einstein’s Theory of Relativity is based on the indiscriminate use of the word ‘time’ in two different meanings which makes his Theory untenable from a logical point of view.

Before 1792, authority over convicts during transportation was wielded by the ship captain. For various reasons this arrangement resulted in neglect of the convicts' health and well-being, and there were many deaths. Often the deaths during a single voyage would number in the hundreds. In 1792, the decision was made to appoint the ship's surgeon to a position of authority in all matters not directly related to the sailing of the ship. This was an immediate success, reducing the death rate to no more than around ten per voyage. Officially styled \"superintendent\", the responsibilities of the surgeon-superintendent were largely equivalent to that of a Naval Agent. However they also continued to fulfill the role of a naval surgeon, and so were commonly referred to by the title \"surgeon-superintendent\".","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Carl Adolph von Basedow (28 March 1799 – 11 April 1854) was a German physician most famous for reporting the symptoms of what could later be dubbed Graves-Basedow disease, now technically known as exophthalmic goiter.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"'Cheech & Chong's Greatest Hit' is a comedy album by Cheech & Chong.

It usually begins with a Thursday fast. On Friday, known as the question day, lay catechists, called \"the men\", would give their interpretations of Bible verses chosen by the minister. They would occasionally emerge as charismatic leaders of local revivals. A day of preparation would be held on Saturday. The climax was the Sabbath day celebration of communion, often outdoors in a natural amphitheatre. A thanksgiving service would be held on Monday. The practice developed in the eighteenth century as a result of hostility toward episcopacy, poverty, and lack of ministers. Where ministers refused or neglected parish communion, large assemblies were carried out in the open air, often combining several parishes. These large gatherings were discouraged by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, but continued. They could become mixed with secular activities and were commemorated as such by Robert Burns in the poem \"Holy Fair\". In the Highlands communicants travelled great distances and lodged with friends and family. In the United States, Presbyterians incorporated communion seasons into evangelical revivalism, and there the practice contributed to the development of the camp meeting.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Ceratophyllus picatilis is a species of flea in the family Ceratophyllidae.
