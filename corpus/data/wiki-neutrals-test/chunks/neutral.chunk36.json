His name is sometimes Esperantized as Kolomano Kaloĉajo, and some of his work was published under various pseudonyms, including C.E.R. Bumy, Kopar, Alex Kay, K. Stelov, Malice Pik and Peter Peneter. Kalocsay studied medicine and later became a surgeon and the chief infectious disease specialist at a major Budapest hospital. He learned both Esperanto and its breakaway dialect Ido in his adolescence but became more inclined towards Esperanto after he had seen its greater literary potential. In 1921 his first original collection of poems, Mondo kaj Koro (“World and heart”) was published. A further decade passed before the appearance of his collection Streĉita Kordo (“A taut string”), which many Esperantists consider as one of the finest collections of original Esperanto poetry, and Rimportretoj (“Portraits in rhyme”), witty poems in rondel style about various people then prominent in the Esperanto movement. In 1932, under the pseudonym Peter Peneter, he published Sekretaj Sonetoj (“Secret sonnets”), a book of erotic verse. Kalocsay guided the Esperanto literary world through the magazine and publishing house called Literaturo Mondo (“Literary world”). A group of writers who coalesced around this magazine during the 1920s and 1930s was known as the Budapeŝto skolo (“Budapest school”). Works of Kalocsay about literary and linguistic theory include the expansive Plena Gramatiko de Esperanto (“Complete grammar of Esperanto”) and Parnasa Gvidlibro (“Handbook of Parnassus”), a work on Esperanto poetics co-authored with Gaston Waringhien, and an academic style guide for Esperanto, Lingvo – Stilo – Formo (“Language, style and form”). Kalocsay also co-compiled the two-volume Enciklopedio de Esperanto (“Encyclopædia of Esperanto”). Much was written about Kalocsay by his literary executor Ada Csiszár, after whose death the estate passed to the Esperanto museum of the Austrian National Library.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Proteus ( ; Greek: Πρωτεύς), also known as Neptune VIII, is the second largest Neptunian moon, and Neptune's largest inner satellite.

Between January 1996 and April 1996 the clearance of approximately 360 acre of land including 120 acre of woodland, and the felling of nearly 10,000 mature trees to make way for the construction of the road, led to some of the largest anti-road protests in European history. Around 7,000 people demonstrated on the site of the bypass route in some way and over 800 arrests were made. The cost of policing the protest (known as 'Operation Prospect' and run jointly by Thames Valley Police and Hampshire Constabulary) had reached approximately £5 million by December 1996. An additional £30 million was spent on private security guards, security fencing, and security lighting while the works were in progress, of which only £7 million was budgeted for in the original contract.

It was part of the Dacian Kingdom (1st–2nd centuries CE), Roman Dacia (2nd–3rd centuries), the Hunnic Empire (4th–5th centuries), the Kingdom of the Gepids (5th–6th centuries), the Avar Khaganate (6th–9th centuries) and the 9th century First Bulgarian Empire. During the late 9th century, western Transylvania was reached by the Hungarian conquerors and later it became part of the Kingdom of Hungary, formed in 1000. After the Battle of Mohács in 1526 it belonged to the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom, from which the Principality of Transylvania emerged. During most of the 16th and 17th centuries, the principality was a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire; however, the principality had dual suzerainty (Ottoman and Habsburg). In 1690, the Habsburgs gained possession of Transylvania through the Hungarian crown. After 1711 \" In 1711, after the Peace Treaty of Szatmar, Austrian control was firmly established over all of Hungary and Erdely, and the princes of Transylvania were replaced by Austrian governors. \" (Google Search) Habsburg control of Transylvania was consolidated, and Transylvanian princes were replaced with Habsburg imperial governors. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the separate status of Transylvania ceased; it was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary (Transleithania) as part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. After World War I, Transylvania became part of Romania. In 1940 Northern Transylvania reverted to Hungary as a result of the Second Vienna Award, but it was reclaimed by Romania after the end of World War II.Due to its varied history the population of Transylvania is ethnically, linguistically, culturally and religiously diverse. From 1437 to 1848 political power in Transylvania was shared among the mostly Hungarian nobility, German burghers and the seats of the Székelys (a Hungarian ethnic group). The population consisted of Romanians, Hungarians (particularly Székelys) and Germans. The majority of the present population is Romanian, but large minorities (mainly Hungarian and Roma) preserve their traditions. However, as recently as the communist era ethnic-minority relations remained an issue of international contention. This has abated (but not disappeared) since the Revolution of 1989 restored democracy in Romania. Transylvania retains a significant Hungarian-speaking minority, slightly less than half of which identify themselves as Székely. Ethnic Germans in Transylvania (known as Saxons) comprise about one percent of the population; however, Austrian and German influences remain in the architecture and urban landscape of much of Transylvania. The region's history may be traced through the religions of its inhabitants. Most Romanians in Transylvania belong to the Eastern Orthodox Church faith, but from the 18th to the 20th centuries the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church also had substantial influence. Hungarians primarily belong to the Roman Catholic or Reformed Churches; a smaller number are Unitarians. Of the ethnic Germans in Transylvania, the Saxons have primarily been Lutheran since the Reformation; however, the Danube Swabians are Catholic. The Baptist Union of Romania is the second-largest such body in Europe; Seventh-day Adventists are established, and other evangelical churches have been a growing presence since 1989. No Muslim communities remain from the era of the Ottoman invasions. As elsewhere, anti-Semitic 20th century politics saw Transylvania's once sizable Jewish population greatly reduced by the Holocaust and emigration.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Love of Chair was a recurring sketch on the television program The Electric Company.

The name is taken from the custom of putting an extra candle on a birthday cake as \"one to grow on\". One to Grow On focused on ethical and personal safety dilemmas and attempts to teach viewers how to solve them. The PSA appeared immediately after the end credits of an NBC cartoon, such as ABC did with Schoolhouse Rock! and CBS with In the News. The segments were hosted by the stars of NBC primetime series, including Michael J. Fox, Michael Gross, and Justine Bateman from Family Ties; Mr. T and Dwight Schultz from The A-Team; Soleil Moon Frye from Punky Brewster; David Hasselhoff from Knight Rider; Kim Fields, Nancy McKeon, Lisa Whelchel, and Charlotte Rae from The Facts of Life; Richard Moll from Night Court; Malcolm-Jamal Warner and Tempestt Bledsoe from The Cosby Show; Perry King and Thom Bray from Riptide; Joel Higgins and Rick Schroder from Silver Spoons; Kadeem Hardison from A Different World; Jackée Harry from 227; Estelle Getty and Betty White from The Golden Girls; and Michael Landon from Highway to Heaven. Although many of the celebrities featured were from sitcoms or shows that kids were familiar with, René Enríquez from the adult oriented prime time show Hill Street Blues also hosted a segment; specifically on how children should not be watching his TV show since it was broadcast too late, past a typical child's bedtime on a school night. Another special move was when pro athlete Ozzie Smith hosted a segment which revolved around the issue of usage of snuff, where Smith explained in his segment that he is not a user of snuff and it has nothing to do at all with baseball playing ability or the \"image of the big leagues\". A few segments featured a young Jaleel White as one of the child actors. The PSAs begin with an animated sequence that leads into an animated TV on which an actor appears. After the actor introduces himself or herself (which, until 1986, was followed by a 30-second commercial), a live-action sequence appears, in which a child faces an ethical dilemma. One to Grow On cuts back to the actor, who explains to the viewer how to solve the problem. The child then either has to own up to the consequences of the action or make an effort to recitfy the situation. The actor ends the segment by saying, \"And that's One to Grow On.\" One to Grow On was replaced by The More You Know in September 1989.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"'''Thomas J.

His most famous work is his Portrait of a Man in a Black Cap. His son John Bettes the Younger, with whom he is sometimes confused, was a pupil of Nicholas Hilliard who painted portraits during the reign of Elizabeth I and James I. Nothing is known of John Bettes's life, except that he was living in Westminster in 1556, according to a documented court case. He is first recorded as working for Henry VIII at Whitehall Palace in 1531. Queen Catherine Parr's accounts for 1546/47 record payments to Bettes for \"lymning\" (painting in miniature) the king's and queen's portraits, and for six other portraits. Her new year's gift of 1547 to Prince Edward was a pair of portraits of the king and herself. Bettes has been identified as the designer of the engraved title-border for William Cuningham's Cosmographical Glasse, printed by John Day in 1559. He may also be the designer of engravings for Edward Hall's Chronicle, published in 1550, and of a woodcut portrait of Franz Burchard, the Saxon ambassador to England, published in 1560. In 1576, John Foxe referred to Bettes as already dead. An earlier second edition of Foxe's Actes and Monuments printed in 1570 refers to Bettes' death. The identification of John Bettes's work stems from the inscription on the back of Man in a Black Cap: \"faict par Johan Bettes Anglois\" (\"done by John Bettes, Englishman\"). The painting is dated 1545 on the front. On the basis of its style, four further portraits have been attributed to Bettes: two of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Baron Wentworth, (1549); (154/3?); and  (c. 1545).","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Dane van Niekerk (born 14 May 1993) is a South African cricketer born in Pretoria and educated at Centurion High School.

The FTS is associated with the Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation, which is active in fundraising abroad. FTS operates Ekal Vidyalayas in Assam, Orissa, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, while its sister organization Bharat Lok Shiksha Parishad (BLSP) operates in Uttar Pradesh, Uttranchal, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. The schools (Ekal Vidyalyas) are led by a local person who is trained as a teacher. The curriculum is mainly basic literacy in the language of the state, but also introduces concepts of Hinduism, even in areas where that is not the main religion. An Ekal Vidyalaya teacher was killed by Naxalites for ignoring their directive not to teach Hindu culture. As of July 2003, the FTS was operating 6,966 schools with 222,775 students.

Consequently, he was the most important official in Upper Egypt after the king himself. He has generally been equated with Heqakheperre Shoshenq II by the English Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen and viewed as a short-lived co-regent to his father based on the Nile God British Museum statue 8 which identifies him as the son of Osorkon I and Queen Maatkare, daughter of Hor-Psusennes but this assumption is unproven. In the statue, Shoshenq C is called \"the Master of the Two Lands\" and the formula \"beloved of Amun\" is enclosed within a royal cartouche. However, in the text of the statue, he is not given a specific throne name or prenomen, the use of a cartouche by a royal prince is attested in other periods of Egyptian history such as that of Amenmes, son of Thutmose I, and the documents depicts Shoshenq C as a simple High Priest of Amun on the side of the legs of the Nile God, rather than a king. In addition, none of Shoshenq C's three wives used the title \"King's Wife\" in any of their artifacts. More significantly, none of his 3 children ever gave their father a royal title on their own funerary objects such as a Priest Osorkon whose funerary papyri is now in the St Petersburg Museum, or the God's Wife Karomama Meritmut. Finally, as Helen Jacquet-Gordon perceptively notes in her Bi Or 32(1975) Book Review of Kenneth Kitchen's TIPE book, Shoshenq C's third child—the Priest (and future king) Harsiese A does not assign royal titles to his father on a Bes-statue in Durham Museum which he dedicated to his father's memory. Instead, Shoshenq C is only \"designated the 1st Prophet of Amun without other [royal] titles.\" Hence, Jacquet Gordon's observation: if Shoshenq C had even \"the slightest pretensions to royal rank, his son [Harsiese] would not have omitted to mention...[this] fact. We must therefore conclude that he (ie: Shoshenq C) had no such pretensions.\" All this evidence taken together suggest that the High Priest Shoshenq C was not a king in his own right and is not Shoshenq II, whose Royal tomb was found intact in Tanis. As an aside, king Shoshenq II did not include any mementos or objects which mention Osorkon I within his own tomb. This is an improbable situation if he was indeed a son of this king who predeceased—and thus was buried by—his father, Osorkon I. The only other king mentioned by artifacts in Shoshenq II's tomb was Shoshenq I. Other Dynasty 22 kings such as Takelot I, employed funerary goods naming their parents, in their own tombs. The High Priest Shoshenq C was probably succeeded in office by Iuwelot, who was also another son of Osorkon I. Shoshenq C's son, Harsiese, later ruled over Thebes and Middle Egypt as king Harsiese A. There is a high degree of academic uncertainty regarding the parentage of Shoshenq II: some scholars today argue that this mid-50's year old ruler was actually a younger son of Shoshenq I due to the discovery of items naming the founder of the 22nd Dynasty in his royal Tanite tomb such as \"a pectoral of the great chief of the Ma Shoshenq A, and a bracelet of Shoshenq I.\" Karl Jansen-Winkeln concludes thus: \"The commonly assumed identification of this king with the (earlier) HP and son of Osorkon I does not appear to be very probable.\" Other scholars including Jürgen von Beckerath and Norbert Dautzenberg view the High Priest Shoshenq C as an entirely separate ruler who ruled over Thebes and Upper Egypt as king Maatkheperre Shoshenq; this Libyan Pharaoh had statue Cairo CG 42192 rededicated and reinscribed. They consequently distinguish him entirely from king Heqakheperre Shoshenq II at Tanis.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Bontoc (Bontok) (also called Finallig) is the native language of the indigenous Bontoc people of the Mountain Province, in the northern part of the Philippines.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Richard Warren Schickel (February 10, 1933 &ndash; February 18, 2017) was an American film historian, journalist, author, documentarian, and film and literary critic.

The hamlet was founded in the late 1980s by Gilani and a group of primarily African American Muslims who left New York City, reportedly to escape crime, poverty and racism. They built a community of some 40 family houses, with its own grocery store and bookstore and place of worship, on some land 11 mi north of the town of Hancock. Islamberg is the first of a number of communities set up under the direction and tutelage of Gilani. \"Holy Islamberg\", as residents refer to it, is also the headquarters of the Muslims of America organization.

Very little else about her is known. Among her compositions was the first opera by a woman to be performed at the Vienna court theater. She may have lived at the noble court for periods between 1713 and 1718; however, she was not employed at the court as a musician. She may also have been one of a number of women composers at the Viennese court who were canonesses, a type of Augustinian nun; others included Caterina Benedicta Grazianini, Maria de Raschenau, and Camilla de Rossi. Grimani's known works include an opera, specifically a componimento dramatico or opus dramaticum, which may or may not have been staged, Pallade e Marte, dedicated in Bologna on April 5, 1713 and first performed at the imperial theater on the nameday of Emperor Charles VI on November 4, 1713 at the imperial theater. It was scored for two voices, oboe and string orchestra. Her oratorios were also performed at the imperial theater: La visitazione di Elisabetta, performed in 1713 and again in 1718, and La decollazione di S Giovanni Battista, performed in 1715. The librettists are unknown. Both celebrate Charles's military success against the \"infidels\". Grimani may have been related to the powerful Grimani family, perhaps to Pietro Grimani, who negotiated an alliance between Charles VI and Venice (of which Pietro was later doge) against the Turks, in the same year that Maria's Pallade was performed at court. In addition, George Frideric Handel's patron and librettist for Agrippina, Vincenzo Grimani, was viceroy of Naples at the time. Nevertheless, Maria's exact relationship to the Grimani family is unclear. All of Grimani's works use small forces—two singers, a couple of obbligato instruments, and a continuo group, including cello and theorbo. Their form follows the standards of the time, as exemplified in Alessandro Scarlatti's works. This included a number of da capo arias with ritornelli and recitative secco.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"KWYY (95.5 FM) is a radio station in Casper, Wyoming, branded as \"95.5 My Country\" and carrying a country music format.

It is classified as a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs. In the spring of 1906, Monsignor Vladimir Ghika, working with Sister Elisabeta Pucci, whom he had called from Thessaloniki, began work on a building for the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul on land donated by Maria Pâcleanu. In 1922, work began on the Saint Vincent de Paul Sanatorium, inside of which there was a chapel where masses were held until 1930. Additionally, there was a chapel in Pâcleanu's adjacent residence. In 1930, next to the sanatorium's eastern wall, the Daughters of Charity built the parish church, with the altar facing north. On November 12, 1946, the C. I. Parhon Endocrinology Institute was established in the building of the sanatorium. Thus, the area retained a charitable focus, but the church was closed in 1957, a decade into the Communist regime; all charitable activity \"by superiors for the poor, orphans and the sick\" had been outlawed. On rare occasions, services were held for foreign delegations passing through the country. On December 1, 1991, following the collapse of Communism, the church was reopened and the parish re-established. In 2004, fifty years after he died a political prisoner in Jilava prison, a statue depicting Ghika was placed on a square near the church. As of 2009, the parish has nearly 2000 members, and services are regularly held in Romanian, French, English, Latin and Arabic. The church is in the style of a basilica, with three naves preceded by a small vestibule. The central nave is 6 m wide and has a slightly vaulted ceiling. The others are lower, have flat ceilings, are 3 m wide and are each separated by four square-shaped pillars with Byzantine-style capitals. An extension of the central nave, marked by an arch, features the apse, which has stained-glass windows and a horizontal ceiling.

Fourteen bas-relief panels on the walls depict the Stations of the Cross. The exterior is painted simply, in white. The roof has two slopes and is covered in terracotta tiles. Above the roof, behind the entrance facade, there is a small tower with square sides. This has four small, open three-lobed arches, and sharp-angled pediments on each side.

As a result of their well received debut, the band began to make a name for themselves with their contemporary take on 90's era west coast melodic punk. The lead single, Anything & Everything, garnered heavy rotation on college and university radio stations across the United States. In 2007, Costello released a second full-length LP entitled In Vino Veritas. The album was generally well received by critics and listeners, and helped further establish the band's signature sound. As one reviewer at thepunksite.com noted, \"They are catchy without dumbingit down, energetic without being obnoxious, and just a hell of a lot of fun to listen to. I guess that if in wine we findthe truth, in Costello, we find pop-punk greatness.\" Costello was chosen, along with a handful of other Los Angeles punk bands, to represent the L.A. punk/rock scene with the contribution of the track 'Live It Up\" to the 2008 Crimescene Records compilation CD ''LA's Most Wanted''.

Under the doctrine, as long as the facilities provided to each race were equal, state and local governments could require that services, facilities, public accommodations, housing, medical care, education, employment, and transportation be segregated by race, which was already the case throughout the former Confederacy. The phrase was derived from a Louisiana law of 1890, although the law actually used the phrase \"equal but separate\". The doctrine was confirmed in the Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court decision of 1896, which allowed state-sponsored segregation. Though segregation laws existed before that case, the decision emboldened segregation states during the Jim Crow era, which had commenced in 1876 and supplanted the Black Codes, which restricted the civil rights and civil liberties of African-Americans during the Reconstruction Era. 18 states had segregation laws. In practice the separate facilities provided to African Americans were rarely equal; usually they were not even close to equal, or they did not exist at all. For example, according to the 1934-36 report of the Florida Superintendent of Public Instruction, the value of “white school property” in the state was $70,543,000, while the value of African-American school property was $4,900,000. The report says that “in a few south Florida counties and in most north Florida counties many Negro schools are housed in churches, shacks, and lodges, and have no toilets, water supply, desks, blackboards, etc. Counties use these schools as a means to get State funds and yet these counties invest little or nothing in them.” High school education for African-Americans was provided in only 28 of Florida’s 67 counties. The doctrine of separate but equal was overturned by a series of Supreme Court decisions, starting with Brown v. Board of Education of 1954. However, the overturning of segregation laws in the United States was a long process that lasted through much of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, involving federal legislation (especially the Civil Rights Act of 1964), and many court cases.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"A digestive biscuit, sometimes described as a sweet-meal biscuit, is a semi-sweet biscuit (sometimes referred as a \"cookie\") that originated in Scotland, and is popular worldwide.

On its publication, in reviewing the book, Martin Caidin wrote that his reminiscences \"stand excitingly as individual chapter-stories, but the author has woven them superbly into a lifetime of flight.\" Roger Bilstein, in a history of flight, says that of books that discuss airline operations from the pilot's point of view, \"few works of this genre equal E. K. Gann's 'Fate Is the Hunter,' which strikingly evokes the atmosphere of air transport flying during the 1930s.\" The plot of the 1964 film Fate Is the Hunter had no relation to the book. Gann had written some early drafts of the script, but was so unhappy with the final result that he asked to have his name removed from it. In his autobiography, A Hostage to Fortune, Gann wrote, \"They obliged and as a result I deprived myself of the TV residuals, a medium in which the film played interminably.\" The plot of the fictional book, The High and the Mighty, (written by Gann) bears some resemblance to one of the true stories in Fate Is the Hunter. On a flight from Hawaii to Burbank, California, the stewardess complained of a vibration that was rattling the dishes and silverware at the rear of the plane. Gann inspected the tail compartment and noticed nothing amiss. The vibration was later traced to a missing elevator hinge bolt, which could have led to aerodynamic unporting and a loss of control. However, Gann was eager to begin his vacation the next day and flew at a higher than expected airspeed, holding the elevator in place. Another fictional book by Gann, Island in the Sky, is also based on a true story told in Fate Is the Hunter. The book was also made into a movie of the same name.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Deidra Dionne (born February 5, 1982) is a Canadian freestyle skier.

The Additional Act reframed the Napoleonic constitution into something more along the lines of the Bourbon Restoration Charter of 1814 of Louis XVIII, while otherwise ignoring the Bourbon charter's existence. It was very liberal in spirit, and gave the French people rights which had previously been unknown to them, such as the right to elect the mayor in communes of less than 5,000 in population. Napoleon treated it as a mere continuation of the previous constitutions, and it therefore took the form of an ordinary legislative act \"additional to the constitutions of the Empire\".","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Leonard Beeghley (born December 14, 1946) is Professor Emeritus of sociology at the University of Florida since 1975.

For fixed set of genetic and environmental conditions, recombination in a particular region of a linkage structure (chromosome) tends to be constant and the same is then true for the crossover value which is used in the production of genetic map. Crossover implies the exchange of chromosomal segments between non-sister chromatids, in meiosis during the production of gametes. The effect is to assort the alleles on parental chromosomes, so that the gametes carry recombinations of genes different from either parent. This has the overall effect of increasing the variety of phenotypes present in a population. The process of non-sister chromatide exchanges, including the crossover value, can be observed directly in stained cells, and indirectly by the presence or absence of genetic markers on the chromosomes. The visible crossovers are called chiasmata. The large-scale effect of crossover is to spread genetic variations within a population, as well as genetic basis for the selection of the most adaptable phenotypes The crossover value depends on the mutual distance of the genetic loci observed. The crossover value is equal to the recombination value or fraction when the distance between the markers in question is short.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Agalmaceros is an extinct genus of deer of the Cervidae family, that lived in South America during the Pleistocene.

On June 20, 1775, these Patriots, who had formed themselves into a group known simply as \"The Association\", met at Lewis Barge's tavern in Cross Creek (now part of Fayetteville) to sign a document protesting the actions of Great Britain following the battles of Lexington and Concord. The signers expressed the hope that Great Britain and the colonies would be reconciled, but vowed that, if necessary, they would \"go forth and be ready to sacrifice our lives and fortunes to secure her freedom and safety\". The resolves were thus not a declaration of independence—public advocation for separation from Great Britain would not become common until 1776. The period of the American Revolution was a time of divided loyalties in Cumberland County, and a considerable portion of the population, especially the Highland Scots who had immigrated in 1739, were staunchly loyal to the British Crown. Among them was the famous Scottish heroine Flora MacDonald.

Depending on the design of the vehicle, motorized trikes may be categorized as motorcycles, motor scooters, or simply the three-wheeled counterpart to a motorized or electric bicycle. The main difference between a motorcycle trike and a scooter trike is that motorcycles are sat on in a \"saddle\"-style seating (as with a horse), with the legs apart, and motorcycles have manual transmissions. Scooters have a \"step-through\" seating style, in which the driver sits on a more chair-like seat, with the legs together; as well, scooters have automatic transmissions. Laypersons often associate the engine size as a dividing line between motorcycles and scooters, since a typical scooter has a small 50 cc engine, but scooter engines can also be as large as 650cc as used in the Suzuki Burgman. Motorcycles with sidecars are not usually considered tricycles. It can be harder to categorize three-wheeled automobiles. While some early prototype automobiles were steam tricycles, three-wheeled cars such as the Morgan 3-Wheeler are often classified as cars rather than motorcycles.

USA FAIR was founded by family members of registrants; its members today include former offenders and allies from legal, social justice, and treatment communities. On several occasions, through press releases and letters to editors, USA FAIR has requested corrections to inaccurate stories on sex offender issues. USA FAIR has publicly expressed its concern that highly publicized, violent sex crimes provoke knee-jerk responses in the form of even harsher sex offender laws, while in fact most registrants have little in common with the dangerous predatory offenders. The Executive director of USA FAIR, Shana Rowan was interviewed by WHTVs CNY Central in 2013 in a story covering her personal history and the cause of USA FAIR.

Escher for his print Belvedere. It is a two-dimensional figure that superficially resembles a perspective drawing of a three-dimensional cube, with its features drawn inconsistently from the way they would appear in an actual cube. In Belvedere a boy seated at the foot of a building holds an impossible cube. A drawing of the related Necker cube (with its crossings circled) lies at his feet, while the building itself shares some of the same impossible features as the cube. The impossible cube draws upon the ambiguity present in a Necker cube illustration, in which a cube is drawn with its edges as line segments, and can be interpreted as being in either of two different three-dimensional orientations. An impossible cube is usually rendered as a Necker cube in which the line segments representing the edges have been replaced by what are apparently solid beams. In Escher's print, the top four joints of the cube, and the upper of the two crossings between its beams, match one of the two interpretations of the Necker cube, while the bottom four joints and the bottom crossing match the other interpretation. Other variations of the impossible cube combine these features in different ways; for instance, the one shown in the illustration draws all eight joints according to one interpretation of the Necker cube and both crossings according to the other interpretation. The apparent solidity of the beams gives the impossible cube greater visual ambiguity than the Necker cube, which is less likely to be perceived as an impossible object. The illusion plays on the human eye's interpretation of two-dimensional pictures as three-dimensional objects. It is possible for three-dimensional objects to have the visual appearance of the impossible cube when seen from certain angles, either by making carefully placed cuts in the supposedly solid beams or by using forced perspective, but human experience with right-angled objects makes the impossible appearance seem more likely than the reality. Other artists than Escher, including Jos De Mey, have also made artworks featuring the impossible cube. A doctored photograph purporting to be of an impossible cube was published in the June 1966 issue of Scientific American, where it was called a \"Freemish crate\".

Most of the river is in Sonoma County, but a portion is in Mendocino County. The headwaters of the river (measuring via its South Fork) are high in the Coast Range, and it empties into the Pacific Ocean. For its last few miles, it forms the boundary between Sonoma County and Mendocino County. John Sutter's militia captain Ernest Rufus is credited with naming the river. There is disagreement about whether the name is originated from the Pomo word Walali meaning where the waters meet or English for What Water read The Law. (Que Agua Le La Ley) The river has three forks: the South Fork, Wheatfield Fork and the North Fork. The South Fork is the longest and travels northwest, parallel to the coast along the San Andreas Fault rift zone. The Wheatfield Fork begins west of Lake Sonoma and has the largest flow of the three forks. Its tributaries include Tombs, Wolf, House, Haupt and Fuller creeks. Wheatfield is the first fork to combine with the South Fork. Buckeye Creek, a tributary of the river, joins the South Fork next. It is followed by Rockpile Creek and Big Pepperwod Creek. The North Fork is the only part of the river in Mendocino County. It travels roughly southwest towards the coast along the San Andreas Fault rift zone and meets the South Fork at the border between the counties, a few miles before the river flows into the ocean. The mountainous watershed has an area of about 298 sqmi, three quarters of it in Sonoma County and one quarter in Mendocino County. Rainfall varies from 38 in per year at the coast to 70 in inland. The watershed is sparsely populated. Timber production is the predominant land use, historically and currently. Grazing was previously important but has become less prevalent. The river provides recreation, municipal and industrial water supply for the community of Gualala, California, and wildlife habitat including cold freshwater habitat for fish migration and spawning. The most important problem for the watershed is excessive erosion. The area has a high degree of natural erosion because of uplift and displacement caused by the San Andreas Fault, which runs through the area. However, logging and roads have greatly increased the amount of sedimentation in the river. Kelly Road, which runs between Lake Sonoma and Annapolis, is a major source of sediment in the river and its tributaries. High water temperatures is another significant problem. Logging has removed large streamside trees that provided shade and reduced the amount of large woody debris, which creates pools. In 2002, Alaska businessmen and former Reagan administration Interior Department official Ric Davidge announced plans to collect water from the Albion and Gualala rivers in large bags and tow it several hundred miles south to San Diego as drinking water. However, the plan drew local opposition,  and was eventually shelved after the state government passed new laws requiring extensive studies of the effects on fish habitats before any such plan could proceed.

The Dangar Island Ferry connects Brooklyn to Dangar Island and Little Wobby Beach, both of which are communities that have no road access, and which rely entirely on river transport. The ferry operates seven days a week and provides an irregular, but roughly hourly, service to Dangar Island, with some services continuing to Little Wobby Beach. Australia's last Riverboat Postman operates under contract to Australia Post and delivers the mail to isolated homes and communities along the Hawkesbury River between Brooklyn and Spencer.

The book, written in English, was published in 1644 with the subtitle \"The Law and the Prince\". Published in response to Bishop John Maxwell's \"Sacro-Sancta Regum Majestas\", it was intended to be a comprehensive defence of the Scottish Presbyterian ideal in politics. The book defends the rule of law and the lawfulness of defensive wars (including pre-emptive wars) and advocates limited government and constitutionalism in politics and the \"Two Kingdoms\" theory of Church-State relations (which advocated distinct realms of church and state but opposed religious toleration). Rutherford's Lex, Rex utilizes arguments from Scripture, Natural Law and Scottish law, and along with the sixteenth century Vindiciae contra tyrannos, it attacked royal absolutism and emphasized the importance of the covenant and the rule of law (by which Rutherford included Divine Law and Natural Law as well as positive law). After the Restoration, the authorities cited Rutherford for high treason, but his death intervened before the charge could be tried. Lex, Rex itself was burned in Edinburgh (the Scottish capital) and St. Andrews (where Rutherford had been principal of the university) and in 1683 Oxford University included it in what ended up being the last official book-burning in England. The attack on absolutism, the defence of the rule of law and the emphasis on the importance of the covenant made Lex, Rex a precursor to the social contract idea, and helped pave the way for the political theory of John Locke. However, Rutherford's views on Church-State relations and his opposition to religious toleration were not shared by Locke.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Victor G.

Subsequently, for six years he was research assistant while he worked in parallel towards doctorates in theology and as well as religious history. In 1961, he received his habilitation in religious history and comparative religion.

Rudolph stresses that religious studies must be rational science and therefore has a duty to subject itself to a methodological atheism. This thesis, which initially was fiercely contested in German religious studies, is now largely a matter of consensus. Since his retirement in 1994, Kurt Rudolph received honorary doctorates in Århus and Leipzig.

It was originally a vision of French immigrant, David G. Lorenzi. In 1911 Lorenzi came to the Las Vegas Valley lured by the rumors of artesian wells that would transform the desert to farm land. He purchased 80 acre of property on the outskirts of town, about two miles west current downtown Fremont Street area in 1912. When Lorenzi drilled one of the most abundant wells of its time, it fostered dreams David brought with him from France, to create a vineyard in the desert to make European-styled wines. However in 1912 Las Vegas was more of a beer and whiskey town so the vineyard idea quickly died. The abundance of water there allowed Lorenzi to create the signature lakes we see rebuilt today. The property first opened as Lorenzi’s Lake Park in 1926 with a pool, dance pavilion, two lakes with an island in each and orchards. Lorenzi charged very little to enter into the Resort. He made his money from the amenities he provided. It became the local destination with rowboats, ice cream, fireworks, prize fights, horse races, dance contests, beauty pageants, a band shell with weekly bands. The shell even doubled as an outdoor movie screen. The resort was busy during the prohibition era. It became a place where local socialites could go to ignore prohibition. Lorenzi wanted to sell the property for use as a city park. He offered it to the city for $70,000 in 1936. Unfortunately the city stated it was too far out of their budget. The property sold in 1940 to become Twin Lakes Lodge, a resort getaway with a 48-room hotel. In the 1950s with the emergence of the Nevada Test Site, Twin Lakes hosted scientists and their families that worked there. Twin Lakes was prominent in another local \"industry\", dude ranching and divorce in Nevada. In most jurisdictions divorces were hard to get. You could not just state, \"irrevocable differences\" and seek a divorce. The resort played an important role as Divorce seekers were able to stay at the motel the six weeks required to establish residency. The motel also presented a real \"Western\" experience offering horseback riding, rodeo events, fishing, and authentic food. This brought in visitors from all over the world! By 1965 the resort was finally purchased for $750,000 by the city to become a city park. The remaining motel buildings and the two lakes give us an important glimpse of Las Vegas's past. In 2013 the City of Las Vegas re-opened Lorenzi Park after a $30 million upgrade. The lake has been completely redone and reverted to its Twin Lake configuration. The band shell on the island has returned. New amenities have been created while keeping the flavor of the old resort.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Edoardo Goldaniga (born 2 November 1993) is an Italian footballer who plays a defender for Serie A club Sassuolo.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The 1991 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team represented the Oklahoma State University during the 1991 NCAA Division I-A football season.

It can also refer to Ignatius I Daoud.'' Ignatius (, ) (1540–1620) was a Russian Orthodox bishop of Greek descent who was the second Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia in 1605–1606, even though his status is now disputed and he is frequently omitted from the list of Patriarchs of Moscow by the Russian Orthodox Church. Ignatius was reported to be of Cretan descent. He came to Russia in 1595 as a member of an ecclesiastic mission, sent by the Patriarch of Constantinople. He took part in the coronation of Boris Godunov. In the early 17th century, Ignatius was appointed Archbishop of Ryazan. After the death of Godunov, he expressed support to False Dmitriy I and, even before the pretender reached Moscow, was swearing in his supporters in Tula. On 30 June 1605, Ignatius was elected patriarch by the council of bishops to replace Patriarch Job, who was sent into exile for refusing to acknowledge the pretender's rights for Russian throne. Ignatius performed the coronation of False Dmitriy I on 21 July 1605 and later also celebrated the coronation of his wife Marina Mnishek and their marriage. At that time, Ignatius was also an ardent opponent of the Unia. After the assassination of False Dmitriy I, Ignatius was removed from his see and confined in the Chudov Monastery by the order of Tsar Vasili IV. In 1610, patriarch Ignatius supported False Dmitriy II. n April this year the patriarch Hermogen, consistently calling on the Russians to participate to arms and the expulsion of the Poles from the country was thrown into prison in the Monastery Czudowskim. His duties were taken over, this time without the confirmation of this fact by the council, by Ignatius. But the latter did not want to remain in the civil war-stricken Russia and December 27, 1611 made an attempt to escape from Moscow. In the vicinity of Smolensk, Ignatius was assaulted, robbed, and then stopped in the Polish camp outside the city. Polish King Sigismund III Vasa hoped that in the future will be able to renew war with Russia, and intended to use the former patriarch person Ignatius was taken to Vilnius and settled in the Holy Trinity Church of the Basilian Monastery. At that time he also converted from Russian Orthodoxy to Byzantine Rite Catholicism (\"the Unia\"), thus entering into the full communion with the Pope. The date of the death of Ignatius traditionally were positioned around 1640, but in more recent studies mentioned much earlier years 1618 or 1619. The clergyman was buried in the church of the Holy Trinity in the Basilian monastery in Vilnius. His remains were probably removed from the tomb and exported out of the city by the Russian army after the capture of Vilnius in 1655. Due to his active role in the installation of False Dmitriy I to the Moscow throne and later conversion to the Unia, Ignatius has suffered from damnatio memoriae in subsequent ages and often is not counted among the legitimate patriarchs by the Russian Orthodox Church. Even though his predecessor Patriarch Job was removed from his post by force, the legitimacy of Ignatius' election and his status as patriarch was not questioned by his contemporaries.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT) is a union representing about 100,000 painters, glaziers, wall coverers, flooring installers, convention and trade show decorators, glassworkers, sign and display workers, asbestos worker/hazmat technician and drywall finishers in the United States and Canada.

The epithet came to be taken as the proper name of two separate deities in Norse mythology, Freyr and Freyja. In both Old Norse and Old High German the female epithet became a female honorific \"lady\", in German Frau further weakened to the standard address \"Mrs.\" and further to the normal word for \"woman\", replacing earlier wîp (English wife) and qinô (English queen) \"woman\". Just like Norse Freyja is usually interpreted as a hypostasis of *Frijjō (Frigg), Norse Freyr is associated with Ingwaz (Yngvi) based on the Ynglingasaga which names Yngvi-Freyr as the ancestor of the kings of Sweden, which as Common Germanic *Ingwia-fraujaz would have designated the \"lord of the Ingvaeones. Both Freyr and Freyja are represented zoomorphically by the pig: Freyr has Gullinbursti (\"golden bristles\") while Freyjahas  Hildisvíni has (\"battle-pig\"), and one of Freyja's many names is Syr, i.e. \"sow\".The term's etymology is ultimately from a PIE *pro-w-(y)o-s, containing *pro- \"in front\" (c.f. first, Fürst and Sanskrit purohita \"high priest\", lit. \"placed foremost or in front\"). Variants indicate n-stems *fraujan-, *frōwōn-. The feminine *frawjōn \"lady, domina\" in Old English is attested only in a single isolated occurrence as frēo \"woman\" in the translation of the fragmentary Old Saxon Genesis poem, in the alliterating phrase frēo fægroste \"fairest of women\". The stem was confused from early times with *frīj-, which has variants frēo-, frīo-, frēa- (a contraction of *īj- and a following back vowel) beside a less frequent  frīg- (/fri:j-/), by development of a glide between ī and a following front vowel. The two forms would originally have figured in complementary distribution within the same paradigm (e.g. masculine nominative singular frēo, masculine genitive singular frīges), but in attested Old English analogical forms are already present and the distribution is no longer complementary For Old Norse, Snorri says that freyja is a tignarnafn (name of honour) derived from the goddess, that grand ladies, rîkiskonur, are freyjur. The goddess should be in Swed. Fröa, Dan. Frøe; the Swed. folk-song of Thor's hammer calls Freyja Froijenborg (the Dan. Fridlefsborg), a Danish one has already the foreign Fru. Saxo is silent about this goddess and her father altogether; he would no doubt have named her Fröa. The Second Merseburg Charm may have Frûa = Frôwa as the proper name of the goddess, although the word in question is difficult to read. In Germanic Christianity, the epithet became a name of God, translating,  (Gothic frauja, Old English frēa, Old High German frô). Old Norse Freyr would correspond to a Gothic *fráus or *fravis, instead of which Ulfila has fráuja (gen. fráujins) to translate, pointing to a proto-form *frawjaz in North Germanic, but a *frauwaz in West Germanic and Gothic. In Old High German, the full form *frouwo was already lost, the writers preferring truhtîn and hêrro \"lord\". In the Old Low German, it survives in the vocative, as frô mîn! \"my lord!\" The Heliand has frô mîn the gôdo, waldand frô mîn, drohtîn frô mîn, besides frôho (gen. frôhon) and frâho (gen. frâhon). Old English freá (gen. freán, for freâan, freâwan) is more common in poetry, as in  freá ælmihtig (Cædmon 1.9; 10.1), and it also forms compounds: âgendfreá, aldorfreá, folcfreá and even combines with dryhten (freádryhten, Cædm. 54.29, gen. ''freahdrihtnes', Beowulf 1585, dat. freodryhtne 5150). By the side of OHG frô, there is found the indeclinable adjective frôno, which, placed before or after substantives, imparts the notion of lordly, high and holy, as in der frône bote \"the angel of the Lord\", conspicuously avoiding the genitive singular (*frôin bote). It survives in Modern German as Fron- in compounds such as Frondienst \"socage\", whence also a verb frönen. Grimm attaches significance to the avoidance and the grammatical peculiarities of the lexeme in OHG: :\"the reference to a higher being is unmistakable, and in the Middle ages there still seems to hang about the compounds with vrôn something weird, unearthly, a sense of old sacredness; this may account for the rare occurrence and the early disappearance of the OHG. frô, and even for the grammatical immobility of frôno; it is as though an echo of heathenism could still be detected in them.\" The word occurs in given names, such as Gothic Fráuja or Fráujila, OHG Frewilo, AS Wûscfreá Old English freáwine in Beowulf is an epithet of divine or god-loved heroes and kings, but Freáwine (Saxo's Frowinus) is also attested as a personal name, reflected also as OHG Frôwin, while the Edda has  uses Freys vinr of Sigurðr and Saxo says of the Swedish heroes in the Bråvalla fight that they were Frö dei necessarii.
