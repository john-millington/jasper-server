This was intended to improve value for money to the taxpayer, optimising the level of taxpayers equity directed towards the delivery of services. Similar organisations can be found in most western European countries, for instance Hansel Ltd. in Finland and Consip in Italy. The OGC supported initiatives to encourage better supplier relations, sustainable procurement, the benefits of utilising smaller suppliers and the potential of eProcurement. Representing the UK at the European Union (EU), the organisation assisted the public sector application of EU procurement rules within the United Kingdom.

Though it keeps a unity in its diversity-art, architecture, art forms and culture communicate the standard of living, knowledge, development, technology and imagination of a community. Those factors play a major role in these forms of communication. Culture influences the thinking process of people also. Culture of a person is inherited from his ancestors through gene transitions and he will be showing signs of his traditional heritage and ancestral habits. That is why there is a similarity with the profiles of parents and children in major cases regarding their education and career. It is similar in case of countries also. The countries like USA which is well advanced in technology and research gets more and more advanced in the next generation also because there is an unconscious cultural, technical, mental and intellectual communication communicated from one to another.The influence of mother tongue is very obvious in the English accent of the people in India and it is known as Indian accent in India, in other countries there are different kinds of accents like Korean, German, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, and Braziliam accents.

FitzPatrick subsequently resigned his position and was followed within twenty-four hours by the bank's non-executive director, Lar Bradshaw and chief executive, David Drumm. A new chairman of Anglo, Donal O'Connor, was quickly appointed from the board, a move welcomed by the Irish Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan. A number of investigations have been launched into the reasons behind the three resignations. The Central Bank of Ireland is carrying out a review of the bank's dealings, although its Financial Regulator, Patrick Neary, has also since resigned his position. So too did a number of other chairmen, directors and executives involved with Anglo, Irish Life and Permanent and Irish Nationwide. Within days of the initial admission, an announcement was made that Anglo Irish Bank would be one of three (alongside Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland) that would be recapitalised by the Irish government. The recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank was expected to be effected in mid-January 2009, following an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM). Lenihan instead unexpectedly announced the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank the night before the EGM due to difficulties he encountered with the recapitalisation process. Recapitalisations of the other two banks mentioned were expected by the end of March 2009 but, according to Taoiseach Brian Cowen, were expected to be finalised in early February 2009 at a total of €7 billion. The nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank on 21 January 2009 followed two more resignations earlier that month. On 7 January 2009, another director, Willie McAteer, resigned, becoming the fourth casualty of the controversy. Two days later the Financial Regulator Patrick Neary retired amidst much criticism over his handling of the affair.

Although the Treaty of Hartford established English recognition of the tribe's sovereignty in 1638, after the colonial period and loss of lands, the tribe struggled to maintain recognition of its identity. For centuries its people were assumed by whites to have assimilated to majority culture. The tribe reorganized in the late 20th century and filed a federal land claims suit, seeking to regain land that the state of Connecticut had illegally sold. As part of the settlement, the Mohegan Nation gained federal recognition by the United States government in 1994. That year the US Congress passed the Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claim Settlement Act. The US authorized the cleaned-up United Nuclear site for use as Mohegan reservation lands, and the property was transferred to the United States in trust for the tribe. Gaining a sovereign reservation enabled the Mohegan to establish gaming operations on their lands to generate revenue for welfare and economic development of their tribe.

It is usually eaten lukewarm with different jams, typically cloudberry, cherries or strawberry though lingonberry is often used, as well as fruits, whipped cream or, more rarely, ice cream. The reason for eating ostkaka while it is lukewarm is that if eaten too warm, the delicate flavors of the ostkaka will not come through, and if eaten too cold the consistency will be too firm and heavy.

McCaffrey et al.' (later, Conant v. Walters) is a legal case decided by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on September 7, 2000, which affirmed the right of physicians to recommend medical marijuana. Though the case involved chronic patients with untreatable diseases, the decision does not name these conditions as a prerequisite, nor does it limit drugs which may or may not be illegal. The plaintiffs created a class action suit on behalf of licensed California physicians treating patients suffering from any of several severe and chronic conditions who discuss, recommend, or approve the medical use of marijuana for medical reasons. The class also includes all such patients. The named plaintiffs include eleven physicians, a physician group, an AIDS patient organization, and six patients with terminal illnesses, including one who died during the course of the suit. The case arose from two events: the November 1996 passage of California Proposition 215 which authorized medical marijuana, and a December 30, 1996 response to the law by the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy which said The statement accompanied authorization for the U.S. Inspector General for Health and Human Services to exclude individuals from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs, such as physicians who recommend marijuana to patients for medical purposes. Clarification two months later affirmed that mere discussion of any drugs with a patient was not grounds for sanction, but affirmed that physicians \"may not intentionally provide their patients with oral or written statements in order to enable them to obtain controlled substances in violation of federal law.\" The district court's decision acknowledged that the government has a legitimate concern that physicians might recommend marijuana in bad faith. However, physicians in good faith using honest medical judgment should not fear DEA sanctions. Furthermore, The government appealed the District Court decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which issued its decision in 2002. Again the doctors and patients won and the federal government lost, while Judge Alex Kozinski's concurrence also brought in the First Amendment right of patients to hear accurate information from their doctors, and the state of California's right to make its own laws without being subverted by federal commandeering. The ruling set a precedent protecting doctors, patients, and state medical marijuana programs in the ten states of the Ninth Circuit. The government again appealed the case, but the Supreme Court declined to take the appeal in a brief notice dated October 14, 2003.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":" Kuruksoi is a village and jamoat in north-western Tajikistan.

Scattering experiments are sometimes also called complementary when they investigate the same physical property of a system from two complementary view points in the sense of Bohr.

It runs from MD 662 in Wye Mills on the border of Queen Anne's and Talbot counties, southeast to the Delaware state line in Caroline County, where the road continues as Delaware Route 404 (DE 404) to Five Points (near Rehoboth Beach). The Maryland and Delaware state highways together cross the width of the Delmarva Peninsula and serve to connect the cities west of the Chesapeake Bay by way of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and U.S. Route 50 (US 50) with the Delaware Beaches. Along the way, MD 404 passes through mostly farmland and woodland as well as the towns of Queen Anne, Hillsboro, and Denton. The route is a four-lane divided highway between US 50 and east of Denton, with the remainder of the route a two-lane undivided road. MD 404 was designated by 1933 to run from Matapeake (where the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry across the Chesapeake Bay connected the route to Annapolis), east along present-day MD 8, US 50, and MD 662 to Wye Mills, where it followed its current routing to the Delaware border. By 1946, the route’s western terminus was moved to MD 2 north of Annapolis, where it headed east across the Chesapeake Bay on the Sandy Point-Matapeake ferry. The western terminus was cut back to Wye Mills in 1949, having been replaced by US 50 west of there. The route was realigned to bypass Queen Anne and Hillsboro in 1960 and Denton in 1987.

On 21 June she was given the name Foudroyant to replace the previous ship bearing that name (destroyed at La Hogue). She was designed by Étienne Hubac and laid down the same month at Brest Dockyard, and launched on 24 December 1692. Two more three-deckers were ordered and begun at Brest during June (as Merveilleux) and August 1692 (as Terrible, and a further three-decker was ordered there on 20 January 1693, which Louis XIV ordered should bear the name Soleil Royal to replace the previous ship bearing that name (destroyed at Cherbourg). All three ships were to be designed and built by Blaise Pangalo. However, Étienne Hubac begged the King that that name should be given to the ship he was building instead, because the previous Soleil Royal had been built by his own father, Laurent Hubac, and - as he himself had rebuilt that ship from the keel up at Brest in 1689 - he still possessed the moulds for that ship. Moreover, he pointed out to the King that his own ship would be some 4 feet longer and some 200 tons larger than Pangalo's new ship, so would be more deserving of the name that honoured Louis XIV himself. On 1 March 1693, the King agreed to Hubac's proposal and the names of the two ships were exchanged. Hubac's ship was thus completed under the name Soleil Royal in April 1693 and brought into service. The new ship took part in the Battle of Lagos on 28 June 1693, and subsequently in the Battle of Vélez-Málaga on 24 August 1704, where she was the flagship of Lieut-Général Joseph Andrault, Marquis de Langeron.

It has been proven that the hexagonal grid serves as an optimal sampling lattice for isotropically band-limited two-dimensional signals and has a sampling efficiency which is 13.4% more when compared to the sampling efficiency obtained from rectangular sampling. Several other advantages of hexagonal sampling include consistent connectivity, higher symmetry, greater angular resolution, and equidistant neighboring pixels. Sometimes, more than one of these advantages compound together thereby increasing the efficiency by 50% in terms of computation and storage when compared to rectangular sampling. Despite of all these advantages of hexagonal sampling over the rectangular sampling, its application has been limited because of its inability to result in the orthogonal rows and columns that can be transformed independently as is done with rectangular samples. For this reason, an efficient FFT with a separable Fourier kernel has been developed by utilizing the Array Set Addressing (ASA) scheme and is termed as Hexagonal Fast Fourier Transform.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Francis Xavier Suarez (; born October 6, 1977) is an American attorney and politician serving as the 33rd and current Mayor of Miami.

In this draft, National Basketball Association (NBA) teams took turns selecting 57 amateur college basketball players and other first-time eligible players, such as players from non-North American leagues. The draft was broadcast on TNT at 7:30 PM (EDT). The NBA announced that about 42 college and high school players, and five international players, had filed as early-entry candidates for the draft. The Chicago Bulls and the Golden State Warriors both had a 22.5 percent probability of acquiring the first overall pick, but the Houston Rockets, with an 8.9 percent probability, won the NBA draft lottery on May 19. The Bulls and Warriors were second and third, respectively. As punishment for salary-cap violations during the 2000–01 season, the Minnesota Timberwolves forfeited their first-round draft pick. The 2002 draft set a record with 17 international selections, with six coming in the first round alone. Number 2 pick Jay Williams violated his contract by riding a motorcycle, and nearly lost his life in an accident that shattered his pelvis, severed a main nerve in his leg, and tore three ligaments in his left knee including his ACL. Although he underwent an intense rehabilitation program, Williams never played a game in the NBA again. When it became clear Williams would not be returning to the Bulls because of his injuries, he was waived. The Bulls could have voided Williams' contract, since riding a motorcycle was contractually prohibited. Instead the Bulls completed a $3 million buyout of the contract instead of having him walk away with nothing. The draft was notable for its relative weakness outside the top prospects, as well as the rampant injury concerns of those players. Top players had promising careers end prematurely due to injury, such as Yao Ming, Williams and Dajuan Wagner. Nevertheless, Yao was named a Hall of Famer—a selection predicated as much on his role in popularizing basketball in China as it was his actual on-court play.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The chelys (, ), was a stringed musical instrument, the common lyre of the ancient Greeks, which had a convex back of tortoiseshell or of wood shaped like the shell. The word chelys was used in allusion to the oldest lyre of the Greeks, which was said to have been invented by Hermes. According to the Homeric Hymn to Hermes, he came across a tortoise near the threshold of his mother's home and decided to hollow out the shell to make the soundbox of an instrument with seven strings. The word has been applied arbitrarily since classic times to various stringed instruments, some bowed and some plucked, probably owing to the back being much vaulted. Athanasius Kircher (Musurgia universalis, 486) applied the name of chelys to a kind of viol with eight strings. Numerous representations of the chelys lyre or testudo occur on Greek vases, in which the actual tortoiseshell is depicted. A good illustration is given in Le Antichità di Ercolano (vol. i. p1. 43). Propertius (iv. 6) calls the instrument the lyra testudinea. Joseph Justus Scaliger was probably the first writer to draw attention to the difference between the chelys and the kithara. The acoustics of an authentically reconstructed ancient Greek tortoise-shell lyre, known as chelys, was investigated recently. Modern experimental methods were employed, such as electronic speckle pattern laser interferometry and impulse response, to extract the vibrational behavior of the instrument and its main parts. Additionally, the emitted sound from the instrument was recorded, under controlled conditions, and spectrally analyzed. Major findings include the concentration of the emitted sound between 400 Hz and 800 Hz, with an amplitude modified in a manner consistent with the experimentally measured vibrational characteristics of the instrument’s sound box and bridge. The experimental results validate the historical evidence that chelys was used in Greek antiquity as an accompaniment instrument to the human voice.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"James Tullis Logie (23 November 1919 – 30 April 1984) was a Scottish footballer.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"In statistics the mean squared prediction error of a smoothing or curve fitting procedure is the expected value of the squared difference between the fitted values implied by the predictive function The MSPE can be decomposed into two terms (just like mean squared error is decomposed into bias and variance); however for MSPE one term is the sum of squared biases of the fitted values and another the sum of variances of the fitted values: The first term is equivalent to","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Mahidpur is a town and a municipality in Ujjain district in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.

He explained his motivation for joining the IRA in a 1998 interview with the Irish News, stating: \"I was almost shot in a gun attack at Norfolk Street. I came away wanting a gun. It was survival. You wanted to protect your own people ... my family and myself. When the barricades went up I wanted a gun so I approached this fella who was in the IRA and asked for gun and he said: could I shoot a British soldier? At that time I hadn't the idea that it was the British government's fault.\" In 1981, Fox, serving a twelve-year sentence in the Maze Prison for possession of explosives and bombing a hotel, joined the hunger strike on 24 August, replacing Paddy Quinn who was taken off the strike by his family. Fox ended his strike after 32 days without food on 24 September after doctors warned him he would be dead within days due to an obstructed kidney. As a result of his IRA activities, Fox was imprisoned on four occasions and spent over twenty years in prison, before being released in 1998 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement resulting from the Northern Ireland peace process. At Easter 2001, Fox was a speaker at the commemoration to mark the 85th anniversary of the Easter Rising in Dublin, saying \"after spending nearly 22 years in jail, one of the questions I'm most frequently asked is 'was it worth it'? I can't answer that question. History will answer that. The question is phrased in the past tense. It's not over. The struggle continues and will continue until the British are out of Ireland\". In 2005 Fox joined the IRA's Army Council replacing Brian Keenan who resigned due to ill-health. Fox resigned in September 2006 after accusing Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness of \"undemocratically\" controlling the organisation. In January 2007, Fox was returning from a family holiday when he was detained for questioning at Belfast International Airport by two men who identified themselves as members of the British security agency MI5, according to Fox's solicitors.

Referring to himself as a \"consulting detective\" in the stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation, forensic science, and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard. First appearing in print in 1887 (in A Study in Scarlet), the character's popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's friend and biographer Dr. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories begin. Though not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best known, with Guinness World Records listing him as the \"most portrayed movie character\" in history. Holmes's popularity and fame are such that many have believed him to be not a fictional character but a real individual;  numerous literary and fan societies have been founded that pretend to operate on this principle. Widely considered a British cultural icon, the character and stories have had a profound and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole, with the original tales as well as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle being adapted into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Philip I may refer to:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Amin Maalouf (; born 25 February 1949) is an award-winning Lebanese-born French author who has lived in France since 1976.

Sportswomen trained by him earned more than 50 titles at the National (USSR) championships, European championships, World championships and Olympic Games. Rastorotsky trained Soviet gymnasts for five Olympic cycles since the mid-1960s. His most famous pupils were Ludmilla Tourischeva, Natalia Shaposhnikova, and Natalia Yurchenko. Born in Liski, Russian SFSR, Rastorotsky liked sports since his childhood and had a propensity to gymnastics. He went to Voronezh and entered the Physical Education faculty. Rastorotsky began systematic training in gymnastics very late, in his twenties. But managed to earn the title Master of Sports of the USSR at age above 27. His teacher in Voronezh was another famous Soviet coach Yury Shtukman. In the 1960s Rastorotsky moved to Grozny and began to coach Ludmilla Tourischeva. According to Rastorotsky, Tourischeva initially had strong muscles but a weak gymnastics school, as compared to other his students; but he didn't meet more industrious and purposeful students neither before nor after her. In the early 1970s, Rastorotsky moved to Iraq, and namely since that time the period of Tourischeva's domination on international events began. Concerning his contribution to Tourischeva's successes, Rastorotsky said, that another famous gymnast, Olga Korbut, had many advantages over Tourischeva, and Korbut's dream to overcome her was always extraordinary. But their principled battles always ended with Tourischeva's win. Rastorotsky believes, that this was due to the better \"staging\". Rastorotsky's another favourite student was Natalia Yurchenko, one of the strongest gymnasts of the early 1980s. However, although she was the all around champion in many events of that period, she sometimes didn't get to the Soviet team roster due to the \"reserved\" places for other coaches and athletes. Rastorotsky liked Yurchenko for her \"boundless charm, filigree skill, resolution and courage\".

Its name Picu Urriellu is believed to be derived from the term Los Urrieles which is used to describe the Macizo Central. Naranjo de Bulnes is part of the Cabrales region of Asturias, and lies within the Picos de Europa National Park. The first written reference to \"Picu Urriellu\" as \"Naranjo de Bulnes\" is credited to the German geologist and engineer, Wilhelm Schulz, who, in 1855, published the first topographic and geological map of Asturias. As far as is known the etymology of this name is not clear, because, historically, the local inhabitants always referred to the mountain as \"Picu Urriellu\". It has been suggested that the name can be attributed to the orange hue of the limestone from which the peak is formed. The local residents of Bulnes have a saying concerning the contentious name: \"No me llameis Naranjo, pues fruto no puedo dar, llamadme Picu Urriellu que es mi nombre natural\". (Don't call me Orange tree, because fruit I cannot bear, call me Picu Urriellu which is my natural name). It has an altitude of 2,529 metres and although it is by no means the highest peak of the Cantabrian mountain range, it can be considered the best-known summit in the world of Spanish mountaineering, especially the 550m high vertical wall of the west face.

After his birth the family moved to nearby Medford. When Gould was ten years old his family, which then included three children, moved to Freeport, Maine. Gould was responsible for farm chores before and after school, but his father stressed the importance of his education. His family subscribed to ''The Youth's Companion, the Rural New Yorker and The Boston Post'', all of which published materials submitted by young Gould. In 1924, as a sophomore in high school, he offered to be a reporter for the Brunswick Record, and following an encouraging reply from the editor, began submitting news items and was thus gainfully employed with the Record until 1940. He was also writing as a stringer for other newspapers and as a result became a featured writer for the Boston Sunday Post. Having graduated from Bowdoin College in 1931, on his 24th birthday (October 22, 1932) he married Dorothy Florence Wells of Arlington, Massachusetts. After their honeymoon they made their home in Brunswick, Maine, where Gould resumed writing for the Brunswick Record and his wife became the newspaper's household editor.

Dating from circa 7,000–7,800 BCE, Baker Cave is a part of a system of rock shelters in the Lower Pecos Canyons region and was 120 feet long by 56 feet deep (37 m × 17 m). The ceiling varied from at the mouth to just a few inches in the back. These sites are common in the limestone formations in the Lower Pecos region. The site was perched well above the flood, preserving the materials that ancient peoples had left behind. A large cooking hearth was found inside it, dating to around 9,000 years ago, and containing small creatures such as snakes, rats, fish, and rabbits, and a wide variety of seeds and nuts, indicating a diversified diet. The recovery of a complete Golondrina point established Paleo-Indian residence in Baker Cave. They were estimated, by radiocarbon dating, to have been there sometime between 7080 BCE and 6960 BCE. These dates are older and not consistent with other sites in the area. Potential contamination of the charcoal tested could have led to this difference in dates. The people at Baker Cave had an archaic life and lived off small game and foraging. The mouth of the cave was primarily used for cooking, the middle of everyday life routine, and the rear of the cave for food processing. No further research has been done on Baker Cave; however, the Lower Pecos Region of Texas has numerous other cave excavations ongoing.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Persepolis Khorasan Shomali Football Club is an Iranian football club based in Bojnord, Iran.

It is located in the constellation of Centaurus, approximately 320 light years distant from the solar system. The system is a contact binary of the W UMa type - two stars in physical contact whose two components share a gaseous envelope. Its spectral type is A9V or F0V. The binary nature of the star was discovered in 1896 by the Scottish-South African astronomer Alexander Roberts, so the system has been well observed for over a century. The primary component has a mass of 1.82 solar masses, an effective temperature of around 6900 K, and a radius somewhat larger than twice the solar radius. The secondary component is 0.39 solar masses, giving a mass ratio of the system (q) of 0.210. the secondary has a temperature of about 6890 K and a radius is almost equal to the solar radius. The orbital period of this system is 0.6057 days (14.53 hours). Recent calculations by astronomers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences show a possible cyclic variation in orbital period over 65.1 ± 0.4 years whose amplitude is 0.0124 ± 0.0007 days. The origin of this periodic variation could be due to the gravitational influence of a third object yet observed. Superimposed on this variation seems to be a secular increase in the period of 1.21 x 10 –7 days per year, suggesting that there is transfer of stellar mass from secondary to primary component. If this increase is confirmed, RR Centauri may evolve into a single rapidly rotating star. RR Centauri is also an eclipsing binary, whose apparent brightness varies by around 0.41 magnitudes.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The '''men's 3000 metres''' event at the 1978 European Athletics Indoor Championships was held on 12 March in Milan.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Glenn L.

Planning for the structure began in earnest in 1964 when it was designated as part of the East Portland Freeway (later renamed Veteran's Memorial Freeway), Interstate 205. Construction began in August 1977. In order to avoid disrupting river traffic, the bridge was built one segment at a time. The segments, weighing upwards of 200 tons, were cast downstream and barged into place. The bridge was opened on December 15, 1982. The finished project cost was $169.6 million: $155.7 million from Federal funds, $4 million from Washington state funds and $9.9 million from Oregon state funds. Three men died during its construction. It is a twin structure with four lanes in each direction and a bicycle and pedestrian path in between.

Gibson started producing the S-1 in mid-1974, but released it on the market in 1975. Its production lifespan was 1974-1980. Like the Gibson Marauder, the S-1 was an attempt to break through into the single-coil guitar market. It too consisted of a flat Les Paul -like body with a maple Flying V neck bolted on. Unlike the Marauder, however, the S-1 featured three \"see-thru\" single-coil pickups designed by Bill Lawrence, with fairly elaborate circuitry to generate humbucking and single-coil pick-up sounds. Just like the Marauders, the S-1 all had Schaller made \"Harmonica\" (\"tune-o-matic\" style) bridges and the standard Gibson stopbar tailpiece. The S-1 had one 2 way toggle switch and a \"chicken head\" 4 position rotary switch. This 4 way rotary switch made it possible to use the pick-ups in 4 different ways: 1) neck + middle, 2), middle pick-up + bridge pick-up, 3) all three together, and 4) the neck and bridge out of phase. In the down position the 2 way toggle switch bypassed the entire 4 position rotary switch circuit and made one straight connection to the bridge pick-up, which resulted in a sound that was pretty close to that of the Fender Esquire (Telecaster in bridge only position). The potentiometers are volume and tone. The sound was similar to that of a Fender Stratocaster or a Fender Telecaster. The Gibson S-1 was initially endorsed by Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, as well as Carlos Santana. Like the Marauder, the nontraditional construction and Fender-like characteristics contributed to the unpopularity and demise of the model in the early 1980s. Both the Marauder and S-1 were phased out in early 1980, to be replaced by the brand new Gibson Sonex.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Restricted stock, also known as letter stock or restricted securities, is stock of a company that is not fully transferable (from the stock-issuing company to the person receiving the stock award) until certain conditions (restrictions) have been met.

It is named after Henry Stirling Trigg, Superintendent of Public Works in the Colony of Western Australia from 1838 to 1851. Trigg Island is in fact a small rocky aeolianite limestone remnant of Pleistocene dune s, better characterised as an outcrop than an island, and as such is typical of the Perth coast. It is sometimes physically joined to the beach by movements of both the sand and the tide. Trigg Island is notorious for its blue hole, located at the north end of the island. The first recorded incident of a death was in 1907. In September 1931, four men nearly died when their boat capsized near the Blue Hole. In May 1947, two brothers died in the Blue Hole, and later that year in July a nun named Sister Mary Chrysostom, and her would-be rescuer Frederick Charles Floyd, also drowned. A plaque commemorating the deaths of the latter two is stored in the Trigg Island Surf Life Saving Club facilities. These events were the main factor in the establishment of the Trigg Island Surf Life Saving Club. Many others have been rescued or died in or near the Blue Hole since. The beaches around Trigg Island are patrolled by the Trigg Island Surf Life Saving Club.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The FX5 was a Honeywell 6,000lb-thrust (27kN) geared turbofan based on a technology demonstrator core, aiming for a 20%-plus reduction in cost of ownership from the TFE731-60 and to span a family, it could have been certificated within 36 months.
