The pauper labor fallacy is usually used by employee organizations such as labor unions to promote protectionist trade policies restricting imports from abroad. Economic theory, however, states that it does not matter whether a foreign country's advantage in producing goods at low cost is due to high productivity or low wages. Instead, the domestic economy should specialize on the production of the goods for which it has a comparative advantage (and not necessarily an absolute advantage) and trade these efficiently produced goods against the goods for which foreign countries have comparative advantages. This approach is seen as consistent with the maximization of efficiency and theoretically allows countries to realize gains from trade.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"John Pollini is a professor of Art History and History at the University of Southern California.

It functions in accordance with the Law No. 5174 regarding the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey and the Chambers and Commodity Exchanges. İzmir has always been an important hub for agricultural production and one of the centres for domestic and foreign trade throughout the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Turkey. In fact, İzmir harbour was the most important export harbour of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century, which made the city the host for the first efforts to systemize the agricultural markets and the first commodity exchange of Turkey. In the second half of the 19th century, the boost in the volume of the trade in İzmir urged the merchants to seek for new methods and regulations in order to catch up with novelties. Although new warehouses had been built to store the goods, unbalanced price adjustments, lack of proper statistics to determine demand and supply, and uncertainty of the money markets used to negatively affect the commercial life of the city. These problems caused the tradesmen and producers to suffer great losses. The tradesmen of İzmir commenced to make several attempts to overcome these problems. The Commercial Assembly and İzmir Chamber of Commerce were established in 1850 and 1885, respectively. The English, French, Italians and the Dutch had their own chambers of commerce in İzmir. However, these attempts had fallen behind in creating solutions to the problems of the market. Although the first legal arrangements in the Ottoman Empire were carried out in 1886, it is known that some attempts were made before this date to establish a commodity exchange in İzmir. It is also known that the building belonging to a tradesman called Nişli Hacı Ali Efendi was used as “the grain exchange” just before the 1890s. The arguments to establish a modern commodity exchange based on a legal status and conforming to certain rules were brought forward in the early 1890s. In 1891, two different commodity exchanges were attempted to be established by two different tradesmen, however, the General Commodity Exchange regulations specified only one commodity exchange in each city. Therefore, upon the inspections by the Ministry of Public Works, Nişli Hacı Ali Efendi’s Commodity Exchange was declared as the sole legal exchange in the city and it was inaugurated with a ceremony on Monday, 13 June 1892. The first elections were held at the end of that year and the first board of directors was formed. The regulations came into effect on 21 January 1895. The products traded at the Exchange in 1897 were barley, wheat, refined flour, semolina, bran, rye, flour, corn, maize, chickpea, dry beans, black-eyed pea, hemp seed, vetch, aniseed, dent corn, sesame, broad bean, poppy seed, olive oil, cotton, cotton seed and opium poppy. The public was informed daily of the transactions and prices through the local newspapers, which made monitoring supply and demand volume of the market possible. As the economic life was severely damaged and agricultural production decreased during the World War I and Turkish Independence War, İzmir Commodity Exchange experienced rough times. Following the independence of Turkey and declaration of the republic, the present building of the İzmir Commodity Exchange was built and opened with a ceremony on 11 June 1928. Since then, İzmir Commodity Exchange has been serving its members and the society in general in the same building located at Gazi Boulevard No:2, Konak/İzmir.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Antonín Růsek (born 22 March 1999) is a Czech footballer who currently plays as a forward for FC Zbrojovka Brno.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Keep on Rockin' is the second greatest hits album by Australian singer-songwriter Brian Cadd.

He is usually thought to have been the son of Świętobór I (Swantibor), although other historians make him a brother of Świętobór (as well as of a third Pomeranian duke, Dumar) and son of Siemomysl I. He is mentioned in the chronicle of Gallus Anonymus. The 16th century Pomeranian chronicler Thomas Kantzow also states that Swietopelk was one of the younger sons of Swietibor, who ruled Eastern Pomerania after his father was deposed. The Prussian historian Ludwig Giesebrecht, who gave approximate dates for the duke's birth and death, considered him the originator of the Pomeralian dynasty and stated that Swietopelk and his father Swietibor were related to the Piast dynasty through marriage. Other historians have also hypothesized that Swietopelk and Swietibor were related, by blood or by marriage, to the Polish Piast dynasty, or that they served as voyevodas for them in Gdańsk (Danzig). However, Edward Rymar contests the thesis that Swietopelk was Swantibor's son based on the fact that Gallus Anonymous would have surely mentioned that fact, but rather the chronicler described Swietopelk as a \"certain Pomeranian\" who was granted control over Polish land by the Polish ruler. Along with his father he was most likely expelled from Pomerania around 1106 by rivals. After Bolesław III Krzywousty defeated Pomeranian dukes at the Battle of Nakło (whose forces, according to Gallus Anonymus numbered thirty thousand), he gave Swietopelk Nakło, and other grods (Slavic settlements) on the river Noteć as a fief. After Swietopelk tried to carry out foreign policy without approval of the Polish ruler in 1112, Krzywousty invaded his lands. After a three-month siege of Nakło (according to Gallus, from September 29 until December 25), he forced Swietopelk to submit. Swietopelk had to pay a tribute to the Polish duke and gave his son (name unknown) as a hostage. In 1113 Swietopelk once again rebelled against Polish rule and Bolesław once again invaded, taking Wyszogród and Nakło. Little is known of his later life. In 1119 Krzywousty defeated two unnamed Pomeranian dukes, taking one prisoner and banishing the other. It is possible that one of them was Swietopelk. According to later chronicles of Jan Długosz and Kantzow, in 1121, a Duke \"Odrzanski\" (\"of the Oder\") named Swietopelk died. Some historians have interpreted this to have been the same Swietopolk, son of Świętobór. However, others consider the \"Odrzanski\" Swietopolk to have been a different person, Duke of the Chyżans (Kcynians), whose lands were invaded in 1121 by the Saxon prince Lothar of Supplinburg. Swietopelk had several sons, one of whom served as a hostage at the court of Bolesław Krzywousty. It is possible that this unnamed son was the father of Sobieslaw I, Duke of Pomerania, founder of the Samborides dynasty.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Nicotiana tabacum, or cultivated tobacco, is an annually-grown herbaceous plant.

He was admitted to the bar and moved to Newark, Ohio in 1809 where he started a law practice. He was elected to the Ohio Senate in 1824 and 1825. He was elected a Jacksonian to the United States House of Representatives in 1827 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of William Wilson. He was reelected as a Jacksonian in 1828 and as an Anti-Jacksonian in 1830. During his time in Congress, Stanbery was known to be controversial. In April 1832, Stanbery made accusations about Sam Houston, who was visiting Washington, D.C. at the time, on the floor of the House. He was attacking President Andrew Jackson through Houston and accused him of being in league with John Von Fossen and Robert Rose. The three men bid on the supplying of rations to Indians who were being forcibly removed because of Jackson's Indian Removal Act of 1830. Stanbery, now carrying two pistols and a dirk, refused to answer Houston's letters. Infuriated, Houston later confronted him on Pennsylvania Avenue as he left Mrs. Queen's boardinghouse and beat Stanbery with a hickory cane. Stanbery did manage to draw one of his pistols, place it at Houston's chest and pull the trigger, but it misfired. Congress ordered the arrest of Houston on April 17 who hired Francis Scott Key as his attorney. He pleaded self-defense, but was found guilty in the high-profile trial, however he was only lightly reprimanded thanks to high placed friends, among them James K. Polk. Stanbery then filed charges against Houston in civil court. Judge William Cranch found Houston liable and fined him $500 which he never paid before leaving for Mexican Texas. On July 11, 1832, Stanbery was censured by the House of Representatives for saying of House Speaker Andrew Stevenson that his eye might be \"too frequently turned from the chair you occupy toward the White House.\" Stanbery was defeated for renomination in 1832. Afterwards, he resumed practicing law in Newark where he died on January 23, 1873. He was interred in Cedar Hill Cemetery. William Stanbery's brother Henry Stanbery served as United States Attorney General under Andrew Johnson and resigned to defend Johnson during his impeachment trial.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"<div style=\"float: right; font-size: smaller; background-color:#E6E6FA; padding: 12px; margin-left: 5em; margin-bottom: 2em; width: 180px\" align=\"center\"> Gransito Movie Awards 2007 Best Picture: The Departed <div style=\"padding-left: 15px\"> Best Director: Martin Scorsese Gransito Movie Awards 2007 is the 7th annual edition of GMA, the first Italian online film award.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The table below shows the 2000 Tennis Masters Series schedule.

The NMDA receptor is one of three types of ionotropic glutamate receptors, the others being the AMPA and kainate receptors. It is activated when glutamate and glycine (or D-serine) bind to it, and when activated it allows positively charged ions to flow through the cell membrane. The NMDA receptor is very important for controlling synaptic plasticity and memory function. The NMDAR is a specific type of ionotropic glutamate receptor. The NMDA receptor is so named because the agonist molecule N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) binds selectively to it, and not to other glutamate receptors. Activation of NMDA receptors results in the opening of an ion channel that is nonselective to cations, with a combined reversal potential near 0 mV. While the opening and closing of the ion channel is primarily gated by ligand binding, the current flow through the ion channel is voltage dependent. Extracellular magnesium (Mg 2+ ) and zinc (Zn 2+ ) ions can bind to specific sites on the receptor, blocking the passage of other cations through the open ion channel. Depolarization of the cell dislodges and repels the Mg 2+ and Zn 2+ ions from the pore, thus allowing a voltage-dependent flow of sodium (Na + ) and small amounts of calcium (Ca 2+ ) ions into the cell and potassium (K + ) out of the cell. Ca 2+ flux through NMDARs is thought to be critical in synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism for learning and memory. The opening and closing (gating) of the NMDA receptor is complex. While it is primarily a ligand-gated channel, it does display weaker voltage-dependence modulation of the ligand-dependent gating. The ligand gating requires co-activation by two ligands: glutamate and either D-serine or glycine. The voltage-dependence of current through the channel is mainly due to binding of Mg 2+ or Zn 2+ ions to the protein as described above. The activity of the NMDA receptor is affected by many psychoactive drugs such as phencyclidine (PCP), alcohol (ethanol) and dextromethorphan (DXM). The anaesthetic and analgesic effects of the drugs ketamine and nitrous oxide are partially because of their effects on NMDA receptor activity. In 1972 a possible therapeutic importance of memantine, an adamantane derivative, was discovered for treating neurodegenerative disorders. Since 1989 memantine has been recognized to be an uncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor), entering the channel of the receptor after it has been activated and thereby blocking the flow of ions. The NMDA receptor channels play an important role in synaptic plasticity and synapse formation underlying memory, learning and formation of neural networks during development in the central nervous system (CNS). Overactivation of the receptor, causing excessive influx of Ca 2+ can lead to excitotoxicity which is implied to be involved in some neurodegenerative disorders. Blocking of NMDA receptors could therefore, in theory, be useful in treating such diseases. The main problem with the development of NMDA receptor antagonist for neuroprotection is that the physiological NMDA receptor activity is essential for normal neuronal function. To be clinically accepted the antagonists must block excessive activation without blocking the normal function.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"passwd is a tool on most Unix and Unix-like operating systems used to change a user's password. The password entered by the user is run through a key derivation function to create a hashed version of the new password, which is saved. Only the hashed version is stored; the entered password is not saved for security reasons. When the user logs on, the password entered by the user during the log on process is run through the same key derivation function and the resulting hashed version is compared with the saved version. If the hashes are identical, the entered password is considered to be correct, and the user is authenticated. In theory, it is possible for two different passwords to produce the same hash. However, cryptographic hash functions are designed in such a way that finding any password that produces the same hash is very difficult and practically infeasible, so if the produced hash matches the stored one, the user can be authenticated. The passwd command may be used to change passwords for local accounts, and on most systems, can also be used to change passwords managed in a distributed authentication mechanism such as NIS, Kerberos, or LDAP.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Auguste Honoré Charlois (November 26, 1864 – March 26, 1910) was a French astronomer who discovered 99 asteroids while working at the Nice Observatory in southeastern France.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Air-Sol Moyenne Portée (ASMP; medium-range air to surface missile) is a French nuclear air-launched cruise missile.

The Rangers have the distinction of being the only unit raised in present-day Virginia to serve in the Union Army. The Loudoun Rangers were formed in the spring of 1862, when the Union Army first occupied Loudoun County as part of its campaign in the Shenandoah Valley. Returning with the army was local unionist Samuel Means, who had been run out of the county the previous year by local Confederates. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton issued Means orders to raise a company of men to serve as an independent command, of which he would be captain, for special service in Loudoun and along the Virginia-Maryland border. Recruiting operations were established in the northern Loudoun Valley, an area of strong unionist sentiment, eventually leading to the formation of 2 companies. For the first two years of service the Loudoun Rangers served as partisans, often in conjunction with Cole's Maryland Cavalry (1st Potomac Home Brigade) fighting their confederate counterparts, such as White's Comanches, Mosby's Rangers and John Mobberly's renegade band in and around Loudoun. In 1864 the Rangers were absorbed into regular service, leading to Means' departure. Daniel Keyes subsequently took his place as leader of the outfit. During the final years of the war the Rangers were attached to the Union army in the Shenandoah Valley and took part in the Valley Campaigns of 1864 under General Phillip Sheridan. As the war in the valley came to an end, the Rangers returned to their partisan role and were eventually effectively broken up in April 1865 when a detachment of Mosby's Rangers raided their camp at Castleman's Ferry and captured the better part of the command. The Rangers were officially mustered out of service the following month.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Ugo Poletti (19 April 1914 – 25 February 1997) was an Italian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church who served as Vicar General of Rome from 1973 to 1991, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1973.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Back at the Chicken Shack is an album by Jimmy Smith.

In the lower and upper extremes, some mezzo-sopranos may extend down to the F below middle C (F 3 ) and as high as \"high C\" (C 6 ). The mezzo-soprano voice (unlike the soprano voice) is strong in the middle register and weaker in the head register, resulting in a deeper tone than the soprano voice. The term mezzo-soprano was developed in relation to classical and operatic voices, where the classification is based not merely on the singer's vocal range but also on the tessitura and timbre of the voice. For classical and operatic singers, their voice type determines the roles they will sing and is a primary method of categorization. In non-classical music, singers are primarily defined by their genre and their gender not their vocal range. When the terms soprano, mezzo-soprano, contralto, tenor, baritone, and bass are used as descriptors of non-classical voices, they are applied more loosely than they would be to those of classical singers and generally refer only to the singer's perceived vocal range.

Devoted to Demeter and Persephone, these initiation ceremonies were the most sacred and ancient of all the religious rites celebrated in Greece. At some point in the 5th century BCE, Iktinos, the great architect of the Parthenon, built the Telesterion big enough to hold thousands of people. In about 318 BCE, Philon added a portico with twelve Doric columns. The site of the Telesterion is believed to have had some temple since the 7th century BCE, or the time of the Homeric Hymn to Demeter one of 33 Homeric Hymns (650-550 BCE); the Telesterion had ten different building phases. The Athenians used several calendars, each for different purposes. The festival of Eleusinia was celebrated each year in Eleusis and Athens for nine days from the 15th to the 23rd of the month of Boedromion (in September or October of the Gregorian calendar); because the festival calendar had 12 lunar months, the celebrations were not strictly calibrated to a year of 365 days. During the festival, Athens was crowded with visitors. As the climax of the ceremonies at Eleusis, the initiates entered the Telesterion where they were shown the sacred relics of Demeter and the priestesses revealed their visions of the holy night (probably a fire that represented the possibility of life after death). This was the most secretive part of the Mysteries and those who had been initiated were forbidden to ever speak of the events that took place in the Telesterion. It was destroyed by the Persians after the Battle of Thermopylae, when the Athenians withdrew to Salamis in 480 BCE and all of Boeotia and Attica fell to the Persian army, who captured and burnt Athens. After the defeat of the Persians, the Telesterion was rebuilt some time later by Pericles. In CE 170, during the rule of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, an ancient tribe called the Costoboci launched an invasion of Roman territory south of the Danube, entering Thracia and ravaging the provinces of Macedonia and Achaea (Greece). The Costoboci reached as far south as Eleusis, where they destroyed the Telesterion. The emperor responded by despatching general Vehilius Gratus Iulianus to Greece with emergency reinforcements, who eventually defeated the Costoboci. Marcus Aurelius then had the Telesterion rebuilt.

Assault rifles were first used during World War II. Though Western nations were slow to accept the assault rifle concept, by the end of the 20th century they had become the standard weapon in most of the world's armies, replacing full-powered rifles and sub-machine guns in most roles. Examples include the StG 44, AK-47 and the M16 rifle. The term assault rifle is generally attributed to Adolf Hitler, who for propaganda purposes used the German word \"Sturmgewehr\" (which translates to \"storm rifle\" or \"assault rifle\"), as the new name for the MP43, subsequently known as the Sturmgewehr 44 or StG 44. However, other sources dispute that Hitler had much to do with coining the new name besides signing the production order. The StG 44 is generally considered the first selective fire military rifle to popularize the assault rifle concept. Today, the term assault rifle is used to define firearms sharing the same basic characteristics as the StG 44.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Daria Valeryevna Shkurikhina (, born 3 October 1990) is a Russian group rhythmic gymnast and Olympic champion.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"'''T'ang Haywen''' (Chinese 曾海文, 1927–1991) was a Chinese-born painter who spent most of his professional life in Paris.

Selena received the Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of the Year for nine consecutive years, beginning in 1987. She signed her first major contract with EMI Latin in 1989, releasing four Spanish-language albums which were milestones in the Latin music industry. EMI Latin then wanted her to release a crossover album, transitioning from Spanish- to English-language pop songs. On March 31, 1995, Selena was shot and killed by Yolanda Saldivar, her friend and the former manager of her boutiques. Reaction to her death was compared to the grief following the deaths of musicians John Lennon and Elvis Presley and U.S. president John F. Kennedy. Selena's greatest influences were Donna Summer, Madonna, Gloria Estefan, Paula Abdul and Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson. According to music critics her Tejano sound incorporated contemporary R&B, disco and funk, and her roots in American pop music were believed by Ed Morales to have been inspired by Summer and Diana Ross. Selena credited Michael Jackson for inspiring her to follow in his footsteps after she saw him perform at a 1984 Astrodome concert. Onstage, she wore fashions inspired by Abdul, Madonna and Janet Jackson. Selena's husband, Chris Pérez, said that she was \"open-minded\" toward all musical genres, rock in particular.

The United Kingdom adopts an open telephone numbering plan for its public switched telephone network. Dialling codes do not correspond to specific political boundaries. For example, the Coventry dialling code covers a large area of Warwickshire and the Manchester dialling code covers part or all of several neighbouring towns. ELNS (Extended Linked Numbering Scheme) areas are where an area code is associated with more than one place name. When dialling within the country, all area codes are preceded by the national trunk prefix 0, which has been included in all listings in this article. 0 was traditionally the number dialled for the operator for trunk calls before subscriber trunk dialling (STD) was introduced, and so was retained as a prefix for direct dialled calls. In the majority of areas, the area code still corresponds to the original STD letter code. When dialling from abroad, the 0 prefix is not dialled. When dialling within the same area, the area code is not needed, save for a handful of areas that do require this.

North was born in Leeds, Yorkshire, the son of a coal merchant and a churchwarden. At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to millwrights and engineers before working for several years as a mechanic. He moved to Chile where his first occupation was as a boiler riveter in Huasco. He later moved to the Peruvian town of Iquique where he worked as a waterworks operator, importer and ship owner. The War of the Pacific (1879&ndash;1883) provided North with an opportunity to purchase large numbers of bonds in the Peruvian nitrate industry. When Chile annexed Iquique and the surrounding province of Tarapacá the Chilean government transferred ownership of the nitrate fields to the bondholders. North was thus able to take a monopoly share of the lucrative Chilean nitrate industry for a very small initial investment, becoming known as \"The King of Nitrates\". North built upon his nitrates business by expanding into further monopolies in waterworks and freight railways, but also owned several iron and coal fields. North maintained his monopolies by employing lawyers to block competing entrepreneurs both in court and the Chilean National Congress. This was allowed by Chilean president Domingo Santa María, but Santa María's successor, José Manuel Balmaceda, became concerned that Tarapacá was starting to resemble a \"state within a state\" and resolved to break North's monopoly. Balmaceda had to force competition reforms through against opposition in congress, amongst a series of disputes which would eventually escalate into the 1891 Chilean Civil War between the president and the congress. North also had investments in the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company which operated a concession in the Congo Free State. This company was involved in the extraction and export of rubber from the state, another highly profitable business, but later became involved in abuses of human rights against those under its power.

The MBI takes between 10–15 minutes to complete and can be administered to individuals or groups. Following the publication of the MBI in 1981, new versions of the MBI were gradually developed to fit different groups and different settings. There are five versions of the MBI: Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS), Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel (MBI-HSS (MP)), Educators Survey (MBI-ES), General Survey (MBI-GS), and General Survey for Students (MBI-GS (S)). All MBI versions are protected by copyright law and published by Mind Garden, Inc.An analysis of 84 published studies that report sample-specific reliability estimates for the three MBI scales found that the scales have strong reliability. Since the proposal of the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) perspective on burnout, the MBI has shown strong relationships with job demands and resources. The MBI has been validated for human services populations,   educator populations,   and general work populations.

He said, \"Heredity can tend to run out of ideas.\" Ernst Bach received training in music from his uncle, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, and from another uncle in England, Johann Christian Bach. He was in London when Johann Christian Bach died there on New Year's Day, 1782. Ernst Bach remained in England until 1784 before returning via Holland to Germany. He held a few positions, namely those of Kapellmeister of Minden in 1786, and from 1788 to 1811 as Kapellmeister in Berlin with the blessing of King Friedrich Wilhelm II. Ernst Bach retired from his position after prince Heinrich, the brother of the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III granted him a pension. Ernst Bach married twice. He had two daughters by his first wife, who died young, and a son by his second wife. When WFE's only son died in infancy, the event served to extinguish the long line of musical Bachs. At the unveiling of the Bach Monument in Leipzig on 23 April 1843, Ernst Bach met Robert Schumann. Schumann later described Ernst Bach as \"a very agile old gentleman of 84 years with snow-white hair and expressive features.\" One of Ernst Bach's most remarkable compositions was Dreyblatt, a concerto for piano involving six hands. He wrote it in such a way in that it was to be performed with one large male in the middle with a petite female on either side of him. Ernst Bach indicated that the man was to stretch his arms around the ladies to play the outside parts, while the ladies performed the middle parts.

It was defined by Susan L. Smith as \"the representational practice of bringing together at least two, but usually more, well-known figures from the Bible, ancient history, or romance to exemplify a cluster of interrelated themes that include the wiles of women, the power of love, and the trials of marriage\".  Smith argues that the topos is not simply a \"straightforward manifestation of medieval antifeminism\"; rather, it is \"a site of contest through which conflicting ideas about gender roles could be expressed\".  Smith argues the topos originates in classical literature and finds it in medieval texts such as Aucassin et Nicolette, The Consolation of Philosophy, the Roman de la Rose, and the Canterbury Tales.  The topos was attacked by Christine de Pizan around 1400, who argued that if women wrote these accounts their interpretations would be different from those of men. In the visual arts, images are found in various media, mainly from the 14th century onwards, and becoming increasingly popular in the 15th century. By then the frequently recurring subjects include Judith beheading Holofernes, Phyllis riding Aristotle, Samson and Delilah, Salome and her mother Herodias, Jael killing Sisera, Bathsheba bathing in sight of David, the idolatry of Solomon, Virgil in his basket, as well as many depictions of witches, and genre images of wives dominating their husbands. The last group came to be called the battle for the trousers. Joseph and Potiphar's wife and Lot and his Daughters were somewhat late joiners to the group, but increasingly popular later on. Tomyris, the Scythian queen who defeated Cyrus the Great and abused his corpse, was painted by Rubens and several Italians. These scenes, mostly shown in consistent compositions involving just two persons and visually distinctive actions, were easily recognisable and seem to have also been represented dramatically in entertainments of various sorts, whether as short scenes or tableaux vivants.

The extended trunk is a water storage device for survival in a warm dry climate. The bell-shaped flowers are variable in colour (pale to pink) while the leaves vary considerably in shape. The leaves are either simple and pointed, or may be 3–9 lobed. Saplings grow from a drought and fire resistant tap-rooted tuber. The Kurrajong has multiple uses and was used by many Australian Aboriginal clans and tribes around Australia. The seeds located in a seed pod were often removed and cleaned of the fine hairs with in the seed pod and was often roasted. Water could be obtained from the tree roots by boring a hole in the trunk and squeezing the wood. There has also been records of the seedpods being turned into a children's rattle or toy. The soft spongy wood was used for making shields, and the bark as a fibre. The leaves are also used as emergency fodder for drought-affected animal stock. There has also been records of European setters using the seeds as a coffee supplement by roasting and crushing the seeds. It has been introduced as an ornamental tree to south-western Australia, South Africa, Louisiana, California, Arizona and Mediterranean countries. In Western Australia it was observed to be invasive in disturbed areas. Horticulturists have hybridised the Kurrajong with related Brachychiton species, including the Queensland bottle tree (B. rupestris) and Illawarra Flame Tree (B. acerifolius) to produce new garden ornamentals. The specific name populneus pertains to a perceived similarity to genus Populus, the Poplars. Sometimes ''B. populneus'' is also known by the names \"lacebark kurrajong\" and \"bottle tree\" (USA). However, B. discolor is also referred to as the Lacebark Kurrajong, and Bottle Tree is a term commonly applied not only to other species of Brachychiton but to members of other genera around the world. The kurrajong has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species Dendrophthoe glabrescens.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Sinnissippi Mounds are a Havana Hopewell culture burial mound grouping located in the city of Sterling, Illinois, United States.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Stephen Joseph Milosz (born 26 December 1955, Northam, Western Australia) is a former Australian cricketer, who played for the Western Australia from 1983-84 to 1985-86, and then played for Tasmania from 1986–87, before returning to Western Australia for his final first-class season in 1987-88.

Two vessels, the left aorta and the pulmonary artery, exit the right ventricle. Blood from the right ventricle goes to the lungs through the pulmonary artery, as in mammals and birds. However, when a unique active valve leading to the pulmonary artery contracts, pressure in the right ventricle can increase and blood can leave the right ventricle, enter the left aortic arch, and therefore bypass the pulmonary circulation. The foramen of Panizza connects the left and right aorta. Deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle, sitting in the left aorta, can flow into the right aorta through the foramen of Panizza. When the heart is relaxed, some oxygenated blood from the left ventricle, sitting in the right aorta, can flow into the left aorta across the foramen of Panizza.

Geologic structures prone to spontaneous cave-ins include alvar, tsingy and other limestone formations, but can also include lava tubes and a variety of other subsurface rock formations. Glacier caves and other ice formations are very prone to collapse from exposure to warm temperatures or running water. In mining, the term roof fall is used to refer to many types of collapses, ranging from the fall of a single flake of shale to collapses that form sink holes that reach to the surface. However, roof falls in mining are not all accidental. In longwall mining and retreat mining, miners systematically remove all support from under large areas of the mine roof, allowing it to settle just beyond the work area. The goal in such mining methods is not to prevent roof fall and the ensuing surface subsidence, but rather to control it.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"1892 V may refer to:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"'Everything Bad Is Good for You: How Today's Popular Culture Is Actually Making Us Smarter' is a non-fiction book written by Steven Johnson.

It was featured in the album England Made Me. The song features a mixture of spoken word and a sung chorus. The spoken word tells of various incidents from childhood, including refusing to talk, expulsion from school for disruptive behaviour and parents arguing at Christmas. The sung chorus featured a highly controversial line, \"Life is unfair, kill yourself or get over it\". This led to the song being banned on UK radio (with the exception of Xfm who gave it some daytime airplay) and MTV. However, the sardonic nature of the song also gained praise from critics, with one calling it 'refreshingly blunt'. The chorus was featured in a series 3 episode of Monkey Dust and in the season 1 episode 19 of the Gilmore Girls entitled \"Emily in Wonderland\", and consequently featured on the Gilmore Girls soundtrack, Our Little Corner of the World. The song was released in the US shortly after the Columbine massacre, this led to the line 'Kill Yourself' being played backwards on the US release.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Joseph Peyton Wyatt Jr. (born October 12, 1941) served as a U.S. Representative from Texas.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Gmina Szczutowo is a rural gmina (administrative district) in Sierpc County, Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central Poland.

Named after the first president and vice-president of Indonesia, Soekarno and Mohammad Hatta, the airport is located at Benda, Tangerang, approximately 20 km northwest of central Jakarta. Due to its proximity to the neighbourhood of Cengkareng in West Jakarta, the airport is also known as Cengkareng Airport, with the assigned three-letter IATA designator \"CGK\". The airport is the busiest and the largest airport in Indonesia, as well as being the busiest in the southern hemisphere and one of the busiest airports in world. The airport was ranked as 8th busiest airport in the world by Airports Council International in 2013. The airport, together with the 2nd airport Jakarta Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport served more than 70 million passengers of Greater Jakarta in 2017. According to air travel intelligence company OAG, the airport ranked as the 7th most connected airport in the world & ranked 1st as 'megahub' airport in Asia-Pacific region as per connectivity index, ahead of Japan's Tokyo Haneda Airport and Australia's Sydney Airport. The airport ranked as the 7th most connected airport as 'megahub' in the world in 2017 again by air travel intelligence company OAG. The airport commenced domestic operations in 1985 replacing the old over capacity Kemayoran Airport. The airport was expanded by 1991 to replace Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport for international flights, with Halim only having been commissioned as a temporary solution until Soekarno–Hatta was completed. Kemayoran Airport has since been demolished and is now a planned mixed development neighborhood, where as Halim still serves domestic charter, VIP, and private flights, and re-opened as second commercial airport for domestic flights to relieve Soekarno–Hatta which is running over capacity, due to the rapid growth of airline travel in Indonesia. The airport often struggles to accommodate all flights at its current limit of 81 aircraft movements per hour. Although over capacity, after a survey from April 23 to May 3 the Airport Council International (ACI) stated on May 4, 2012 that Soekarno–Hatta International Airport is being operated safely. The two existing runways suffer from pavement and strength issues, which limits the airport's capacity to serve large aircraft. To reduce congestion and to achieve a target to handle 100 flights/hour, works for a 3rd runway is currently going on, which is expected to open in 2018. Upgrading of existing two runways are almost completed for safe operation and to accommodate wide-bodied aircraft at the airport. The airport will be able to serve 100 million passengers annually by 2025 after completion of ongoing development work.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Perseus cluster (Abell 426) is a cluster of galaxies in the constellation Perseus.
