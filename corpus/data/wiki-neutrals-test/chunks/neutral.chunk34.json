Haitians of Apparent Project create stunning bracelets, jewelry, clothing, and beautiful art pieces made out of trash, metal, aluminum, dirt, and paper by the mothers and fathers of once orphaned children of Haiti. Currently The Apparent Projects artisans include metal sculptors, jewelry makers, paper makers, bookbinders, seamstresses, and ceramicists. They are looking to expand into new artistic ventures and love hosting small teams for intensive trainings.They produce jobs for mothers and fathers who don’t want to have to abandon their children to an orphanage because of extreme poverty. They provide hope through the dignity of a job, training, and the ability to create something new out of something discarded and seemingly unusable. Apparent Project is a socially and ecologically conscious business with a mission of stimulating the Haitian economy and bringing an end to poverty-based relinquishment of children in Haiti. Apparent Project is the business incubator for start-up businesses that help aid in the economic situation of families in Haiti. Apparent Project also does community development, education, job skills training, medical relief, prenatal care, and continues to market and promote Papillon goods as well as other Haitian artisan goods through its party sales and fundraisers. While redeeming the Haitian landscape, these artisans are also bringing new hope to their families, employing themselves for a brighter future and earning the means to pay for their children’s food, shelter, and education. Apparent Project’s goal is to see Haitian families stay together. Skill development and employment addresses the needs of families before they are at the point of desperation, driven to give their children to an orphanage because of extreme poverty. They see their artisans’ guild as an “un-orphanage. ” They are finding creative ways for Haitians to be self-employed so that they can take care of their own children with dignity and joy.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Academy of Doom (also known as Mil Mascaras: Academy of Doom) is a 2008 Mexican-American lucha libre film starring the legendary Mexican wrestler and film star Mil Máscaras.

In 1844, Evans, trade unionist John Windt, former Chartist Thomas Devyr and others founded the National Reform Association, which lobbied Congress and sought political supporters with the slogan \"Vote Yourself a Farm.\" Between 1844 and 1862, Congress received petitions signed by 55,000 Americans calling for free public lands for homesteaders. Free land was depicted as a means of attracting the excessive eastern population westward, and, as a result, bringing about higher wages and better working conditions for the laboring man in the eastern industrial areas. For many years the public domain had been regarded as the safety valve of the American political and economic order. (Bronstein, 1999). The efforts of Evans and his allies—notably Horace Greeley—led to the Homestead Act of 1862. Evans, thus, deserves the title of \"Father of the Homestead Act.\" Evans was a publisher, and the editor of a series of radical newspapers including: ''Workingman's Advocate (1829–36, 1844–45), The Man (1834), The Radical (1841–43), The People's Rights (1844), and Young America'' (1845–49).

Commonly referred to as the \"Triple Seven\", its distinguishing features include the largest-diameter turbofan engines of any aircraft, long raked wings, six wheels on each main landing gear, fully circular fuselage cross-section, and a blade-shaped tail cone. Developed in consultation with eight major airlines, the 777 was designed to replace older wide-body airliners and bridge the capacity difference between Boeing's 767 and 747. As Boeing's first fly-by-wire airliner, it has computer-mediated controls. It was also the first commercial aircraft to be designed entirely with computer-aided design. The 777 is produced in two fuselage lengths . The original 777-200 variant entered commercial service in 1995, followed by the extended-range 777-200ER in 1997. The stretched 777-300, which is longer, followed in 1998. The initial 777-200, extended-range -200ER, and -300 versions are equipped with General Electric GE90, Pratt & Whitney PW4000, or Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines. They have since been collectively referred to as 777 Classics. The extended-range 777-300ER and ultra long-range 777-200LR variants entered service in 2004 and 2006 respectively, while the 777F, a freighter version, debuted in February 2009; these second generation variants all feature high-output GE90 engines and extended raked wingtips. The 777-200LR is one of the world's longest-range airliners, able to fly more than halfway around the globe and holds the record for the longest distance flown non-stop by a commercial aircraft. In November 2013, Boeing announced the development of the third-generation of the 777, the 777X, consisting of the 777-8 and 777-9 \"mini-jumbo jet\" variants. The 777X features composite folding wings and GE9X engines plus further technologies developed for the Boeing 787, and scheduled to enter service by 2020. The 777 first entered commercial service with United Airlines on June 7, 1995. The 777 has received more orders than any other wide-body airliner; as of December 2017, more than 60 customers had placed orders for 1,962 aircraft of all variants, with 1,534 delivered. The most common and successful variant is the 777-300ER with 767 delivered and 839 orders; Emirates operates the largest 777 fleet, with 161 passenger and freighter aircraft as of July 2017. The 777 has been involved in six hull losses as of October 2016; the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 accident in July 2013 was its first fatal crash in 18 years of service and the shootdown of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July 2014 was its deadliest crash. The 777 ranks as one of Boeing's best-selling models. Airlines have acquired the type as a comparatively fuel-efficient alternative to other wide-body jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on long-haul transoceanic routes. Direct market competitors include the Airbus A330-300, the Airbus A350 XWB, and the out-of-production A340 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11.

Even though Nikolayevka was not near the ocean, Zagoskin would eventually train for the Russian Navy and served as a naval officer in the Baltic and Caspian seas. He would subsequently receive training in mineralogy, zoology, botany, and entomology from Russian scientist I.G. Voznesensky In 1799, Russia formed the Russian America Company and gave it monopolistic powers over the region now known as Alaska as part of their colonization effort. Early Russian explorers like Vitus Bering, Mikhail Gvozdev, and Georg Steller provided knowledge of the coastal region, however by the 1840s very little was known about the interior of the colony. Such knowledge was desired in the hopes of expanding the commercial opportunities for the Russian America Company. Zagoskin was given a two-year assignment to conduct reconnaissance of the region to help determine the most profitable and convenient sites for forts and trading posts in the region - an assignment he was well suited for given his background and in fact a mission he had proposed. In 1842 and 1843, he traveled extensively on the Yukon, Kuskokwim, Innoko and Koyukuk Rivers all told traveling over .

It was also known as the X-70 on the Japanese market, in which it was not available until 1982. When released, it was the top model in Minolta's XG series of consumer-grade manual focus SLRs, replacing the XG-9. Changes from that model included a metered manual mode (the XG-9's meter was switched off in manual), and a revised body style with rearranged controls. This was also the first camera to use Minolta's new logo, which was used until the 2003 merger into Konica Minolta. The body style became Minolta's standard manual-focus SLR body, so the XG-M strongly resembles subsequent Minolta cameras. Body changes from the XG-9 included a new right hand handgrip and stronger internal build allowing the use of a 3.5fps motor drive while the XG bodies were only able to use a 2fps winder. The XG-9's integrated switch for on/off/self-timer/battery check was removed and its functions spread around the camera. The self timer was relocated to a switch on the front of the camera, on the left-hand side of the mirror housing. A new main on-off switch was placed beneath the shutter speed dial. The lock button for the shutter speed dial also functioned as a battery check; the front LED, also used for the self-timer, lit when that button was pressed and the batteries held adequate charge. Film speed and exposure compensation settings were moved to beneath the rewind knob. The XG-M supported both aperture priority autoexposure and full manual mode. For aperture priority shooting, the shutter speed dial was set to the A (auto) position. The photographer would set the aperture on the lens, which would be visible in the viewfinder by means of a small periscope beneath the image. The camera would decide on the correct shutter speed according to the reading of its center-weighted average metering. This would be displayed in the viewfinder: a column on the right of the image showed all the shutter speeds, and an LED would light next to the chosen speed. The automatically selected exposure could be adjusted by means of the exposure compensation dial on the left; compensation of plus or minus 2 stops could be selected in half-stop increments. In manual mode, the XG-M would use that LED to display its recommended shutter speed. However, to select a shutter speed, the camera had to be removed from the eye; the speed selected was not shown in the viewfinder. Speeds between 1 second and 1/1000 second could be chosen, and there was a BULB mode for long-duration exposures. The camera was battery dependent, needing 2 LR44 or equivalent button cells to operate. A minimal amount of photographic flash automation was provided. With a compatible dedicated flash, the camera would be set automatically to the 1/60 second X-sync speed, and a ready light in the viewfinder would blink when the flash was charged. The photographer did have to set the correct aperture for flash photography according to subject distance; a guide was available on the back of Minolta's flashes.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Since 1959, the Oscar Mathisen Award (also known as the Oscar Mathisen Memorial Award, the Oscar Mathisen Memorial Trophy, and sometimes the Skating Oscar) is awarded annually for outstanding speed skating performance of the season.

It was first found and described in Styria, Austria, on Mount Hochschwab around 1700. Although it was initially classified as a subspecies of P. alcon, a European researcher, Lucien A. Berger, designated it as a separate species in 1946. Genetic similarities between ''P. rebeli and P. alcon'' have led many researchers to argue that the two are the same species and differences are due to intraspecific variation. Although ''P. rebeli'' is found across the Palearctic (see subspecies), it is difficult to determine the species' precise range due to confusion with ''P. alcon''. Behavioral ecologists have found its role as a brood parasite to be of particular interest as, unlike many brood parasites, it does not directly oviposit in the hosts' nests. P. rebeli parasitizes the colony ant species Myrmica schencki as a larva by using chemical mimicry to trick the ants into believing that they are ant larvae; thus, the ants bring ''P. rebeli'' caterpillars back to their nests and feed them. P. rebeli is dependent on the plant Gentiana cruciata early in its life cycle and is vulnerable to parasitism by Ichneumon eumerus while inside the nest of ''M. schencki''. It was placed on the IUCN Red List in 2000 and is classified as a species vulnerable to extinction.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"James R.

The rocky rias coast of Iwate Prefecture was densely settled from the early through late Jōmon period, and the locations of such coastal settlements are often marked by shell middens containing shellfish, fish, animal and whale bones and human-produced artifacts, including earthenware shards, fishing hooks, etc. In particular, the deeply indented Ōfunato Bay area was a rich fishing ground and is the location of 16 known Jōmon-period shell middens, a number of which have been designated National Historic Sites. The Ōhora Shell Midden dates from the late Jōmon period, and is located at an elevation of 31 meters above the present sea level, on a small peninsula on the east side of the bay. The midden consists of two separate groups of mounds, which were first excavated in 1925 by the Tohoku Imperial University and again in 2002.

The shell middens are between a grouping of kofun to the east and the remains of a residential area to the west, which is in turn surrounded by more shell middens on its far side, indicating a very long period of residency. In some cases, the middens were over one meter in thickness.

Something that is bistable can be resting in either of two states. These rest states need not be symmetric with respect to stored energy. In terms of potential energy, a bistable system has two local minima of potential energy separated by a peak (local maximum). An example of a mechanical device which is bistable is a light switch. The switch lever is designed to rest in the \"on\" or \"off\" position, but not between the two. In a conservative force field, bistability stems from the fact that the potential energy has three equilibrium points. Two of them are minima and one is a maximum. By mathematical arguments, the maximum must lie between the two minima. At rest, a particle will be in one of the minimum equilibrium positions, because that corresponds to the state of lowest energy. The maximum can be visualized as a barrier between them. A system can transition from one state of minimal energy to the other if it is given enough activation energy to penetrate the barrier (compare activation energy and Arrhenius equation for the chemical case). After the barrier has been reached, the system will relax into the other minimum state in a time called the relaxation time. Bistability is widely used in digital electronics devices to store binary data. It is the essential characteristic of the flip-flop, a circuit widely used in latches and some types of semiconductor memory. A bistable device can store one bit of binary data, with one state representing a \"0\" and the other state a \"1\". It is also used in relaxation oscillators, multivibrators, and the Schmitt trigger. Optical bistability is an attribute of certain optical devices where two resonant transmissions states are possible and stable, dependent on the input. Bistability can also arise in biochemical systems, where it creates digital, switch-like outputs from the constituent chemical concentrations and activities. It is often associated with hysteresis in such systems.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Burnsville is a town in Tishomingo County in northeastern Mississippi, United States.

IgE is synthesised by plasma cells. Monomers of IgE consist of two heavy chains (ε chain) and two light chains, with the ε chain containing 4 Ig-like constant domains (Cε1-Cε4). IgE's main function is immunity to parasites such as helminths like Schistosoma mansoni, Trichinella spiralis, and Fasciola hepatica. IgE is utilized during immune defense against certain protozoan parasites such as Plasmodium falciparum. IgE also has an essential role in type I hypersensitivity, which manifests in various allergic diseases, such as allergic asthma, most types of sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, food allergies, and specific types of chronic urticaria and atopic dermatitis. IgE also plays a pivotal role in responses to allergens, such as: anaphylactic drugs, bee stings, and antigen preparations used in desensitization immunotherapy. Although IgE is typically the least abundant isotype&mdash;blood serum IgE levels in a normal (\"non-atopic\") individual are only 0.05% of the Ig concentration, compared to 75% for the IgGs at 10 mg/ml, which are the isotypes responsible for most of the classical adaptive immune response&mdash;it is capable of triggering the most powerful inflammatory reactions.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Socialistisk Folkepartis Ungdom (Popular Socialist Youth of Denmark) is the youth wing of the Socialist People's Party of Denmark, founded in 1969.

The British colonial government maintained diplomatic relations with the Qing Government from the point of view of national relations, and the Qing embassies in Singapore and Penang became obstructions for the revolutionary activities. On the other side, the diplomats of the Qing Government visited areas of Malaya, and were welcomed by the local Chinese residents. These diplomats lobbied for local Chinese loyalty to the Qing Government; some of them sold government positions to achieve these goals. Hu Hanmin described the Chinese in the Southeast Asia as \"Anyone that had some sort of official positions under the Manchus can go to Southeast Asia and bluff, saying \"The three generations of my family were all first-grade officials, and I'm also a significant official with luxurious government headgear!\", and these bluffs will create a sensation in the local Chinese to adore you. From Hu Hanmin's description, it is apparent that the Chinese in Malaya were still influenced by conservative ideas. These conservative ideas helped the royalists led by Kang Youwei to win responses from the local Chinese residents. The royalists led by Kang Youwei and the revolutionaries led by Sun Yat-sen were vastly different in the idea of establishing a new system of applying remittance, and because of this, these two parties had a large-scale debate on the converge of remittance in Southeast Asia. The royalists and the revolutionaries both had their own papers, and on their paper was surrounded by intense debates on the topics of constitutional monarchy and democratic revolution. In these debates, the local upper class Chinese were the supporters of the royalists, as they wanted their fortune to remain unaffected, and supported the royalists to protect their own interest. The lower class such as store clerks, merchants, miners and other civilians were the supporters of the revolutionaries. The debates first began in Singapore, and the papers that supported the royalists included \"Xin Bao\" and \"Tian Nan Xin Bao\" while the revolutionaries had the support of \"Zhong Xing Daily\" and \"Zhong Hui Xin Bao\". In Malaya, Huang Jinqing established \"Penang Daily\" in 1906, and it became the first paper of the revolutionaries in Penang. Sun Yat-sen made Penang the headquarters of the Nanyang Tongmenghui from 1909 to 1911. Among his most important supporters in Penang were Wu Shirong (Goh Say Eng), Huang Jingqing (Ng Kim Kheng) and Chen Xinzheng (Tan Sing Cheng). At this time, the Penang chapter of the Tongmenghui was the most active in Malaya, organising many activities under the cover of the Penang Philomatic Union at 120 Armenian Street (now the Sun Yat Sen Museum Penang). Sun Yat-sen convened the 1910 Penang Conference to plan the Second Guangzhou Uprising, the most important event organised by the Tongmenghui. On 10 December 1910, Sun Yat-sen, Chen Xinzheng and Zhuang Yinan established Guang Hua Daily (Kwong Wah Yit Poh). Guang Hua Daily was not only an important apparatus paper of the revolutionaries in Malaya, and became the longest running paper in Malaysian newspaper history and Chinese newspaper history around the world. The meaning of Guang Hua is \"To restore China\", and was approved by Sun Yat-sen himself.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Gaillon is a commune in the Eure department in northern France.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Linden is a municipality in the district of Kaiserslautern, in Rhineland-Palatinate, western Germany.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Ringsberg () is a municipality in the district of Schleswig-Flensburg, in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Abbey of Saint-Evroul or Saint-Evroul-sur-Ouche (Saint-Evroult-sur-Ouche, Saint-Evroul-en-Ouche, Saint-Evroult-en-Ouche, Abbaye de Saint-Evroult, Sanctus Ebrulphus Uticensis ) is a former Benedictine abbey in Normandy, located in the present commune of Saint-Evroult-Notre-Dame-du-Bois, Orne, Normandy.

He composed it in Weimar for the Sunday Sexagesimae, the second Sunday before Lent, likely by 1713. The cantata is based on a text by Erdmann Neumeister published in 1711. While at Weimar Bach set at least one other cantata text by this librettist; he also set others by the court poet Salomon Franck. The text cites Isaiah, related to the gospel, the parable of the Sower. The third movement is in the style of a sermon, combined with a litany by Martin Luther. The closing chorale is the eighth stanza of Lazarus Spengler's hymn \"\".The cantata falls relatively early in Bach's chronology of cantata compositions. It was possibly composed for performance on 24 February 1715, but more likely for a year or even two earlier. Sexagesima always falls within January or February, so the title's reference to snowfall would have been relevant to the weather at the time. Bach structured the work in five movements, a sinfonia, a recitative, a recitative with chorale, an aria and a closing chorale. He scored it for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir only in the chorale, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble which is unusual in having violas but no violins. The instruments originally specified were four violas, cello, bassoon and basso continuo. When he performed the work again as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, he added two recorders to double viola I and II an octave higher, thus creating a lighter sound overall.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Aghla More () is a mountain in County Donegal, Ireland with a height of 584 metres.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Bertrade or Bertrada may refer to:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The 3000 (formally the Laser 3000) is a racing sailing dinghy crewed by two persons with a trapeze for the crew. Launched in 1996 as the Laser 3000, the 3000 was developed from the Laser 2, using the original Frank Bethwaite-designed planing hull combined with a new designed self-draining deck by Derek Clark. Clark also re-designed the rig, using spars and sails from premium proprietary sources and replacing the symmetric spinnaker of the Laser 2 by a larger asymmetric spinnaker (gennaker). The gennaker is chute-launched and retrieved using a single halyard line, and is set on a retractable bowsprit. Helm balance and handling were improved using a shorter-footed mainsail with two full-width battens giving a larger roach. A mast with conventional spreaders replaced the now-unusual diamond arrangement of the Laser 2. The 3000 offers fast, exciting yet easy sailing, particularly for lighter sailors - couples, parent-child and teenage combinations are common at 3000 events. A modest rig size and forgiving nature means that if other classes are sailing on a windy day, any reasonably competently crewed 3000 will be able to join them and enjoy a sparkling sail. :The 3000 class organises racing for both the original boats built by Laser alongside boats sometimes tagged 'V3000' and currently built to the same design by VanderCraft. The latter are constructed from woven glass and epoxy resin using vacuum-bagging to produce a boat which is very stiff and light yet durable. The mast on current boats uses externally run rigging to enable their being sealed and thus buoyant, reducing any tendency for the boat to invert in a capsize. Other innovations introduced with the boats included a centrally mounted bowsprit, a compression-strut kicker or 'Gnav' in place of the conventional kicking strap or boom vang, and ‘off-the-boom’ sheeting with a take-off block at mid-boom fed from an aft bridle. The latter two rigging variations give considerably more room in the boat for the crew members, and remove any objections levelled at the original boats of being cramped due to their centre-bridle and conventional kicker. The class rules permit all variations introduced since the original Laser 3000 to be retro-fitted to existing boats, which can generally be done with minimal trouble or expense. While the original Hyde sails from Laser have proved to be still competitive, North Sails now offer an alternative using the latest cloth technology. North jibs are somewhat larger and require mounting right at the bow; a furlable Dacron jib is offered, as well as a Mylar jib which is battened and a little larger still. The boat is easy to sail singlehanded, optionally using the jib, gennaker and/or trapeze, the latter being easy to use thanks to the deck layout and lack of racks. Most boats are sailed two-up, however, and class events presently cater for this crew format. The class association organises open meetings, including a national championships and, recently, coaching days. The atmosphere at all these events is friendly, with lots of advice available for newcomers.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The World of Karl Pilkington is the first book written and illustrated by Karl Pilkington, and contains transcripts from The Ricky Gervais Show podcasts and excerpts from his own diary, as well as drawings and some original material illustrated by Pilkington himself.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb used it in 2007 to designate a utopian type of society where the leadership possesses epistemic humility. He claims the French writer Michel de Montaigne was a modern epistemocrat. He points out, however, that it is difficult to assert authority on the basis of one's uncertainty; leaders who are assertive, even if they are incorrect, still gather people together. However the term had already been used long before this, and Taleb's usage has not caught on. Most uses of the word are unrelated or even opposite to this. For instance in reference to communism: \"Maoism, like the Marxist- Leninist system upon which it modeled itself, was an `epistemocracy,' rule by those possessed of that infallible wisdom embodied in the `universal truth of Marxism'\" Or theocracy: \"The model for this concentration of knowledge in the hands of a single group is the epistemocracy of the Old Testament priests...\" Another use seems to be in relation to modern science or western technocracy: \"...the social promotion and political em-powerment of a new class of experimental scientists ... what sociologists of science like Blumenberg call an epistemocracy.\" Again this is more or less opposite to Taleb's use. However it would be unfair to say that any of these have exactly caught on either. It remains a word used in an ad hoc manner.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Richard Robert Jeffrey (born 24 November 1917) was a British bobsledder who competed in the late 1940s.

It was developed in the 1960s by Clive Granger and André Gabor. It is a variant of monadic price testing. To use the Gabor-Granger method in a survey, one must find the highest price that respondents are willing to pay. There are many ways to do this but the most common is usually done by choosing 5 price points for the survey and then asking the respondent a 5-point purchase intent question for a random price from those 5 established price points. If the respondent answers in the top 2 choices - 'Definitely Buy' or 'Probably Buy' for this question, they are then asked the same question for a random price that is higher than was just asked. If it is not in the top 2 then the respondent is asked the same question for a random lower price. This is done until you find the highest price the respondent is in top 2 on Purchase Intent Scale. If they are not in top 2 for the lowest of the 5 prices, the respondent is usually coded as a zero or deleted from the analysis. For example, say the 5 prices chosen are $1, $2, $3, $4 and $5. A first random chosen price might be $4. If the respondent is in top 2 on purchase intent, then there is only $5 left higher so the respondent is asked purchase intent at that price. If they are in top 2 on $5 then the respondent is coded $5 as this is the highest price they are in top 2 to pay. If they are not in top 2 on $5 then the respondent is coded as $4 as this was the highest price they are willing to pay. If the respondent is not top 2 on $4, then they are asked a random lower price. Continue until you have found the highest price the respondent is willing to pay among the price points. This is your Gabor-Granger variable. Once you have this Gabor-Granger variable, the results can be used to produce a demand chart (where x-axis are the prices and y axis the percentage of people willing to pay that price) and a revenue curve (where y-axis is the percentage of optimal revenue and x-axis is still price).","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Sadhu Mirandaal (If the Meek Get Angered) is a 2008 Tamil suspense comedy film directed by Siddique, starring Prasanna, Kavya Madhavan and Abbas in the lead roles.

Despite the leopard's (Panthera pardus) extensive range from sub-Saharan Africa to Southeast Asia, attacks are regularly reported only in India and Nepal. Among the five \"big cats\", leopards are less likely to become man-eaters—only jaguars and snow leopards have a less fearsome reputation. However, leopards are established predators of non-human primates, sometimes preying on species as large as the western lowland gorilla. Other primates may make up 80% of the leopard's diet. While leopards generally avoid humans, they tolerate proximity to humans better than lions and tigers and often come into conflict with humans when raiding livestock. Leopard attacks may have peaked in India during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, coinciding with rapid urbanization. Attacks in India are still relatively common, and in some regions of the country leopards kill more humans than all other large carnivores combined. The Indian states of Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, and West Bengal experience the most severe human–leopard conflict. In Nepal, most attacks occur in the midland regions (the Terai, midhills, and lesser Himalaya). One study concluded that the rate of leopard predation on humans in Nepal is 16 times higher than anywhere else, resulting in approximately 1.9 human deaths annually per million inhabitants. In the former Soviet Central Asia, leopard attacks have been reported in the Caucasus, Turkmenia (present day Turkmenistan), and the Lankaran region of present-day Azerbaijan. Rare attacks have occurred in China. It is possible for humans to win a fight against a leopard, as in the case of a 56-year-old woman who killed an attacking leopard with a sickle and spade, and survived with heavy injuries, and the case of a 73-year-old man in Kenya who fatally tore the tongue out of a leopard. Globally, attacks on humans—especially nonfatal attacks that result in only minor injury—likely remain under-reported due to the lack of monitoring programs and standardized reporting protocol.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Sumneytown is an unincorporated community on Route 63 in Marlborough Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States.

It serves as the singer's first record with Dimension Point—a sub-label through Avex Trax—on July 10, 2013 in three physical formats, and for digital consumption. The album was primarily handled by Western producers, such as Zedd, Dsign Music, Anthony Maniscalco, Steven Lee, amongst others. Stylistically, Feel encompasses a wide range of mid-to-uptempo electronic dance styles including electropop, house, and contemporary dance music, and focuses on themes of love, having fun, and empowerment. Feel received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Majority of the reviews praised the singer's transition into dance music, and complimented the album's polished production, whereas some felt certain tracks lacked innovation and surprise. Commercially, the album was a success in Japan, peaking at number one on the Oricon Albums Chart and Billboard Hot Albums Sales Chart. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 250,000 units, and sold over 400,000 copies in total. The album experienced success in other Asian territories, charting in both South Korea and Taiwan respectively. In order to promote the album, Amuro released five singles: \"Big Boys Cry\" and \"Beautiful\" were distributed as a double A-side bundle, but resulted in being one of her lowest-selling efforts in Japan. Additionally, three digital recordings—\"Contrail\", \"Hands on Me\" and \"Heaven\"—experienced success on digital charts throughout the same region.

The episode was directed by Keith Boak and written by Russell T Davies who was also one of the three executive producers. It was first broadcast in the UK on BBC One on 26 March 2005. \"Rose\" was the first Doctor Who episode to air since the Doctor Who television film in 1996. The plot involves Rose Tyler meeting the Doctor, a time-travelling alien Time Lord. She first encounters him in the department store where she works, while being attacked by Autons – living plastic in the guise of shop window mannequins. Rose and the Doctor uncover and defeat a plot by the alien Nestene Consciousness, which aimed to take over the Earth using the living plastic, after which she accepts the Doctor's offer to travel through time and space with him in his time machine, the TARDIS. The episode marked the debut of Christopher Eccleston, the ninth actor to play the Doctor since the programme started in 1963, and Billie Piper as Rose Tyler, the Doctor's companion. Being the first episode of the revived series, several lead characters were introduced: Camille Coduri as Jackie Tyler, and Noel Clarke as Mickey Smith. Viewers did not see the Doctor character regenerate from a previous incarnation, regeneration being a plot device in which the character of the Doctor changes body and identity. Russell T Davies felt it would be clearer for the viewer to begin the series with the new actor in place rather than show the previous actor regenerating. \"Rose\" began filming in Cardiff, the headquarters of BBC Wales, in July 2004, with some location scenes shot in London. \"Rose\" was viewed by 10.81 million viewers in the UK, the most viewed Doctor Who episode since The Creature from the Pit in 1979 (making it the first episode in over 25 years), and received positive reviews from critics, though there were some criticisms of its use of humour.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Neuenburg may refer to:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Astronomical Observatory of Trieste ( or OAT) is an astronomical center of studies located in the city of Trieste in northern Italy.

The expressway was supposed to connect the Western Region Megapolis project with the \"Greater Kandy Development Project\" both projects were also cancelled after the fall of the government. In November 2013 the Project Minister for Highways announced that construction work on the expressway now known as the Northern Expressway would commence in January 2015. The first phase of the works will link the E03 expressway at Kadawatha through to Kurunegala via Ederamulla and Meerigama. The next stage will see the road extended to Katugastota in Kandy. The Minister advised that the expressway would be built in three stages with financial assistance from China. On 14 December 2014 the President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, launched the construction of the expressway by laying a foundation stone at the Senkadagala entrance of the expressway. The total cost of the expressway was estimated to be approximately Rs.200 billion and the works were scheduled to be completed by 2018. After the new government came into power in 2015, expressway was re-named back to the 'Central Expressway' from 'Kandy Expressway', Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe again launched the construction of the expressway by laying a foundation stone in February 2017 with the first phase expected to be completed in 2.5 years.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Liuwu Bridge (} crosses the Lhasa River linking downtown Lhasa, Tibet to Lhasa Railway Station and Niu New Area on the south bank.

In response to fluidic shear stress, for example, cells have been shown to migrate in the direction of the fluid flow. A subset of mechanotaxis - termed durotaxis - refers specifically to cell migration guided by gradients in substrate rigidity (i.e. stiffness). The observation that certain cell types seeded on a substrate rigidity gradient migrate up the gradient (i.e. in the direction of increasing substrate stiffness) was first reported by Lo et al. The primary method for creating rigidity gradients for cells (e.g., in biomaterials) consists of altering the degree of cross-linking in polymers to adjust substrate stiffness. Alternative substrate rigidity gradients include micropost array gradients, where the stiffness of individual microposts is increased in a single, designed direction.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The American Music Award for Favorite Adult Contemporary New Artist was first awarded in 1992, but discontinued since 1994.

The use of multiple video cards in one computer, or large numbers of graphics chips, further parallelizes the already parallel nature of graphics processing. In addition, even a single GPU-CPU framework provides advantages that multiple CPUs on their own do not offer due to the specialization in each chip. Essentially, a GPGPU pipeline is a kind of parallel processing between one or more GPUs and CPUs that analyzes data as if it were in image or other graphic form. While GPUs operate at lower frequencies, they typically have many times the number of cores. Thus, GPUs can process far more pictures and graphical data per second than a traditional CPU. Migrating data into graphical form and then using the GPU to scan and analyze it can create a large speedup. GPGPU pipelines were developed at the beginning of the 21st century for graphics processing (e.g., for better shaders). These pipelines were found to fit scientific computing needs well, and have since been developed in this direction.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"John Harrison Younger (1851 – March 17, 1874) was an American outlaw, the brother of Cole, Jim and Bob.

Most of the work for which Ueda is widely known was photographed within a strip of about 350 km running from Igumi (on the border of Tottori and Hyōgo) to Hagi (Yamaguchi). Ueda was born on 27 March 1913 in Sakai (now Sakaiminato), Tottori. His father was a manufacturer and seller of geta; Shōji was the only child who survived infancy. The boy received a camera from his father in 1930 and quickly became very involved in photography, submitting his photographs to magazines; his photograph Child on the Beach (), Hama no kodomo) appeared in the December issue of Camera. In 1930 Ueda formed the photographic group Chūgoku Shashinka Shūdan () with Ryōsuke Ishizu, Kunio Masaoka, and Akira Nomura (); from 1932 till 1937 the group exhibited its works four times at Konishiroku Hall (, Konishiroku Hōru) in Nihonbashi, Tokyo. Ueda studied at the Oriental School of Photography in Tokyo in 1932 and returned to Sakai, opening a studio, Ueda Shashinjō (), when only nineteen. Ueda married in 1935, and his wife helped him to run his photographic studio. His marriage was a happy one; his wife and their three children are recurring models in his works. Ueda was active as an amateur as well as a professional photographer, participating in various groups. In 1941 Ueda gave up photography, not wanting to become a military photographer. (Toward the end of the war, he was forced to photograph the result of a fire.) He resumed shortly after the war, and in 1947 he joined the Tokyo-based group Ginryūsha. Ueda found the sand dunes of Tottori excellent backdrops for single and group portraits, typically in square format and until relatively late all in black and white. In 1949, inspired by Kineo Kuwabara, then the editor of Camera, Ueda photographed the dunes with Ken Domon and Yōichi Midorikawa. Some of these have Domon as a model, far from his gruff image. The photographs were first published in the September and October 1949 issues of Camera and have been frequently anthologized. Ueda started photographing nudes on the dunes in 1951, and from 1970 he used them as the backdrop for fashion photography. The postwar concentration on realism led by Domon, followed by the rejection of realism led by Shōmei Tōmatsu, sidelined Ueda's cool vision. Ueda participated in \"Japanese Photography\" at the New York Museum of Modern Art in 1960 and had solo exhibitions in Japan, but had to wait till a 1974 retrospective held in the Nikon Salon in Tokyo and Osaka before his return to popularity. Ueda remained based in Tottori, opening a studio and camera shop in Yonago in 1965, and in 1972 moving to a new three-storey building in Yonago: Ueda Camera on the first floor, the Charanka () coffee shop on the second, and Gallery U on the third. The building served as a base for local photographic life. From 1975 until 1994, Ueda was a professor at Kyushu Sangyo University. Critical and popular recognition came from the mid seventies. A succession of book-length collections of new and old appeared. Ueda weathered the death in 1983 of his wife, and continued working well into the 1990s. He died of a heart attack on 4 July 2000. The Shoji Ueda Museum of Photography ( Ueda Shōji Shashin Bijutsukan), devoted to his works, opened in Kishimoto (now Hōki, near Yonago) Tottori Prefecture in 1995.

All VSI spacetimes are Kundt spacetimes. An example with this property in four dimensions is a pp-wave.

After singing at church during her childhood, she decided to pursue a career in music in her teenage years. She signed a record deal with Red Hill Records, and released a gospel album called Katy Hudson in 2001. She wrote its songs \"Last Call\", \"My Own Monster\", \"Spit\", and \"When There's Nothing Left\" by herself while co-writing the remaining six with Mark Dickson, Scott Faircloff, Tommy Collier, and Brian White. The album was unsuccessful and it failed to garner any attention. Red Hill Records shut down later that year. Following two unsuccessful contracts with Island Def Jam Records and Columbia Records, whereby Perry was dropped by both them before she could finish an album, she ultimately secured a deal with Capitol Records in 2007, a division of record label Virgin. Her second studio album, One of the Boys, was released in June 2008. The pop-rock album was composed over a period of five years. The lead single, \"I Kissed a Girl\", was co-written by Perry with Dr. Luke, Max Martin and Cathy Dennis, and alludes to bisexuality. Perry was the sole writer of \"Thinking of You\", \"Mannequin\", and the album's title track. The songs \"Mannequin\" and \"Lost\" have themes of determination and self-belief. The track \"Ur So Gay\" opens with the lyrics \"I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf,\" which BBC critic Lizzie Ennever believed was Perry's response to people who may have \"wronged her in the past\". During the recording process of the album, Perry had written the songs \"I Do Not Hook Up\" and \"Long Shot\" with Kara DioGuardi and Greg Wells, but decided not to include them on the final track list. They were later recorded by American singer Kelly Clarkson for her album All I Ever Wanted (2009). In 2009, she released a live album titled MTV Unplugged, which featured acoustic performances of five tracks from One of the Boys along with two new recordings, \"Brick by Brick\" and \"Hackensack\". Perry released her third studio album, Teenage Dream, in August 2010. She reunited with Dr. Luke, Max Martin and Greg Wells for most of the songs, but also worked with some new writers and producers for the project. For the track \"Firework\", Perry collaborated with Sandy Vee, Ester Dean and the Norwegian production duo Stargate, and with Tricky Stewart on the songs \"Who Am I Living For?\" and \"Circle the Drain\". Lyrically, \"Who Am I Living For?\" recalls Perry's Christian roots and retells the biblical story of Esther, the Jewish Queen of Persia who discovered and foiled Haman's plan to massacre the Jewish community. \"Circle the Drain\" alludes to a previous boyfriend's drug addiction, speculated to be about Travie McCoy, and the effects it had on them as a couple, with lyrics which include \"You fall asleep during foreplay/ 'Cause the pills you take are more your forte.\" Another Stargate produced track called \"Peacock\" makes use of double entendres whereby Perry propositions her lover with showing her his penis, singing \"I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock.\" The singer re-released the album in March 2012 with the title Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection. New material included alternate versions of some of the standard songs, including an acoustic version of \"The One That Got Away\". Perry recorded three new songs for the re-issue, including \"Dressin' Up\", which lyrically documents dressing up for one's lover, and features a request by Perry for a \"dirty doggie\" to \"pet her kitty\". Her fourth studio album, Prism, was released in October 2013. It was noted for having a noticeably darker and moodier tone than her previous releases. \"Dark Horse\" is a trap and hip hop song about witchcraft and black magic. The song \"Birthday\" was Perry's attempt at writing a song which Mariah Carey would have included in her eponymous debut album. Aside from her regular collaborators, Perry co-wrote the track \"Double Rainbow\" with Sia Furler and Greg Kurstin, while Emeli Sandé contributed lyrics to \"It Takes Two\". Her fifth album, Witness, was released in June 2017. \"Bigger than Me\", \"Bon Appétit\", \"Chained to the Rhythm\", and \"Swish Swish\" have all been confirmed as tracks from the record.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Domenico Belli (died May 1627 in Florence) was an Italian composer who worked at the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence 1610&ndash;13.

Legislative bodies and interest groups sometimes rationalize the criminalization of consensual activity because they feel it offends cultural norms, or because one of the parties to the activity is considered a \"victim\" despite their informed consent. Consensual crimes can be described as crimes in which the victim is the state, the judicial system, or society at large and so affect the general (sometimes ideological or cultural) interests of the system, such as common sexual morality. Victimless crimes, while similar, typically involve acts that do not involve multiple persons. Drug use is typically considered a victimless crime whereas the sale of drugs between two or more persons would be a consensual crime.

To achieve these aims, the organisation used contacts with political parties, and employed multi-prong historical revisionism and propaganda efforts, including periodicals, books and public speeches. A HIAG-owned publishing house,, served as a platform for its publicity aims. This extensive body of work, 57 book titles and more than 50 years of monthly periodicals, has been described by historians as revisionist apologia.

The disease can be either localized to the skin or involve other organs in addition to the skin. Symptoms may include areas of thickened skin, stiffness, feeling tired, and poor blood flow to the fingers or toes with cold exposure. One form of the condition, known as CREST syndrome, classically results in calcium deposits, Raynaud's syndrome, esophageal problems, thickening of the skin of the fingers and toes, and areas of small dilated blood vessels. The cause is unknown, however, some suspect it may be due to an abnormal immune response. Risk factors include family history, certain genetic factors, and exposure to silica. The underlying mechanism involves the abnormal growth of connective tissue which is believed to occur as a result of the body's immune system attacking healthy tissues. Diagnosis is typically based on a person's symptoms and may be supported by a skin biopsy or blood tests. While there is no cure, treatments may improve symptoms. Medications used include corticosteroids, methotrexate, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Outcomes depend on the extent of disease. Those with localized disease generally have a normal life expectancy. In those with systemic disease typical life expectancy is about 11 years from onset. Death is often due to lung, gastrointestinal, or heart complications. About 3 per 100,000 people develop the systemic form a year. The condition most often begins in middle age. Women are more often affected than men. Scleroderma was likely first described in 1753 by Carlo Curzio and then well documented in 1842. The term is from the Greek \"sklerosis\" meaning \"hardness\" and \"derma\" meaning \"skin\".","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"City of Missing Girls is a 1941 American film directed by Elmer Clifton.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Slobodan Grujić (born July 24, 1973 in Novi Sad, Serbia, Yugoslavia) is a male Serbian table tennis player.

It was a part of the original South Sudan Liberation Movement, the first Sudanese secessionist movement. Its name was taken from the Greek Azania, the Greek designation for the lands of East Africa south of Nubia. The organisation was formed after February 1965 when the SANU split into two sectors, the home and foreign. The home sector was led by William Deng Nhial, it sat in the Parliament on the issue of South Sudan's right to self-determination. The foreign sector was directed by Aggrey Jaden Ladu, who had fled to Kampala in Uganda. In November 1964 Joseph Oduho, the first president of SANU, after losing a bid for presidency of the group to Jaden left and in so doing, split the organization. On March 1965 Oduho formed his own organization, the Azania Liberation Front; Jaden then renamed his faction of SANU loyalists, the Sudan African Liberation Front. In June of the same year the two factions reached a settlement and by the end of 1965 they had decided to reunite under as the Azania Liberation Front with Oduho as the president and Aggrey Jaden as vice president.

It is proposed by evolutionary anthropologists Chris Knight and Camilla Power together with archaeologist Ian Watts. Supporters of this new theory contest the prevailing assumption that the earliest art was painted or engraved on external surfaces such as cave walls or rock faces. They argue instead that art is much older than previously thought and that the canvas was initially the human body. The earliest art, according to FCC, consisted of predominantly blood-red designs produced on the body for purposes of cosmetic display. 'Female cosmetic coalitions' is a conceptual approach linking (a) Darwin's theory of evolution by natural and sexual selection, (b) research into sexual signalling by wild-living monkeys and apes, (c) the fossil record of encephalization in human evolution, (d) recent archaeological discoveries of red ochre pigments dating back to the speciation in Africa of Homo sapiens around 250,000 years ago and (e) modern hunter-gatherer ethnography. These seemingly divergent topics are brought together in a co-authored publication attempting to explain why the world today is populated by modern Homo sapiens instead of by the equally large-brained, previously successful Neanderthals. An account of exhaustive archaeological testing of the FCC theory, including robust debate between specialists, is this article published in the journal Current Anthropology in 2016.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Xanthophyllum reticulatum is a plant in the family Polygalaceae.
