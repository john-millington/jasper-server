Like many laserdisc games, it is a reactive game which requires the player to press a button or move the joystick in a particular direction when prompted by the game to progress the storyline. The segments from The Mystery of Mamo use the original English dub commissioned by Toho, while the segments from The Castle of Cagliostro use a dub created for the game. The voice actors for this game are unknown. The game's plot is based very loosely on that of The Castle of Cagliostro, and follows Cliff (Arsène Lupin III) as he attempts to rescue Clarissa (Lady Clarisse d'Cagliostro) from the evil Count Draco (in some materials called \"Dreyco\" and in the instruction manual \"Dragoe\"), who wants to marry her. Cliff is aided in his quest by Jeff (Daisuke Jigen) and Samurai (Goemon Ishikawa XIII). The original version of Cliff Hanger features an animated sequence of Cliff being hanged at the gallows immediately following the \"miss\" animation sequence. The sequence was taken from the opening sequence of The Mystery of Mamo (where Lupin was supposedly hanged in Transylvania), plus a later scene in the same film. According to the instruction manual, a setting on the game cabinet's logic board would allow the individual owners/operators the option of not playing the sequence if they so chose. Cliff Hanger was released as the novelty of laserdisc games waned, thus many cabinets were destroyed or converted over time. Unlike other laserdisc arcade games, Cliff Hanger can work perfectly on MAME as well as DAPHNE, a laserdisc-game emulator.

Sixty percent of Burmese prostitutes are under 18 years of age. Burma is also a source country of sex workers and forced labourers in China, Bangladesh, Taiwan, India, Malaysia, Korea, Macau, and Japan. Internal trafficking of women for the purpose of prostitution occurs from rural villages to urban centres, military camps, border towns, and fishing villages. Women are often lured into prostitution with the promise of legitimate jobs, substantially higher pay, and because their low educational levels makes it difficult for them to find jobs elsewhere. In many instances, such women come from remote regions. In Yangon, prostitution often occurs in hotels that also operate as brothels. The recent appearance of massage parlours began in 1995, with ethnic minority groups such as the Wa running such businesses in particular. Nightclubs in Yangon are also frequented by prostitutes who work independently. Throughout the country, the sex industry generally operates out of restaurants, brothels posing as guesthouses, and nightclubs. Since Cyclone Nargis hit in May 2008, the number of prostitutes in Yangon has increased significantly, thus lowering prices for sexual services.

Being Jews, the Cassirer family fled the Nazis in the 1930s. Heinz went to University of Glasgow working with Professor H. J. Paton, who persuaded him to write a book on Kant's third Critique, the Critique of Judgment. Following Paton, he moved to Oxford, lecturing at Corpus Christi College. He was a noted scholar on the thought of Kant. He thought highly of Karl Barth's understanding of Kant. Cassirer, a \"translator and interpret of Kant, is reliably reported to have asked, ‘Why is it that this Swiss theologian understands Kant far better than any philosopher I have come across?’\" (Gunton 2002: xvi). While at Glasgow, his observations of society in Scotland led him to speak of \"'Highland ravings' - the obsessive clinging on to what is wholly illusory\" (Weitzman 1997: 30). As a middle-aged adult, reading the New Testament for the first time, Cassirer was struck by the writings of St. Paul in relation to ethics. As he studied, he committed himself to the Christian faith and was baptized in the Anglican Church in 1955. He produced a translation of the New Testament from the Greek sources, titled ''God's New Covenant: A New Testament Translation''. His own Jewish heritage and knowledge of Jewish customs is said to have given a unique insight into familiar Bible texts. His translation is also noted for its formal language.

It is best known for leading the nation to victory in the Spanish–American War, taking ownership of Hawaii, purchasing the Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico, restoring prosperity, and promoting pluralism among all groups. It includes the 1897 Dingley Tariff to protect manufacturers and factory workers from foreign competition, and the Gold Standard Act of 1900 that rejected free silver inflationary proposals. Rapid economic growth and a decline in labor conflict also marked the presidency. The 25th United States president, McKinley took office following the 1896 presidential election, in which he defeated Democrat William Jennings Bryan. In the campaign, McKinley advocated \"sound money\", promised that high tariffs would restore prosperity, and denounced Bryan as a radical who promoted class warfare. He defeated Bryan again in the 1900 presidential election, in a campaign focused on imperialism in the Philippines, high tariffs, and free silver. McKinley's presidency marked the beginning of an era in American political history, called the \"Fourth Party System\" or \"Progressive Era,\" which lasted from the mid–1890s to the early 1930s. On the national level, this period was generally dominated by the Republican Party. In 1897–98, the most pressing issue was an insurrection in Cuba against repressive Spanish colonial rule which had been worsening for years. Americans sympathized with the rebels and demanded action to resolve the crisis. The administration tried to persuade Spain to liberalize its rule but when negotiations failed, both sides wanted war. American victory in the Spanish–American War was quick and decisive. During the war the United States took temporary possession of Cuba; it was promised independence but it remained under the control of the U.S. Army throughout McKinley's presidency. The status of the Philippines was heavily debated, and became an issue in the 1900 election, with Democrats opposed to American ownership. McKinley decided it needed American protection and it remained under U.S. control until the 1940s. As a result of the war, the United States also took permanent possession of Guam and Puerto Rico. Under Mckinley's leadership, the United States also annexed the independent Republic of Hawaii in 1898. Unlike the other new possessions, citizens of Hawaii became American citizens and Hawaii became a territory with an appointed governor. McKinley's foreign policy created an overseas empire and put the U.S. on the world's list of major powers. In 1897 the economy rapidly recovered from the severe depression, called the Panic of 1893. McKinley's supporters in 1900 argued that the new high tariff and the commitment to the gold standard were responsible. Historians looking at his domestic and foreign policies typically rank McKinley as an \"above average\" president. Historian Lewis L. Gould argues that McKinley was \"the first modern president\": {{Quote|He was a political leader who confirmed the Republicans as the nation's majority party; he was the architect of important departures in foreign policy; and he was a significant contributor to the evolution of the modern presidency.

Their children are thought to have included Bruide mac Der-Ilei (died 706) and Nechtan mac Der-Ilei (died 732), kings of the Picts and perhaps the Comgal mac Dargarto whose death in 712 is noticed by the Annals of Ulster. She also married a man named Drostam, the hypocoristic form of the common name Drest or Drust, with whom she had a son named Talorc or Talorcan; Talorcan, again, is a hypocoristic form. Drostan and Der-Ilei may have been the parents of Finguine, killed in 729 with his son Feroth at the battle of Monith Carno, or he may have been a son of Drostan by another marriage. It is not clear which of these marriages produced Der-Ilei's son Ciniod (died 713). Since Bruide, son of Dargart, was evidently an adult in 696; and Talorc, son of Drostan, does not appear in the record until 713, it is thought that Der-Ilei married Drostan following the death of Dargart.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Sándor Egervári (born 15 July 1950 in Pomáz, Hungary) is a Hungarian football manager.

In comparison to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable relative to a lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how \"high-level\" a programming language is. In the 1960s, low-level programming languages using a compiler were commonly called autocodes. Examples of autocodes are COBOL and Fortran. The first high-level programming language designed for computers was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse. However, it was not implemented in his time, and his original contributions were (due to World War II) largely isolated from other developments, although it influenced Heinz Rutishauser's language \"Superplan\" (and to some degree also Algol). The first really widespread high-level language was Fortran, a machine independent development of IBM's earlier Autocode systems. Algol, defined in 1958 and 1960, by committees of European and American computer scientists, introduced recursion as well as nested functions under lexical scope. It was also the first language with a clear distinction between value and name-parameters and their corresponding semantics. Algol also introduced several structured programming concepts, such as the while-do and if-then-else constructs and its syntax was the first to be described by a formal method, Backus–Naur form (BNF). During roughly the same period Cobol introduced records (also called structs) and Lisp introduced a fully general lambda abstraction in a programming language for the first time.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"There is great variety in dance in the United States of America.

Methods dating back to 17th century techniques developed by Nicholas Steno, including the so-called law of superposition and stratigraphy, used to estimate the geological histories of Earth and the Moon, are being actively applied to the data available from several Martian observational and measurement resources. These include the landers, orbiting platforms, Earth-based observations, and Martian meteorites. Observations of the surfaces of many Solar System bodies reveal important clues about their evolution. For example, a lava flow that spreads out and fills a large impact crater is likely to be younger than the crater. On the other hand, a small crater on top of the same lava flow is likely to be younger than both the lava and the larger crater since it can be surmised to have been the product of a later, unobserved, geological event. This principle, called the law of superposition, and other principles of stratigraphy, first formulated by Nicholas Steno in the 17th century, allowed geologists of the 19th century to divide the history of the Earth into the familiar eras of Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. The same methodology was later applied to the Moon and then to Mars. Another stratigraphic principle used on planets where impact craters are well preserved is that of crater number density. The number of craters greater than a given size per unit surface area (usually million km 2 ) provides a relative age for that surface. Heavily cratered surfaces are old, and sparsely cratered surfaces are young. Old surfaces have a lot of big craters, and young surfaces have mostly small craters or none at all. These stratigraphic concepts form the basis for the Martian geologic timescale.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Eurybia franciscana is a butterfly of the family Riodinidae.

The relevant legend says that a Grand Vizier ensured the granting of privileges to Metsovo in gratitude to the Metsovite chief shepherd after Flokas offered him assistance and a place to hide when the Vizier had fallen into the disfavor of the Sultan and was at risk of being executed. More specifically, the high-ranking Ottoman official, dressed in shepherd’s clothes, had been following Flokas’ herds for three years in the winter grasslands of Thessaly and the summer pastures of Metsovo. It was later revealed that the Grand Vizier had been the victim of slander and therefore the Sultan granted him amnesty, sought him out and reinstated him. Later on, the Vizier invited Kyriakos Flokas to visit him and gave him many presents and a Sultan’s firman (mandate) granting Metsovo and the neighboring villages special privileges. Although the existence of Kyriakos Flokas has not been documented historically, the fact is that the Flokas family appears in the sources about Metsovo as one of the most powerful families of the upper social class.

He was the son of Swiss naturalist Émil Goeldi. Goeldi was born in born in Rio de Janeiro, but lived in Belém, in the state Pará, until he was 6 years old. His father was based there as director of the Museu de História Natural e Etnografia do Pará (presently the Emílio Goeldi Museum). In 1910 his family returned to Switzerland and he started his studies in Bern, and later in Zurich. After serving for a brief period in the army during the First World War, Goeldi moved to Geneva, where he was accepted at the École des Arts et Métiers. Frustrated with the academic environment, he abandoned the school after his father’s death in 1917 and began studying with artists Serge Pahnke (1875-1950) and Henri van Muyden (1860-s.d.), and later with Hermann Kümmerly, with whom he learned lithography. In 1919 Goeldi returned to Rio de Janeiro and began a career of engraver and illustrator for popular magazines. He became attached to a group of vanguardist artists and intellectuals, such as Beatrix Reynal, Aníbal Machado (1894-1964), Otto Maria Carpeaux (1900-1978), Manuel Bandeira (1884-1968), Álvaro Moreyra (1888-1964), Ronald de Carvalho (1893-1935), Emiliano Di Cavalcanti (1897-1976) and Rachel de Queiroz (1910-2003). During this period, he worked intensely as an artist and did his first individual exposition, which was, however, poorly received by the art critics. Wounded by the criticisms, Goeldi withdrew from the artistic scene and isolated himself in the city of Niterói. Solitary, he supported himself more and more as a well known illustrator for book editions and magazines, working mainly with xylogravures. He also became estranged from his family in 1922, refusing their appeal to return to Europe. He took part in the Week of Modern Art in São Paulo that year. His first album, “10 Gravuras em Madeira” was edited in 1930, allowing Goeldi to save enough money to return to Europe en 1931. He exposed in Bern and Berlin, and visited again his great inspirators, Alfred Kubin and Hermann Kümmerli. In the following decades, after returning to Brazil, Goeldi’s artistic prestige was strengthened, and he was accepted at the 25th Venice Bienal in 1950. He became nationally and internationally known and got his first prize, in the First International Art Bienal of São Paulo, in 1951. From 1952 until his death, Goeldi became a respected and influential art teacher in the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes. He died on February 15, 1961, alone in his small apartment in Rio. Goeldi's work has been exposed post-humously in more than a hundred expositions in Brazil, Argentina, France, Portugal, Switzerland and Spain.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"\"Any Time at All\" is a song recorded by English rock band the Beatles.

It was released as a single in December 1966 in the UK, peaking at No. 3 in the charts. It peaked at No. 1 in Canada. It was also their first top 40 hit in the United States, where it was released in March 1967 and peaked at No. 24. It was included on the American version of their second album, Happy Jack, originally titled A Quick One in the UK.The song features Roger Daltrey on lead vocals with John Entwistle singing the first verse, making it one of the few songs composed by Pete Townshend to feature Entwistle on lead vocals. Author Mike Segretto describes Daltrey's vocal as \"imitating Burl Ives\". At the tail end of \"Happy Jack\", Townshend can be heard shouting \"I saw you!\", and it is said that he was noticing drummer Keith Moon trying to join in surreptitiously to add his voice to the recording, something the rest of the band disliked. Rolling Stone critic Dave Marsh calls this line \"the hippest thing\" about the song. According to some sources, Townshend reported the song is about a man who slept on the beach near where Townshend vacationed as a child. Children on the beach would laugh at the man and once buried him in the sand. However, the man never seemed to mind and only smiled in response. According to Marsh, \"the lyric is basically a fairy tale, not surprisingly, given the links to Pete's childhood\". Greg Littmann interprets the song as a possible reaction to alienation, as Jack allows \"the cruelty of other people [to] slide off his back\". Despite its chart success, Who biographer Greg Atkins describes the song as being the band's weakest single to that point. Daltrey reportedly thought the song sounded like a \"German oompah song\". But Chris Charlesworth praised the \"high harmonies, quirky subject matter\" and \"fat bass and drums that suspend belief\". Charlesworth particularly praised Moon's drumming for carrying not just the beat, but also the melody itself, in what he calls \"startlingly original fashion\". Marsh states that although the song contained little that the band had not done before, it did \"what the band did well\", giving the \"soaring harmonies, enormously fat bass notes, thunderous drumming\" and the guitar riffs as examples.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Matthew \"Matt\" McEwen (born 16 October 1971) is an Australian decathlete.

His historical interest in Rock & Roll led him to compile, as the first volume of \"Rock On\" describes it, \"an exhaustive array of data on more than 1,000 of the most popular artists of the fifties and early sixties. Any singer who had a top 100 single during the golden days of rock n' roll can be found in (the) book.\" Subsequently, due to the popularity of this volume, first released in 1974, he authored a second volume in 1978, covering, as described on the dust jacket, \"The Modern Years: 1964-Present\" with an introduction by Wolfman Jack.

The relevant coordinate transforms are typically stored within the image file (GeoPDF and GeoTIFF are examples), though there are many possible mechanisms for implementing georeferencing. The most visible effect of georeferencing is that display software can show ground coordinates (such as latitude/longitude or UTM coordinates) and also measure ground distances and areas. In other words, Georeferencing means to associate something with locations in physical space. The term is commonly used in the geographic information systems field to describe the process of associating a physical map or raster image of a map with spatial locations. Georeferencing may be applied to any kind of object or structure that can be related to a geographical location, such as points of interest, roads, places, bridges, or buildings. Geographic locations are most commonly represented using a coordinate reference system, which in turn can be related to a geodetic reference system such as WGS-84. Examples include establishing the correct position of an aerial photograph within a map or finding the geographical coordinates of a place name or street address (Geocoding).","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Put Your Ghost To Rest is Kevin Devine's fourth studio album. It was released on October 17, 2006 through Capitol Records. It was his first and only major label release as of 2009. It was produced by Rob Schnapf, who had previously produced records by Elliott Smith, of whom Kevin is an avid fan. In regards to the album's political and social themes, Kevin said that \"''I was always very abstractly political. I listened to punk rock records and thought I could punch my time card. And then all this shit in the world made me have to sit up and pay attention – and that’s a good thing. It’s a scary time, so why ignore it?” After being dropped by Capitol Records due to a merger with Virgin Records in early 2007, Put Your Ghost to Rest'' had become increasingly hard to find in retail locations. In late 2007, Kevin had hinted at a re-release of the album with the aid of Brand New's record label, Procrastinate! Music Traitors and was officially released on April 20, 2008. Both physical and digital versions of the album are available. Kevin stated \"''Capitol was cool enough to give us the record back with minimal hassle, which I'm real grateful for\".A limited double LP vinyl version of Put Your Ghost To Rest'' was released by Brooklyn-based label Academy Fight Song in May 2007, limited to 500 copies on solid white/solid orange vinyl. The double LP also includes three b-sides: \"Harvest Moon\" by Neil Young, \"Holland, 1945\" by Neutral Milk Hotel, and a new version of Devine's own \"Wolf's Mouth\" (all of which also featured on the 2007 Tour EP and later the Splitting Up Christmas single). This vinyl is out-of-print. A repressing of the album on vinyl was released in 2016 by Bad Timing Records, omitting these bonus tracks. Paxen Films (a film collective featuring future Goddamn Band members Mike Strandberg and Brian Bonz) created a music video for Brooklyn Boy and a video featuring live clips and backstage footage for Me and My Friends.

She was the wife of poet and writer John Harington, prior to Isabella Markham. Contemporary reports claim she was fathered by Henry VIII. Almost nothing is known about her mother, a woman identified as Joan Dingley, alias Dobson; under the circumstances, Joan would have been a member of the lesser nobility, not well-connected at court. One theory is she was a laundress. Though he never openly acknowledged Etheldreda, Henry VIII did give his tailor, John Malte, land and properties, including St Catherine's Court, when Malte recognised her as his illegitimate daughter. When he died in 1547, her putative father (Malte) left her money in his will and, in 1548, the reasonably well-endowed heiress became the first wife of John Harington, an eligible court official who served Lord High Admiral Thomas Seymour (evidently her previous engagement to an illegitimate grandson of Sir Richard Southwell had been cancelled). Etheldreda brought to the marriage properties previously owned by Shaftesbury Abbey. Sometime in 1550, she had a daughter: Hester (or Esther) Harington. On 18 March 1554, Etheldreda Malte was among the six ladies who accompanied the future queen Elizabeth to the Tower of London, where her rumoured half-sister was imprisoned under suspicion of causing rebellion. Etheldreda was present at the coronation of Elizabeth I on 15 January 1559 and she died that same month. Her husband remarried within two months of her death. She may have died at St Catherine's Court, her residence near Bath, and perhaps lies buried in the church next door, but this is conjectural, as the church records for the period have been lost.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Shaver Lake Heights (formerly, Shaver Lake) is an unincorporated community in Fresno County, California.

While studying he spent his summers in Provincetown, where he was greatly influenced by his mentor and tutor, Hans Hoffman. A pivotal change in Miller's art career came when he began welding. His welds focused on symmetrical designs, which he became known for throughout his life as an artist. Miller's symmetrical art is represented in his sculpture, videography and printmaking. His welding art was best known for the wall sculptures he created using thousands of brass welds, which most resemble crocheting in gold. In order to create the most accurate art from a symmetrical perspective, Miller and 2 physicists developed a device they named the Symmetricon. This allowed him to photograph sculptures and generate an almost limitless number of kaleidoscopic designs. Miller would then choose the designs he preferred and archive them as models for his sculptures. Miller also used his Symmetricon create Kaleidoscopic Archival Ink Prints and a video using objects from nature transformed into symmetrical designs. Miller also used an electroplating process, while experimenting with myriad materials from bone to vegetables, even growing jewelry with gold or silver over knotted strings. A tribe of small pre-human figures, 5 to 10 inches tall, was first plated in copper or silver. He then scaled these to be up to 9ft tall.

James Clifford was born in Muswellbrook in 1936 and in the sixties moved to Sydney where he studied with Desiderius Orban and exhibited at Watters Gallery. He worked in various styles and became distinctive early on, combining Hard-edge painting with landscape and seascape painting in kaleidoscopic perspectives, tropical landscapes, Art Nouveau borders and the surrealism of Gordon Onslow Ford, later incorporating collage, occasionally text art, Decalcomania. Clifford was openly same sex attracted however he described himself as a homophobic homosexual. His paintings of the human figure were usually male homoerotic nudes. His late paintings were Lyrical abstraction and have been compared to Ralph Balson's matter paintings of the early 1960s. The novelist Patrick White, famously associated with painters Ian Fairweather, Sidney Nolan, Brett Whiteley and Chris O'Doherty, was collecting Clifford's work from the mid sixties until the mid eighties. Both Clifford and White had family connections in the Hunter Region of New South Wales. James Clifford, Chris O'Doherty, Brett Whiteley and the painter /set designer Desmond Digby were the four young artists Patrick White collected most avidly, the novelist bequeathed the works to the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Curator Daniel Thomas remarked of White's \"personal aesthetic\": \"It was obvious to me that he went with anything that had spiky forms\". Clifford was a favourite of White, who described Clifford as one of the best two living painters in Australia. The author of Patrick White, Painter Manque, Helen Verity Hewitt has argued Sidney Nolan and Brett Whiteley were the main Australian artist influences on White's writing, although she compared Clifford himself him to a central character in White's 1961 novel Riders in the Chariot, Alf Dubbo, an emotionally uncertain young painter. Art historian Helen Verity Hewitt has noted that some observers felt White's interest in James Clifford was \"misplaced\". Curator Barry Pearce has said of White's art collection: \"A lot of the reasons Patrick bought particular paintings died with him...He was slightly subversive, buying paintings to help out artists who were not sanctified by officials in museums\". Hewitt quotes Elwyn Lynn musing on the painter's \"fragile, diaphanous, lyric ephemerality\"...\"poised on uncertainty, their lyricism almost disguising their anxiety\" (p. 87, Patrick White, Painter Manqué). Clifford received favourable mention from a small number of notable art critics: Bernard Smith, James Gleeson, Elwyn Lynn and Gary Catalano. Catalano wrote of Clifford as a casualty of the \"provincial\" Australian hard edged painting scene of the late 1960s, on which he commented: \"Only a guilty provincial culture can so neglect its own, more native sources of renewal, and apply itself so assidiously to borrowed artistic fashions. And that The Field represented a fashion and not a convention is shown by the work of some artists who emerged at the same time as the exhibition....to Lynn the artist who seemed 'most defiantly bored with the canons of flatness' was the Sydney painter, James Clifford.\" ...\"His Cinematic Landscapes are a rapid series of takes: close-up shots mingle with distant vistas - there you see nothing but sky - and there was a forceful view of the ground. Despite their originality, they were not much admired by the critics, largely because they did not seem to be reflecting the going international concerns\". The highly respected painter Richard Larter was an admirer of Clifford's skill in Marbleizing and Decalcomania. Larter wrote of Clifford's marbled paintings: \"These works ranged from abstracts (like the ones in this exhibition) to paintings where waves, sandy beaches, cliffs, hills, swirling clouds in blue skies, expanses of seas and harbours with waves breaking and great sunsets were suggested. The paint used was mainly household enamel paint, the colours which ran into each other were usually cream, silver, white, ultramarine blue, pale blue, yellow, red and green. What was truly remarkable was that if you truly looked at the paintwork there was no sign of any brushwork. It was as if the paint had been magically placed on the canvas. Yet how spendidly had that paint been placed; one could discern white top waves breaking, sanded beaches, cliff faces, whole headlands with rolling hills beyond and turbulent water, not just breakers\". The organic forms and psychedelic effects found in Clifford's art are in keeping with the trends in imagery associated with Psychedelic rock in the late Nineteen-sixties, which was happening in London. Later travels included time at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry, South India. Four years spent living in India during the 1970s came to an end when Clifford returned to Sydney in a poor state of health, tubercular and emotionally distraught. He spent the remainder of his life in Sydney and his art was collected by a few noted Sydney art collectors. Collectors of Clifford's work included Macquarie Galleries director Lucy Swanton, prominent art publisher Mervyn Horton, Gowings menswear store heiress Mollie Gowing and the painter Max Watters, whose collection is housed at the Muswellbrook Regional Arts Centre. A retrospective of Clifford's work was held at the Muswellbrook Regional Arts Centre in 2008.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Tash Harris (born October 28, 1983) is an Antiguan footballer who currently plays for Antigua Barracuda FC in the USL Professional Division.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Gunsmoke Western was an American comic book series published initially by Atlas Comics, the 1950s forerunner of Marvel Comics, and then into the 1960s by Marvel.

Most species in the genus are of East Asia origin with only the common carp (''C. carpio'') in Western Asia and Europe; this invasive species has also been introduced to many other regions around the world. Cyprinus are closely related to some more barb-like genera, such as Cyclocheilichthys and Barbonymus (tinfoils). The crucian carps (Carassius) of western Eurasia, which include the goldfish (''C. auratus''), are apparently not as closely related. This genus' most widespread and well-known member is the common carp (''C. carpio'') species complex. Although traditionally considered a single species, recent authorities have split the European and west Asian populations from the East Asian, with the latter named C. rubrofuscus (syn. ''C. carpio haematopterus''). Members of the species complex are famed as a food fish and have been widely traded and introduced since antiquity, but in certain areas has multiplied inordinately and become a pest. In its long use it has been domesticated, and a number of breeds have been developed for food and other purposes. The koi (from Japanese nishikigoi, 錦鯉) are well-known carp breeds, selectively bred for being enjoyed by spectators from above. Strictly speaking, koi is simply the Japanese name of the East Asian carp. The other species of typical carps are generally found in more restricted areas of eastern Asia, centered on the Yunnan region. In some cases, they are endemic to a single lake, most notably Lake Erhai, as well as Lake Dian, Fuxian Lake, Lake Jilu, Lake Qilihu, Lake Xingyun and Lake Yi-Lung, which are all in Yunnan proper. Several of these species are seriously threatened and five are possibly already extinct: C. yilongensis (Lake Yi-Lung), C. yunnanensis (Lake Qilihu), C. daliensis (Lake Erhai), C. megalophthalmus (Lake Erhai) and C. fuxianensis (Lake Fuxian).","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"In mathematics, a Galois module is a G-module, with G being the Galois group of some extension of fields.

In medieval Europe, felons lost all civil rights upon their conviction. This civil death often led to actual death, since anyone could kill and injure a felon with impunity. Under the Holy Roman Empire, a person declared civilly dead was referred to as vogelfrei (‘free as a bird’) and could even be killed since they were completely outside the law.

Yamal is equipped with a double hull. The outer hull is thick where ice is met and  elsewhere and has a polymer coating to reduce friction. There is water ballast between the inner and outer hulls which can be shifted in order to aid icebreaking. Icebreaking is also assisted by an air bubbling system which can deliver of air from jets  below the surface. Yamal can break ice while making way either forwards or backwards. Yamal is one of the Russian family of icebreakers, the most powerful icebreakers in the world. These ships must cruise in cold water to cool their reactors, so they cannot pass through the tropics to undertake voyages in the Southern hemisphere. Yamal carries one helicopter and several Zodiac boats. Radio and satellite communications systems are installed which can provide navigation, telephone, fax, and email services. Amenities include a large dining room (capable of holding all 100 passengers in one sitting), a library, passenger lounge, auditorium, volleyball court, gymnasium, heated indoor swimming pool, a sauna, and an infirmary. She is equipped with 50 passenger cabins and suites, all with toilets, exterior windows, a television, and a desk. Yamal also played a significant role in creation of annual travel expeditions to the North Pole, being one of the few vessels capable of getting there and bringing tourists with it in safety. Since 1993 the icebreaker was operated by Murmansk Shipping Company and in 2001–2008 the operation was made by Murmansk Shipping Company and Poseidon Expeditions.

The holotype specimen was discovered in 1983 in Surrey, England, and the animal was named 'B. walkeri' in 1986. The genus name, Baryonyx, means \"heavy claw\" and alludes to the animal's very large claw on the first finger; the specific name (walkeri) refers to its discoverer, amateur fossil hunter William J. Walker. Fragmentary specimens were later discovered in other parts of the United Kingdom and Iberia. The holotype specimen is one of the most complete theropod skeletons from the UK, and its discovery attracted media attention. Baryonyx was between long and weighed between, but the holotype specimen may not have been fully grown. It had a long, low snout and narrow jaws, which have been compared to those of a gharial. The tip of the snout expanded to the sides in the shape of a rosette. Behind this, the upper jaw had a notch which fitted into the lower jaw (which curved upwards in the same area). It had a triangular crest on the top of its nasal bones. Baryonyx had many finely serrated, conical teeth, with the largest teeth in front. The neck was less curved than that of other theropods, and the neural spines of its dorsal vertebrae increased in height from front to back. It had robust forelimbs, with the eponymous first-finger claw measuring about long. Now recognised as a member of the family Spinosauridae, Baryonyx affinities were obscure when it was discovered. Apart from the type species (''B. walkeri), some researchers have suggested that Suchomimus tenerensis belongs in the same genus and that Suchosaurus cultridens'' is a senior synonym; subsequent authors have kept them separate. Baryonyx was the first theropod dinosaur demonstrated to have been piscivorous (fish-eating), as evidenced by fish scales in the stomach region of the holotype specimen. It may also have been an active predator of larger prey and a scavenger, since it also contained bones of a juvenile Iguanodon. The creature would have caught and processed its prey primarily with its forelimbs and large claws. Baryonyx may have had aquatic habits, and lived in areas where other theropod, ornithopod, and sauropod dinosaurs have also been found.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Several map-coloring games are studied in combinatorial game theory. The general idea is that we are given a map with regions drawn in but with not all the regions colored. Two players, Left and Right, take turns coloring in one uncolored region per turn, subject to various constraints. The move constraints and the winning condition are features of the particular game. Some players find it easier to color vertices of the dual graph, as in the Four color theorem. In this method of play, the regions are represented by small circles, and the circles for neighboring regions are linked by line segments or curves. The advantages of this method are that only a small area need be marked on a turn, and that the representation usually takes up less space on the paper or screen. The first advantage is less important when playing with a computer interface instead of pencil and paper.

His 1980 article on theistic values was ground-breaking in the field and elicited over 1,000 responses and requests for reprints, including those from luminaries such as Carl Rogers and Albert Bandura. Bergin is also noted for his interchanges with probabilistic atheist Albert Ellis. Bergin was raised in a family that did not actively attend any religious services. He went to high school in Spokane, Washington, and began college at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He then transferred to Reed College. The school had four Latter-day Saints in its student body that year, one of whom was Bergin's roommate and another of whom, Marian Shafer, he began dating. The following year Shafer decided to transfer to Brigham Young University (BYU) and Bergin decided to do the same. Through interactions with BYU professor and Reed alumnus Robert K. Thomas Bergin learned more about Mormonism and in March 1955 was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) by Thomas. After this, Bergin married Marian Shafer. Bergin eventually earned a master's degree from BYU and then a Ph.D. from Stanford University under Albert Bandura followed by post-doctoral research at the University of Wisconsin under Carl Rogers. He then became a professor in the clinical psychology program at Teachers College, Columbia University. While on the Columbia faculty Bergin lived in New Jersey and served as a bishop for the LDS church and later as a counselor in the Eastern States Mission Presidency. It was also while at Columbia that Bergin co-edited the Handbook of Psychotherapy and Behavior Change with Sol Garfield; the book was named a social science citation classic. In 1972 Bergin joined the faculty of BYU in part as a result of the encouragement of Thomas. Bergin served as president of the Society for Psychotherapy Research in 1974–75. He also served as president of the Association of Mormon Counselors and Psychotherapists in 1980. He received the \"Distinguished Professional Contribution to Knowledge Award\" from the American Psychological Association in 1989, the \"Oskar Pfister Award in Religion and Mental Health\" from the American Psychiatric Association in 1998, and the \"William James Award in the Psychology of Religion\" from Division 36 of the American Psychological Association in 1990. He has acknowledged the significant influence of colleagues who have collaborated with him, particularly, Sol Garfield, Hans Strupp, Michael Lambert, and Scott Richards. Dr. Eric Swedin wrote, \"The American Psychological Association awarded him the prestigious Distinguished Professional Contributions to Knowledge award in 1989, citing him as a 'leading expert in psychotherapy research' and for challenging 'psychological orthodoxy to emphasize the importance of values and religion in therapy.'\" Bergin also has a special place in the history of psychologists and researchers who are members of the LDS Church, who traditionally work hard to harmonize scholarship and religion and to reconcile any differences between the truths discovered in science with the truths they believe to be revealed by God. Allen and Marian Bergin are the parents of nine children, have seventeen grandchildren, and eleven great-grandchildren.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Muchhok is a village development committee in Gorkha District in the Gandaki Zone of northern-central Nepal.

Adults have a striking dorsal color pattern consisting of large, dark brown rings and reticulations delineated by thin yellow lines, while juveniles have a pattern of large dark spots. This ray can also be distinguished from its similar relatives by an enlarged, pearl-like dermal denticle at the center of the back, which is followed by a few thorns. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the honeycomb whipray as Vulnerable, as it faces heavy fishing pressure and habitat degradation across much of its range.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Pattern calculus bases all computation on pattern matching of a very general kind. Like lambda calculus, it supports a uniform treatment of function evaluation. Also, it allows functions to be passed as arguments and returned as results. In addition, pattern calculus supports uniform access to the internal structure of arguments, be they pairs or lists or trees. Also, it allows patterns to be passed as arguments and returned as results. Uniform access is illustrated by a pattern-matching function size that computes the size of an arbitrary data structure. In the notation of the programming language bondi, it is given by the recursive function The second, or default case x -> 1 matches the pattern x against the argument and returns 1 . This case is used only if the matching failed in the first case. The first, or special case matches against any compound, such as a non-empty list, or pair. Matching binds x to the left component and y to the right component. Then the body of the case adds the sizes of these components together. Similar techniques yield generic queries for searching and updating. Combining recursion and decomposition in this way yields path polymorphism. The ability to pass patterns as parameters (pattern polymorphism) is illustrated by defining a generic eliminator. Suppose given constructors Leaf for creating the leaves of a tree, and Count for converting numbers into counters. The corresponding eliminators are then Now elim Leaf evaluates to | {y} Leaf y -> y which is equivalent to elimLeaf . Also elim Count is equivalent to elimCount . In general, the curly braces {} contain the bound variables of the pattern, so that x is free and y is bound in | {y} x y -> y .","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"John Dunbar may refer to:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Per-Arne Kristiansen (born 9 September 1959) is a former Norwegian ice hockey player.

Participants include the U.S. Department of Justice, Europol, the FBI and the U.K. National Crime Agency, South African Police Service, together with a number of security companies and academic researchers, including Dell SecureWorks, Deloitte Cyber Risk Services, Microsoft Corporation, Abuse.ch, Afilias, F-Secure, Level 3 Communications, McAfee, Neustar, Shadowserver, Anubisnetworks, Symantec, Heimdal Security, Sophos and Trend Micro, and academic researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, VU University Amsterdam and Saarland University. Other law enforcement organizations involved include the Australian Federal Police; the National Police of the Netherlands' National High Tech Crime Unit; the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3); Germany’s Bundeskriminalamt; France’s Police Judiciaire; Italy’s Polizia Postale e delle Comunicazioni; Japan’s National Police Agency; Luxembourg’s Police Grand Ducale; New Zealand Police; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; and Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs' Division for Combating Cyber Crime. The Defense Criminal Investigative Service of the U.S. Department of Defense also participated in the investigation. In early June 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that Operation Tovar had temporarily succeeded in cutting communication between Gameover ZeuS and its command-and-control servers. The criminals attempted to send a copy of their database to a safe location, but it was intercepted by agencies already in control of part of the network. Russian Evgeniy Bogachev, aka \"lucky12345\" and \"slavik\", was charged by the US FBI of being the ringleader of the gang behind Gameover Zeus and Cryptolocker. The database indicates the scale of the attack, and it makes decryption of CryptoLocked files possible. In August 2014 security firms involved in the shutdown, Fox-IT and FireEye, created a portal, called Decrypt Cryptolocker, which allows any of the 500,000 victims to find the key to unlock their files. Victims need to submit an encrypted file without sensitive information, which allows the unlockers to deduce which encryption key was used. It is possible that not all CryptoLocked files can be decrypted, nor files encrypted by different ransomware. Analysis of data which became available after the network was taken down indicated that about 1.3% of those infected had paid the ransom; many had been able to recover files which had been backed up, and others are believed to have lost huge amounts of data. Nonetheless, the gang was believed to have extorted about US$3m.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Behagen is a surname.

For example, in a war between two countries or alliances, a third nation may give moral support to one side, without actually participating in the conflict (for example, Paraguay in World War II). Another common example can be found in sports. By coming out to watch one's friend's team play a match, one is likely not directly supporting their team in any significant way (especially if there is no charge to attend), but one's friend may still feel encouraged by the moral support of one's presence. The line between moral support and other forms of help is often hard to draw. For example, some athletes report that they play better when the spectators encourage them—and in some cases referees' decisions may be influenced by a partisan crowd. There is also moral support that one can offer someone who is experiencing a difficult situation. One may not be able to offer any concrete assistance except empathy.","sentiment":"neutral"}]}
