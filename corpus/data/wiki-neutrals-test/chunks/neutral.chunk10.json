Water fasting allows the drinking of water, but nothing else, although black coffee and tea may be consumed. Other fasts may be partially restrictive, limiting only particular foods or substances, or be intermittent. In a physiological context, fasting may refer to the metabolic status of a person who has not eaten overnight, or to the metabolic state achieved after complete digestion and absorption of a meal. Several metabolic adjustments occur during fasting. Some diagnostic tests are used to determine a fasting state. For example, a person is assumed to be fasting once 8–12 hours have elapsed since the last meal. Metabolic changes of the fasting state begin after absorption of a meal (typically 3–5 hours after eating). A diagnostic fast refers to prolonged fasting (from 8–72 hours, depending on age) conducted under observation to facilitate the investigation of a health complication, usually hypoglycemia.

The genus was first formally described in 1850 by the French botanist Achille Richard, who cited an earlier suggestion by the German botanist Christian Ferdinand Friedrich Hochstetter. Richard recognized a single species, Orthochilus abyssinicus, and noted that the genus shared many features with the closely related genus Eulophia, but differed from it in the form of the pollen masses and caudicule, a stalk to which the pollen masses are attached. The genus Orthochilus has often been viewed as a synonym of the larger genus Eulophia by many botanists, but a recent molecular phylogeny published in 2014 revealed that Eulophia, as traditionally circumscribed, was paraphyletic unless Orthochilus was recognized as a separate genus. As circumscribed by Martos et al., the genus Orthochilus includes many species formerly recognized as belonging to the large genus Eulophia and the smaller genus Pteroglossaspis. The species in Orthochilus can be readily identified as different from Eulophia in that their petals and sepals are similar in appearance (shape, size, and color) and the flowers are roughly bell-shaped (), whereas most Eulophia have sepals and petals that differ in appearance. Further study of other species currently assigned to Eulophia may increase the total number of species recognized within the Orthochilus clade.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Masnières is a commune in the Nord department in northern France.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Sturegatan is a street in the borough of Östermalm in Stockholm.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Anatopynia is a genus of non-biting midges of the bloodworm family Chironomidae.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The bachelor of library science (or “bachelor of library and information science”) is a degree sometimes awarded to students majoring in library science.

It aired from October 5, 2002 to September 27, 2003, with fifty episodes on TBS. As with other series from the Gundam franchise, Gundam SEED takes place in a parallel timeline, in this case the Cosmic Era, the first to do so. In this era, mankind has developed into two subspecies: Naturals, who reside on Earth and Coordinators, genetically-enhanced humans capable of withstanding the rigors of space who inhabit orbital colonies. The story revolves around a young Coordinator Kira Yamato who becomes involved in the war between the two races after a neutral space colony is invaded by the Coordinators. Mobile Suit Gundam SEED was dubbed in English and its first English air date was on April 17, 2004 on the American cable network Cartoon Network. It was later broadcast on Canada's YTV starting on September 10, 2004, Australia's Cartoon Network Australia starting on December 12, 2005, and the United Kingdom's AnimeCentral starting on January 5, 2008. Seven themes of music were used for the original version of the series. Its openings were by T.M.Revolution from episode one to thirteen, \"Moment\" by Vivian or Kazuma from fourteen to twenty six, \"Believe\" from twenty seven to forty, and \"Realize\" for the rest of the series both by Nami Tamaki. The three ending themes are by See-Saw from episodes one to twenty six, \"River\" by Tatsuya Ishii from twenty seven to thirty nine, and \"Find the Way\" by Mika Nakashima towards the end. The English TV dub used a 30-second shortened version of \"Invoke\" as its opening, but used the same endings as the original. The English DVD dub uses the original openings in their original format. For Japan's HD remaster, Gundam SEED cut the two recap episodes from its original broadcast (14 and 26). FictionJunction's new theme \"Distance\" replaced all uses of \"River\" with the exception of episode 40 with by FictionJunction.

The stunt is generally performed by driving one pair of wheels up on a ramp to lift one side of the car. Alternately, the stunt can be done in a vehicle with a high center of gravity (such as a 4x4 or SUV) by turning sharply or at speed. This technique is more dangerous because there is a strong possibility of the vehicle tipping completely over. Another technique is to let some air out of the tires that will be on the ground, so that the car can tip more easily, as well as keep its balance better. Once up on two wheels, the car has to be balanced by steering (much as one would when riding a bicycle), which makes it necessary to drive more or less in a straight line. The vehicle used must also be fitted with a lockable differential (common on 4x4s). The stunt was perfected and first performed at the 1964 World Fair by Tonny Peterson of Copenhagen, Denmark.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"High Treason is a 1951 British espionage thriller.

It is a multirole fighter for all-weather, air-to-air and air-to-surface deep interdiction missions. The Su-30 started out as an internal development project in the Sukhoi Su-27 family by Sukhoi. The design plan was revamped and the name was made official by the Russian Defense Ministry in 1996. Of the Flanker family, the Su-27, Su-30, Su-33, Su-34 and Su-35 have been ordered into limited or serial production by the Defense Ministry. Only the Su-37 remained a prototype. The Su-30 has two distinct version branches, manufactured by competing organisations: KnAAPO and the Irkut Corporation, both of which come under the Sukhoi group's umbrella. KnAAPO manufactures the Su-30MKK and the Su-30MK2, which were designed for and sold to China, and later Indonesia, Uganda, Venezuela, and Vietnam. Due to KnAAPO's involvement from the early stages of developing Su-35, these are basically a two-seat version of the mid-1990s Su-35. The Chinese chose an older but lighter radar so the canards could be omitted in return for increased payload. It is a fighter with both air supremacy and attack capabilities, generally similar to the U.S. F-15E. Irkut traditionally served the Soviet Air Defense and, in the early years of Flanker development, was given the responsibility of manufacturing the Su-27UB, the two-seat trainer version. When India showed interests in the Su-30, Irkut offered the multirole Su-30MKI, which originated as the Su-27UB modified with avionics appropriate for fighters. Along with its ground-attack capabilities, the series adds features for the air-superiority role, such as canards, thrust-vectoring, and a long-range phased-array radar. Its derivatives include the Su-30MKM, MKA, and SM for Malaysia, Algeria, and Russia, respectively. The Russian Air Force operates several Su-30s and has ordered the Su-30SM version.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Luciano Pucci Burti (born 5 March 1975, in São Paulo) is a Brazilian racing driver who briefly raced in Formula One.

The uniqueness of this park lies in the fact that it was established at the initiative of the local people and not by the State Department of wildlife who are responsible for wildlife preservation in Ghana. It is one of only 3 locations in Africa with a canopy walkway, which is 350 m long and connects seven tree tops which provides access to the forest. The most notable endangered species of fauna in the park are Diana monkey, giant bongo antelope, yellow-backed duiker and African elephant. It is also an Important Bird Area recognized by the Bird Life International with the bird area fully overlapping the park area. The bird inventory confirmed 266 species in the park, including eight species of global conservation concern. One of these species of concern is the white-breasted guineafowl. Nine species of hornbill and the grey parrot have been recorded. It is very rich in butterflies as well, and a new species was discovered in 1993.

It uses a tilt-rod fuze combined with a shaped charge to attack the belly of vehicles as they pass over the mine. It was originally designed in 1955, but is now obsolete. The mine consists of a case shaped like two truncated cones joined at the base. The MVK-2 tilt rod assembly is held to one side of the mine. The lower truncated cone contains the main charge, and dished metal charge liner. When a vehicle passes over the mine, the tilt rod is bent by 24 to 36 degrees, which allows retaining balls holding the striker to escape, which is driven by a spring into the MD-7M detonator. This then ignites a detonator cord, which carries the detonation wave into the main body of the mine and the DUM-2 detonator, fixed at the bottom of the main charge. The main charge is triggered, and the blast wave travels around a wave shaper, which improves the efficiency of the shaped charge. The resulting blast can penetrate between 60 and 110 millimeters of around depending on if the slightly less powerful TNT, or the more powerful TG-50 explosive is used. It is found in Afghanistan, Angola, Azerbaijan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iraq, Mozambique and Namibia.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Elliotts of Newbury EoN or Elliotts EoN A.P.4 was a 1940s British four-seat touring monoplane aircraft built by Elliotts of Newbury.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Robert Lamartine (June 15, 1935 – January 16, 1990) was a French football midfielder.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"A Blueprint for Murder is a 1953 thriller film noir starring Joseph Cotten, Jean Peters, and Gary Merrill.

Pataliputra was a seat of learning and fine arts. Patliputra was home to many astrologers and scholars including Aryabhata, Panini, Vātsyāyana, Chanakya and Kālidāsa. Its population during the Maurya period (around 300 BCE) was about 400,000. Patna served as the seat of power, political and cultural centre of Indian subcontinent during the Maurya and Gupta empires. With the fall of Gupta Empire, Patna lost its glory. It was revived again in the 17th century by the British as a centre of international trade. Following the partition of Bengal presidency in 1912, Patna became the capital of Bihar and Orissa Province. The modern city of Patna is situated on the southern bank of river Ganges.

Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, it is the world's second-largest restaurant chain (as measured by sales) after McDonald's, with almost 20,000 locations globally in 123 countries and territories . The chain is a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, a restaurant company that also owns the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains. KFC was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders, an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky during the Great Depression. Sanders identified the potential of the restaurant franchising concept, and the first \"Kentucky Fried Chicken\" franchise opened in Utah in 1952. KFC popularized chicken in the fast food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger. By branding himself as \"Colonel Sanders\", Harland became a prominent figure of American cultural history, and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising. However, the company's rapid expansion overwhelmed the aging Sanders and he sold it to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey in 1964. KFC was one of the first American fast food chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Jamaica by the mid-1960s. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, it experienced mixed fortunes domestically, as it went through a series of changes in corporate ownership with little or no experience in the restaurant business. In the early 1970s, KFC was sold to the spirits distributor Heublein, which was taken over by the R.J. Reynolds food and tobacco conglomerate; that company sold the chain to PepsiCo. The chain continued to expand overseas, however, and in 1987, it became the first Western restaurant chain to open in China. It has since expanded rapidly in China, which is now the company's single largest market. PepsiCo spun off its restaurants division as Tricon Global Restaurants, which later changed its name to Yum! Brands. KFC's original product is pressure fried chicken pieces, seasoned with Sanders' recipe of 11 herbs and spices. The constituents of the recipe represent a notable trade secret. Larger portions of fried chicken are served in a cardboard \"bucket\", which has become a well known feature of the chain since it was first introduced by franchisee Pete Harman in 1957. Since the early 1990s, KFC has expanded its menu to offer other chicken products such as chicken fillet sandwiches and wraps, as well as salads and side dishes, such as French fries and coleslaw, desserts, and soft drinks, the latter often supplied by PepsiCo. KFC is known for its slogans \"Finger Lickin' Good\", \"Nobody does chicken like KFC\" and \"So good\".","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Gustavo Adolfo Espina Salguero (born 1946) was Vice President of Guatemala for President Jorge Serrano from 1991–1993 and President from June 1–5, 1993.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"For the 19th century Venezuelan politician with similar name, see Francisco de Miranda Francisco de Sá de Miranda (28 August 1481 &ndash; 17 May 1558; ) was a Portuguese poet of the Renaissance.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Matthias Bernard Braun (Czech: Matyáš Bernard Braun, 24 February 1684 in Sautens near Innsbruck &ndash; 15 February 1738 in Prague) was a sculptor and carver active in the Czech lands, one of the most prominent late baroque style sculptors in the area. Matthias Bernard Braun was born as the fifth child of Jacob Braun and Magdalene born Neureuter. He apprenticed in Austria (Salzburg) and Italy (Venice, Bologna, Rome). And in his work, it is the Italian influence, that is the most prominent. He was inspired by Michelangelo Buonarroti, Gian Lorenzo Bernini and by the Venetian sculptural school of the 17th century and thus became a great propagator of the Italian-provenience sculpture in the Central-European context. Some time before 1710, Braun came to visit Prague, already as a full-fledged artist creating from sandstone, and soon he became domestic in Bohemia. He found his wife and friends there, and became a citizen to the New Town of Prague. Already his first work - the statuary of the Vision of St. Luthgard (Czech: Vidění sv. Luitgardy) from 1710, situated on Charles Bridge in Prague - brought to him much attention and many new orders. Braun then was able to found the biggest workshop in Prague, employing six journeymen and having an income of 900 golden a year around 1725. Soon, he himself could not manage the amount of new commissions for Prague palaces, gardens, churches and many other places in Bohemia, a situation worsened by the progressing tuberculosis. That is why he only created the designs and models, had his cooperators realize them and completed the work into the final appearance. He had five children, none of which continued his work, though. He died in Prague in 1738. Matthias Braun is probably the most famous for his collection of the allegories of Virtues and Vices situated at the Kuks Hospital in Bohemia, a commission of count František Antonín Špork. Other notable sculptures include: the Bethlehem - monumental statues chiselled directly in sandstone rocks near Kuks, forty pitoresque statues of dwarfs at the Kuks race-course, several statuaries at Charles Bridge in Prague, statues in the St. Kliment's church (Prague), the stone pillar of the Holy Trinity in Teplice, the sculptures in the interior of Czernin palace (Prague), and many others.

Sampling was originally developed by experimental musicians working with musique concrète and electroacoustic music, who physically manipulated tape loops or vinyl records on a phonograph. By the late 1960s, the use of tape loop sampling influenced the development of minimalist music and the production of psychedelic rock and jazz fusion. Hip hop music was the first popular music genre based on the art of sampling – being born from 1970s DJs who experimented with manipulating vinyl on two turntables and an audio mixer. The use of sampling in popular music spread with the rise of electronic music and disco in the mid-1970s to early 1980s, the development of electronic dance music and industrial music in the 1980s, and the worldwide influence of hip hop since the 1980s on genres ranging from contemporary R&B to indie rock. Historically, sampling was most often done with a sampler — a specialized piece of hardware — but today, a computer program is more commonly used. However, vinyl emulation software may also be used, and turntablists continue to sample using traditional methods. The inclusion of sampling tools in modern digital production methods increasingly introduced sampling into many genres of popular music, as well as genres predating the invention of sampling, such as classical music, jazz and various forms of traditional music. Often \"samples\" consist of one part of a song, such as a rhythm break, which is then used to construct the beat for another song. For instance, hip hop music developed from DJs looping the breaks from songs to enable continuous dancing. The \"Funky Drummer\" break and the Amen break, both brief fragments taken from soul and funk music recordings of the late 1960s, have been among the most common samples used in dance music and hip hop of recent decades, with some entire subgenres like breakbeat being based largely on complex permutations of a single one of these samples. Samples from rock recordings have also been the basis of new songs; for example, the drum introduction from Led Zeppelin's \"When the Levee Breaks\" was sampled by artists such as the Beastie Boys, Dr. Dre, Eminem, Mike Oldfield, Rob Dougan, Coldcut, Depeche Mode and Erasure. Samples can also consist of spoken words and phrases, including those in non-musical media such as movies, TV shows and advertising. Sampling does not necessarily mean using pre-existing recordings. A number of composers and musicians have constructed pieces or songs by sampling field recordings they made themselves, and others have sampled their own original recordings. The musicians in the trip hop band Portishead, for example, made some use of existing samples, but also scratched, manipulated and sampled musical parts they themselves had originally played in order to construct their songs. The use of sampling is controversial legally and musically. Experimental musicians who pioneered the technique in the 1940s to the 1960s sometimes did not inform or receive permission from the subjects of their field recordings or from copyright owners before constructing a musical piece out of these samples. In the 1970s, when hip hop was confined to local dance parties, it was unnecessary to obtain copyright clearance in order to sample recorded music at these parties. As the genre became a recorded form centred on rapping in the 1980s and subsequently went mainstream, it became necessary to pay to obtain legal clearance for samples, which was difficult for all but the most successful DJs, producers and rappers. As a result, a number of recording artists ran into legal trouble for uncredited samples, while the restrictiveness of current US copyright laws and their global impact on creativity also came under increased scrutiny. Aside from legal issues, sampling has been both championed and criticized. Hip-hop DJs today take different approaches to sampling, with some critical of its obvious use. Some critics, particularly those with a rockist outlook, have expressed the belief all sampling is lacking in creativity, while others say sampling has been innovative and revolutionary. Those whose own work has been sampled have also voiced a wide variety of opinions about the practice, both for and against sampling.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Łosień is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Piekoszów, within Kielce County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central Poland.

It was offered with the familiar B series petrol engine in 1622cc form. Claimed power output was 49 bhp, with a compression ratio of 7.2:1. The van was rated on a gross-weight basis rather than on the more familiar (for UK buyers at the time) load carrying capability. The number '250' in its name was intended to indicate a gross loaded weight of 2½ imperial (British) tons, implying a substantial carrying capacity of 22 cwt. When road tested by Britain's Autocar magazine, a 250 JU vehicle converted into a 4,180 lb motor home achieved a maximum speed of 58 mph (93 km/h). The testers thought the van a big improvement over the J2 which it replaced, but found it remained \"clumsy to drive\" with the \"need for constant expertise to overcome its faults\": engine noise, especially above 40 mph (64 km/h) was a particular source of criticism. Following the formation of the British Leyland Motor Corporation in 1968, into which BMC, by then a subsidiary of British Motor Holdings, had been absorbed, the van was branded as the BMC 250 JU. It was then rebadged again in 1970 as the 'Austin Morris 250 JU', finally ending production in the wake of the Leyland Sherpa, with which it shared some components, in 1974. In addition to the standard panel vans, 250 JU chassis were also made available to specialist manufacturers for conversion into motor homes Neither the development nor the marketing of the van appears to have been prioritized by its manufacturers.

The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 24 October 1601, and first published in quarto in 1602 by the booksellers Matthew Lownes and Thomas Fisher. The title page of the first quarto states that the play was acted by the Children of Paul's, one of the companies of boy actors popular at the time. It was followed by a sequel, ''Antonio's Revenge'', which was written by Marston in 1600. The play is a romantic comedy, which charts the \"comic crosses of true love\" faced by Antonio, son of the good Duke Andrugio, and Mellida, daughter of the wicked Duke Piero. Structurally, the plot is quite conventional, but the tone is unusual: Marston undercuts the emotion of the story of the separated lovers by introducing moments of extreme farce and burlesque, satirising and parodying romantic comedy conventions. The play also employs a metatheatrical induction, in which the boy actors are seen, apparently in propria persona, discussing the roles they are about to play and the way in which their parts should be performed.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"A Shack–Hartmann (or Hartmann–Shack) wavefront sensor (SHWFS) is an optical instrument used for characterizing an imaging system. It is a wavefront sensor commonly used in adaptive optics systems. It consists of an array of lenses (called lenslets) of the same focal length. Each is focused onto a photon sensor (typically a CCD array or CMOS array or quad-cell ). The local tilt of the wavefront across each lens can then be calculated from the position of the focal spot on the sensor. Any phase aberration can be approximated by a set of discrete tilts. By sampling an array of lenslets, all of these tilts can be measured and the whole wavefront approximated. Since only tilts are measured the Shack–Hartmann cannot detect discontinuous steps in the wavefront. The design of this sensor was based on an aperture array that had been developed in 1900 by Johannes Franz Hartmann as a means of tracing individual rays of light through the optical system of a large telescope, thereby testing the quality of the image. In the late 1960s, Roland Shack and Ben Platt modified the Hartmann screen by replacing the apertures in an opaque screen by an array of lenslets. The terminology as proposed by Shack and Platt was Hartmann screen. The fundamental principle seems to be documented even before Huygens by the Jesuit philosopher, Christopher Scheiner, in Austria. Shack–Hartmann sensors are used to characterize eyes for corneal treatment of complex refractive errors. Recently, Pamplona et al. developed an inverse of the Shack–Hartmann system to measure one's eye lens aberrations. While Shack–Hartmann sensors measure localized slope of the wavefront error using spot displacement in sensor plane, Pamplona et al. make the user shift the spots till they are aligned.

It is diametrically opposed to Bhangra music in that it is not a live music but instead relies on pre recorded musical parts with only the vocals being sung live along to a live repetitive dhol drum. The pre recorded music consists of primarily looped rhythm parts from both eastern and western percussion instruments and little to no melody on instruments. It borrows heavily from hip hop, however it is more traditional than its predecessor, Bhangra which rebelled against tradition and authenticity. Traditional folk instruments like dhol and tumbi are central to folkhop productions. Folkhop songs tend to be heavily produced by DJs on computer software. In the beginning, all songs start out as vocal only recordings that the folk singer records in India. This 'vocal only' recording is then sold on websites involved in the buying and selling of folkhop music. The DJs then pay a small sum for the rights to these vocals, and then set the music using looped samples of both hip hop and traditional folk instruments. The quintessential folkhop artist is the bedroom DJ. Folkhop albums typically feature no credits on musicians, instead liner notes simply feature 'big ups' to online friends of the folkhop DJ.Whereas Bhangra music was centered on bands delivering live performances with focus on instrumentation (as evidenced by Bhangra videos), folkhop shares with rap and hip hop \"common textual aspects, as well as similarities in their onstage and video performance practices: an obsession with materialism, or an expressed desire or boasting of \"bling\", in the form of jewelry, wealth or clothing\" It also features an obsession with farming and rural lifestyle such as livestock, tractors traditional clothes etc. Many folkhop videos showcase rappers and folk singers in the midst of farms or riding on tractors.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"De Vargas is a Spanish surname.

Although the term substance can refer to any physical matter, 'substance' in this context is limited to psychoactive drugs. Addiction and dependence are components of a substance use disorder and addiction represents the most severe form of the disorder. A SUD involves the overuse of, or dependence on, a drug leading to effects that are detrimental to the individual's physical and mental health, or the welfare of others. An SUD is characterized by a pattern of continued pathological use of a medication, non-medically indicated drug or toxin, which results in repeated adverse social consequences related to drug use, such as failure to meet work, family, or school obligations, interpersonal conflicts, or legal problems. There are ongoing debates as to the exact distinctions between substance abuse and substance dependence, but current practice standard distinguishes between the two by defining substance dependence in terms of physiological and behavioral symptoms of substance use, and substance abuse in terms of the social consequences of substance use. In the DSM-5 substance use disorder replaced substance abuse and substance dependence. Another term, substance-related disorder, has also been used. In 2010 about 5% of people (230 million) used an illicit substance.

The staple food of a specific society may be eaten as often as every day or every meal, and most people live on a diet based on just a small number of staples. Staple foods vary from place to place, but typically they are inexpensive or readily-available foods that supply one or more of the three organic macronutrients needed for survival and health: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Typical examples of staples include tubers and roots; and grains, legumes, and other seeds. Early agricultural civilizations valued the foods that they established as staples because, in addition to providing necessary nutrition, they generally are suitable for storage over long periods of time without decay. Such nonperishable foods are the only possible staples during seasons of shortage, such as dry seasons or cold temperate winters, against which times harvests have been stored. During seasons of plenty, wider choices of foods may be available. Main staple foods are derived either from vegetables and animal products, including cereals (such as rice, wheat, maize, millet, or sorghum), starchy tubers or root vegetables (such as potatoes, cassava, yams, or taro), meat, fish, eggs, milk, and cheese. Other staple foods include pulses (dried legumes), sago (derived from the pith of the sago palm tree), and fruits (such as breadfruit and plantains).

Since 2010 the organizers have reorganized the route to increase the portion of singletrack and decrease the potentially boggy and muddy sections, while maintaining the spectacular scenery and wilderness riding that the race is known for. Attracting riders from all over the world, the race has grown from 67 two-person teams in 2002 to a sold-out fields of 225 two-person teams in 2006, 290 teams in 2007, 240 teams in 2008 and 118 teams in 2009. The decline in teams in 2009 was attributed to the challenging worldwide economic conditions and the strong appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar. For 2009 the organizers added the solo TR3 category allowing riders to compete without a partner. The TR3 riders only completed the first three stages of the race, finishing at the Nipika Mountain Resort. Starting in 2011 the three stages of the TR3 utilized the single track trails around Fernie. In 2010 the race received UCI sanctioning with both the 7-day TransRockies and the 3-day TR3 granted S2 status. This change increased both the total number of riders and the level of competition in all categories. 2010 also saw the introduction of the TR4. This solo option allowed riders to complete the last four days of the race to finish in Canmore.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Michael M.

XXII/12) is a mass in B-flat major written by Joseph Haydn and named after Maria Theresa of the Two Sicilies, empress consort of Francis II. The empress herself was the soprano soloist at private performances of both The Creation and The Seasons in May 1801 at the Viennese Court. The title does not appear on the autograph score, which is labeled simply with the Latin word \"Missa\". Between 1796 and 1802, Haydn composed six masses to celebrate the name-day of Princess Maria Josepha Hermenegilde (1768-1845), who was the wife of his patron Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy II. The Theresienmesse, written in 1799, belongs in this series. The work is thought to have been premiered on 8 September 1799. The location was the Bergkirche, near the Esterházy family seat in Eisenstadt, Austria. The mass is scored for solo quartet, chorus, strings, two clarinets, two trumpets, timpani and organ continuo. Concerning the paucity of winds (no oboes, bassoons, horns, or flutes) John W. Ehrlich has written: While probably not as frequently performed as its companions the Nelson Mass or the Missa in tempore belli, the Theresienmesse has attracted critical admiration; Ehrlich for instance refers to it as an \"extraordinary work.\" Another commentator writes, \"Haydn's choral writing has all the variety, rhythmic energy and contrapuntal skill of a composer at the height of his powers.\"","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Komesha is one of the 20 woredas in the Benishangul-Gumuz Region of Ethiopia.

The building, designed by Moses Chamberlain Edey, opened as the T. Lindsay department store on June 21, 1905 and was Ottawa's first department store. It was located at the prominent intersection of Rideau Street and Sussex Drive. The building was the only Chicago Style structure built in Ottawa, and one of the few such buildings erected in Canada. Later owned by A.E. Rae & Co, it was expanded at the north end and two additional stories were added in 1913. H.J. Daly acquired the building in 1915. The Daly Building became a government office building in 1921 and served this role for many decades. Owned by the National Capital Commission (NCC), they had the cornice removed in 1964 after stone fell from it killing a pedestrian on the street below. The building was left unrenovated. In 1978 it was abandoned as unsuitable for office work. During the 1980s, the NCC tried to find a company that would restore the building, and in 1987 a Montreal firm was given a $45 million contract to restore the structure. However, when the building was examined it was found that portions were structurally unsound, and if it were to be restored large sections would have to be wholly rebuilt. Further studies found that if left alone the building posed a danger to the public, and could collapse under winter snow. The developers did not have the funds to do such an extensive project, and in a controversial decision the NCC chose not to look for a new partner and in September 1991 authorized the destruction of the building. This was the first designated heritage building destroyed in the city since the heritage guidelines were introduced in 1982. It was a hugely controversial decision in Ottawa, that drew much criticism of the NCC both for the years of neglect that let the building decline and for the final decision to demolish it. It was demolished piecemeal circa October 1991-March 1992. The Daly Building site remained vacant for more than a decade. There was much discussion of what would be built there; some advocated a park, and for a time there was a scheme to build a national aquarium on the site.

Originally, Zoutelande was mainly an agricultural village.

Zoutelande was a separate municipality until 1966, when it became a part of the new municipality Valkenisse. Nowadays, tourism is Zoutelande's most important source of existence. Zoutelande, together with the beach of Dishoek and Westkapelle, are often called \"Zeeland's Rivièra\", after the famous south-coast of France. It is one of Zeeland's most-visited coasts, and one of the few places in the Netherlands where the beach faces south. Plenty of rooms, studios, bungalows and apartments are available to thousands of visitors every summer; most of the tourists are of German origin, although other nationalities are also widely represented. The remaining agriculture in the area benefits of the demand for accommodation in the form of mini-campings. Bicycle-rental, beachfront establishments, hotels, B&Bs, shops and a nice boulevard are all to be found in and around the village.

He was the son of Thomas Teshmaker Busk (1852–1894) and Mary Busk née Acworth (1854–1935), of Hermongers, Rudgwick, Sussex. After attaining First Class Honours in Mechanical Sciences at Cambridge in June 1912 he became Assistant Engineer at the newly formed Royal Aircraft Factory, Farnborough, later the Royal Aircraft Establishment. Here he devoted much of his time to the mathematics and dynamics of stable flight. In the early years of powered flight inherent stability in an aircraft was a most important quality. Busk took his theories into the air and tried them out in practice. In 1913 this work was used in the R.E.1 (Reconnaissance Experimental), claimed as the first inherently stable aeroplane, and resulted in the development of the B.E.2c. The remarkable feature of this design was that there was no single device that was the cause of the stability. The stability resulted from detailed design of each part of the aircraft, with due regard to its relation to, and effect on, other parts in the air. Weights and areas were so arranged that under most conditions the machine would tend to right itself. Busk was killed on 5 November 1914 while flying a B.E.2 which caught fire at Laffans Plain (now Farnborough Airfield), near Aldershot. He was buried at Aldershot Military Cemetery with full military honours. His genius and his courage were recognised by the posthumous award of the Gold Medal of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain, and amongst the many letters of condolence received by his mother was one from King George V. His youngest brother, Hans Acworth Busk (b. 1894), was reported missing on 6 January 1916, last seen flying a heavy bombing aeroplane against the Turks at Gallipoli. They were both survived by their mother (author of \"E.T. Busk, a pioneer in flight\"), by sister Mary Agnes Dorothea Morse (1888–1960) and by brother Henry Gould Busk (1890–1956).","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"2100 Ross Avenue (formerly San Jacinto Tower ) is a 33-story postmodern skyscraper located at 2100 Ross Avenue /2121 San Jacinto Street in the City Center District of downtown Dallas, Texas, in the United States.

P. Herbert. It premiered on 16 January 1931 at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, and later transferred to the New Theatre. The play ran for six months, later touring England and being staged in Australia and America. Some critics rated it among the best of the interwar period. The music was originally intended to be composed by Alfred Reynolds, who would later collaborate with Herbert on Derby Day, but Dunhill was chosen as the preferred composer after Reynolds had begun work. It is set in the present day (the early 1930s), and plays on the contrasts and conflicts between urban bohemians and the rural aristocracy, between the artists and the hunting set, or – as one song describes it, \"between Orpheus and Hercules\". The work is an example of a lyric opera (opéra lyrique) in that it consists of sung verse, with no prose speech; this contrasts with the opéra comique, which does contain spoken dialogue between the musical numbers; both genres include serious (or even tragic) works, and comedies.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Kenute Tulloch (born 4 July 1965 in Jamaica) is a Cayman Islands cricketer.

He received his MSc-degree in Electrical Engineering (1950) and his PhD-degree in the Technological Sciences (1958) from Delft University of Technology, Delft, the Netherlands, both with the highest distinction (cum laude). He served Delft University of Technology as an Assistant Professor (1950-1957), Associate Professor (1957-1960) and Full Professor in Electromagnetic Theory and Applied Mathematics (1960-1996). Since 1996 he is Lorentz Chair Emeritus Professor in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics Computer Science of this University. In 1970 he founded at Delft the Laboratory of Electromagnetic Research, which has developed into a world-class center for electro-magnetics, having a huge impact on the world's electromagnetic community and on electromagnetic research and education in the Netherlands. Dr. De Hoop's research interests are in the broad area of wavefield modeling in acoustics, electromagnetics and elastodynamics. His interdisciplinary insights and methods in this field can be found in his seminal Handbook of Radiation and Scattering of Waves (1995), with wavefield reciprocity serving as one of the unifying principles governing direct and inverse scattering problems and wave propagation in complex (anisotropic and dispersive) media. He spent a year (1956-1957) as a Research Assistant with the Institute of Geophysics, University of California at Los Angeles, CA, USA, where he pioneered a modification of the Cagniard technique for calculating impulsive wave propagation in layered media, later to be known as the Cagniard–de Hoop method. This technique is considered as a benchmark tool in analyzing time-domain wave propagation. During a sabbatical leave at Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium, Eindhoven, the Netherlands (1976-1977), he was involved in research on magnetic recording theory. Since 1982, Dr. De Hoop is, on a regular basis, Visiting Scientist with Schlumberger-Doll Research, formerly at Ridgefield, CT, now at Cambridge, MA, USA, where he contributes to research on geophysical applications of acoustic, electromagnetic and elastodynamic waves. Grants from the \"Stichting Fund for Science, Technology and Research\" (founded by Schlumberger) supported his research at Delft University of Technology. He was awarded the 1989 Research Medal of the Royal Institute of Engineers (KIVI) in the Netherlands, the IEEE 2001 Heinrich Hertz Medal and the 2002 URSI (International Scientific Radio Union) Balthasar van der Pol Gold Research Medal. In 2003, Beatrix, Queen of the Netherlands appointed him Knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion. De Hoop is a Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1989 and a Foreign Member of the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts. He holds an Honorary Doctorate (1981) in the Applied Sciences from Ghent University, Belgium and an Honorary Doctorate (2008) in the Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences from Växjö University (since 2010, Linnaeus University), Växjö, Sweden. He is exploring a method for computing pulsed electromagnetic fields in strongly heterogeneous media with application to (micro- or nano-scale) integrated circuits and a methodology for time-domain pulsed-field antenna analysis, design and optimization for mobile communication and radar applications.
