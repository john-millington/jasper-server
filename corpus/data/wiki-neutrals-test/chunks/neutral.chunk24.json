It is a large booby, smaller than gannets, and is placed within its own monotypic genus. It was first identified from a specimen collected by William Louis Abbott, who discovered it on Assumption Island in 1892. Abbott's booby breeds only in a few spots on the Australian territory of Christmas Island in the eastern Indian Ocean, although it formerly had a much wider range. It has white plumage with black markings, and is adapted for long-distance flight. It forages around Christmas Island, often around nutrient-rich oceanic upwellings, although individuals can travel for thousands of kilometres. Pairs mate for life and raise one chick every two or three years, nesting near the top of emergent trees in the rainforest canopy. The population is decreasing. Historically much of its former habitat was logged to make way for phosphate mining. Some logging continues, and the effects of the former logging continue to adversely affect the current population. Another threat has been caused by the introduction of yellow crazy ants, which decrease habitat quality. Minimal habitat declines have a significant effect on the bird population. All nesting areas have been included in a national park.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Twilight Sad are a Scottish post-punk/indie rock band, comprising James Graham (vocals) and Andy MacFarlane (guitar).

The Twilight Sad's notoriously loud live performances have been described as \"completely ear-splitting,\" and the band toured for the album across Europe and the United States throughout 2007 and 2008. Sessions inspired by stripped-down and reworked live performances yielded the 2008 mini-album, Here, It Never Snowed. Afterwards It Did. Their second album, Forget the Night Ahead, marked a shift in the band's direction; lyrically more personal and musically darker and more streamlined, it was released in 2009 to further acclaim. Recording sessions for the album also produced the mid-2010 release The Wrong Car, which followed the departure of founding bassist Craig Orzel in February 2010. The Twilight Sad's third album, No One Can Ever Know, was released in February 2012 and marked another stylistic shift, with the band citing industrial music and krautrock influences for a darker, sparser sound.

Specializing in creating public installations, Tay directly engages her audiences with the societal themes to do with the Singapore society. She is also a pioneer in innovative and interactive contemporary work for children in Singapore. Born the 3rd of 7 children, Tay's passion for art was very much in her blood since young. As she could not afford herself an art education, art took a backseat, and she joined the workforce soon after finishing her Cambridge GCE O Level Examinations, to help support her family. During her career, she had opportunities to backpack and travel to other countries. With each travel experience of different life and culture, her calling growing stronger. In 1997, Tay quit her job as an accounts executive to study art full-time at Lasalle-SIA College of the Arts, under the Georgette Chen Art Scholarship funded by the College. From the time she graduated in 1999, Tay participated in many arts activities and festivals, such as the 2000 & 2004 Art Festival projects at Clifford Pier for \"Tracking Time\" and St James Power Station for the exhibition \"Reconstruction of a City\". Tay had also received two Honorable Mentions at Philip Morris Singapore Art Award in 2002 and 1999, and a Commendation Award at the Singapore Power Ltd Art Competition in 1998. Tay is passionate with creating works that engage social thinking in Singapore. Her strong tone of self-expression is found in notable works such as the \"Her World\" series featured in her 2nd solo exhibition in 2005; her steel sculpture, entitled \"Caterpillar\", echoed her concerns for the environment and the society. In \"Her World\", Tay critiqued women's obsession towards the beauty standards defined by magazines and the fashion/beauty industry. As a result of this obsession, consumerism created an addiction for women seeking to beautify themselves for the pleasure of men; women seek to empower themselves as independent, modern, and free from the dependence of men. This, she believed, leads to a false sense of beauty and self-esteem in themselves. The \"Caterpillar\" sculpture is another work of art by Tay, commissioned under partnership programme between National Arts Council and City Developments Ltd. The 15-metre long and 2.3-metre high steel sculpture is lined with 30 poster boxes to look like a caterpillar. The sculpture also has a pragmatic function, serving as a publicity platform to promote arts and cultural activities in a community setting. Tay's ingenuity intends to remind us that caterpillars are tiny environmental indicators of nature, and because their sightings are increasingly rare due to urbanization, humans need to learn to become even more environmentally-conscious. In 2013, her installation \"Knot, Play, Rest\" encouraged people to come together to \"meet, communicate and play\", in her fabric rope playground in the real world, as people are becoming more detached in this age of technology. This work is one of the installation works featured in the 2013 Singapore Biennale. As much as Tay's works resonate well with her audiences, her works had also sparked a controversy in the arts fraternity. In 2002, her installation of 600 small handcrafted lip-shaped fabric cushions was on display at the atrium of Suntec City, as part of Nokia Singapore Art 2001 exhibition. Unfortunately, the installation became too well-received, resulting with a majority of her small cushions being stolen by the public during the exhibition period. In spite of obstacles in her career, Tay continues to believe in communicating a 'social voice' through her fabrics, and at the same time, transform the lives of her audience by instilling self-confidence and creative expression. This spirit was demonstrated in her work with the Asian Women’s Welfare Association (AWWA), and mentioned at a speech delivered by Acting Minister Lawrence Wong, at The 2013 Committee Of Supply Debate at the Parliament.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Michalczowa is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Łososina Dolna, within Nowy Sącz County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland.

It is located within the High Black Forest and lies in a hollow formed by ice age glaciation between the villages of Altglashütten, Falkau and Aha on the territory of the municipality of Lenzkirch. The lake lies in a trough that runs from the Seebach valley in the northwest to the Schluchsee in the southeast and thus crosses the generally northeastward-running streams in the area. This remnant of a former valley is followed by the Three Lakes Railway that was built between 1920 and 1926 and by the transfer channel (Überleitungskanal), built in 1932 and belonging to the Schluchseewerk, which takes water from the Seebach valley via the Haslach valley to the Schluchsee Basin. North of the low-lying watershed in this trough, between the Haslach in the north and the Ahabach in the south, now drowned by the impounded Schluchsee, the glacier of the last ice age carved out a basin, in which a small bog lake formed, the natural precursor to today's reservoir. This was enlarged in 1895 by the former Falkau Screw Works (Schraubenfabrik Falkau) with a dam in the north and the water surface raised by about 6 metres. At the same time the lake, which had only hitherto been fed from the east by the Kähnerbächle, was given another inflow in the form of a small leat (Hangkanal) from the southwest. Since 1932 the Windgfällweiher has been incorporated into the transfer of water from the Seebach to the Schluchsee (covered leat) and drained since then in the opposite direction i.e. to the south. The water is led via a ditch over the low watershed, initially as the Windgefällbach and later, the Schwarzach, into the Schluchsee. Since 1950 the lake has been protected. In 2002 an angling and fish consumption ban was announced, because PCB had been discovered in the sediment depositions on the bottom of the lake. On the wooded eastern shore of the Windgfällweiher, a lake barely touched by the streams of visitors to the area, lies a rather less picturesque bathing beach with a listed building. The Windgfällweiher, together with the Schluchsee and Titisee, contributed to the name of the Three Lakes Railway.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Félix Labisse (March 9, 1905January 27, 1982) was a French Surrealist painter, illustrator, and designer.

Ezibeleni is the largest township in the Queenstown area. Its original name was Queensdale, named after Queenstown. It is divided into zones (1,2,3,Chancele & Themba), with the new units; known as Kwamabuyaze (RDP houses) which is still expanding. The majority of people resident in Ezibeleni live below the living wage according to government economic classifications. There are about 12 schools in the area, 4 lower primary, 3 senior primary, 3 lower high and 2 senior high schools.

Aerobatics can be performed by a single aircraft or in formation with several others. Nearly all aircraft are capable of performing aerobatics maneuvers of some kind, although it may not be legal or safe to do so in certain aircraft. Aerobatics consist of five basic maneuvers: Lines (both horizontal and vertical), loops, rolls, spins, and hammerheads. Most aerobatic figures are composites of these basic maneuvers with rolls superimposed. A loop is when the pilot pulls the plane up into the vertical, continues around until he is heading back in the same direction, like making a 360 degree turn, except it is in the vertical plane instead of the horizontal. The pilot will be inverted (upside down) at the top of the loop. A loop can also be performed by going inverted and making the same maneuver but diving towards the ground. It can be visualized as making a loop of ribbon, hence the name it is given (there is an animation depicting a loop on the bottom of this page). A roll is simply rotating the plane about its roll axis, using the ailerons. It can be done in increments of 360 degrees (i.e. four short 90 degree rolls will bring the aircraft back to its upright position). A spin is more complex, involving intentionally stalling a single wing, causing the plane to descend spiraling around its yaw axis in a corkscrew motion. A Hammerhead (also known as a stall turn) is performed by pulling the aircraft up until it's pointing straight up (much like the beginning of a loop), but he continues to fly straight up until his airspeed has dropped to a certain critical point. He then uses the rudder to rotate the aircraft around its yaw axis until it has turned 180deg and is pointing straight down, facing the direction he came from. The aircraft gains speed, and he continues back exactly the way he came. It is also known as a \"tailslide\", from the yawing turn, which is different from the typical method of turning an aircraft in the pitch axis.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Brian William Luckhurst (5 February 1939 – 1 March 2005) was an English cricketer, who played his entire county career for Kent County Cricket Club.

In the spring the underground stems produce compound leaves that are large and finely toothed. Tiny white flowers, typically in three, globe-shaped clusters wide, are produced on tall scapes that grow about the same height as the leaves. These bloom from May to July and develop into purple-black edible berries. The leaves go dormant in summer before the fruits ripen. The berries taste a little spicy and sweet. The stem of the plant grows straight up from the ground and divides into a whorl of 3 stems which branch up and out, each forming 3 to 7 (most often 5) pinnately compound leaflets; leaflets ovate, acute, serrate, green. Technically, all the leaflets on one plant are considered to be one entire leaf, and the stems that connect the leaflets are called rachis; this arrangement is called doubly compound. In some cases some of the leaflets are further completely subdivided, forming a triply compound pattern. This species is similar to Aralia hispida (Bristly Sarsaparilla), which is a little larger with stems covered with bristly hairs, hence the name. The stems of ''A. nudicaulis'' are smooth. The roots have been used as substitutes for true Sarsaparilla (Smilax sp.) in herbal medicine. This plant is so common in certain ecologies that it is an indicator species for these Eastern Forests of North America: Northern Hardwood Forest, Beech-Maple Forest, and Oak-Hickory Forest. Because it sometimes grows with groups of 3 leaflets, it can be mistaken for poison ivy; the way to tell the difference is that Wild Sarsaparilla lacks a woody base and has fine teeth along the edges of the leaves.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Lyubov Sergeyevna Zabolotskaya (, born April 2, 1956 in the village of Sardyk of Kirov Oblast) is a former Soviet cross country skier who competed during the early 1980s, being a member of the USSR Team between 1978 and 1985.

An Early Modern structure built from 1911-1912 by architects Kiehnel and Elliott, it originally served as the Central Turnverein, a German-American social and athletic association, and later known as the Central Athletic Association. It served as the site of various athletic contests, including some involving the University of Pittsburgh. During World War I, it was used to house those in the Student Army Training Corps. Following the war, a severe space shortage at the Dental School prompted the university to purchase the building in 1920 for use as a dental clinic and infirmary. Known then as the Infirmary Building, a annex was erected in 1922 creating enough space in the building to hold 200 dental chairs. The Gardner Steel Conference Center, as it is now known, is currently home to classrooms, computer labs, the Academic Resource Center, and the Innovation Institute. In 1995, the School of Engineering and the Department of Mathematics collaborated on a $250,000 joint project that created a laboratory for the computer instruction of calculus.

It was the first full season in charge for manager Tommy Docherty, who had been appointed the previous December following the dismissal of Frank O'Farrell. Only six seasons after winning the European Cup, United were relegated, meaning that they would be a Second Division club for the first time since 1938. Having been persuaded to return to the team after walking out during the previous season, the troubled George Best briefly returned to the side, but played his last game for the club on New Year's Day, and his contract was cancelled the following season after more than a decade at Old Trafford. Docherty took the unusual step of appointing goalkeeper Alex Stepney as the team's penalty taker. After 12 games, Stepney had converted two penalties, which made him the club's joint top scorer, a position he held for ten matches. United began the season with two victories in their first three games, but then recorded only four wins in twenty League games between September and March. A late-season run of victories raised the prospect of survival, but United stumbled as the season drew to an end. On the last full day of the season, United could survive only by winning their home game against Manchester City and then their rearranged game at Stoke City, provided that points were dropped by other relegation candidates, all of which had only one game remaining. In the event, United lost both games whilst their rivals' results meant that they would have been relegated anyway. The scorer of what proved to be the winning goal for Manchester City in United's penultimate game was former United player Denis Law, who scored with a back-heel in the 81st minute. He did not celebrate the goal, and was substituted shortly afterwards. The goal triggered a series of pitch invasions by Manchester United fans, perhaps hoping to get the match replayed, that forced the referee to abandon the game in the 85th minute. After a review, the Football League decided that the result should stand. This was the season in which the Football League increased the number of relegation places from two to three, and it is often incorrectly claimed that by winning at Old Trafford Manchester City \"relegated\" United. In fact, it was Birmingham City's win over Norwich City and West Ham United's point against Liverpool that sealed United's fate, since, with a win still worth only two points, United could not have caught Birmingham and West Ham even if they had won their last two fixtures. However, City's victory and Southampton's win at Everton meant that United finished in 21st place, and would still have been relegated under the old system. Already relegated, United then lost their last game of the season, against sixth-placed Stoke City. In spite of the relegation to the Second Division, the club's directors decided not to sack Docherty, placing their confidence in him to restore the club's First Division status at the first attempt.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Sonic Protest is a yearly music festival in France focused on left field music genres like experimental rock, electroacoustic music, improvised music, noise and avant garde music.

The technique can be used in either an unbiased (untargeted) or targeted metabolic profiling methodology by varying experimental design. The molecular contents of a cell are 'labeled' by replacing their entire carbon content with the stable carbon-13 () isotope, centered on either a 5% or 95% isotopic balance, in order to create unique, highly informative isotopic patterns. Previous methods of stable isotopic labeling relied on higher purity (typically 98-99% carbon-12) isotopic material which generate very weak (minimal) patterns. The use of randomly labeled, uniform isotopic abundance creates isotopic patterns (signatures) of such strength that they are easily detected and used, imparting many analytical advantages to the IROA method. When considering a stable isotope experiment, although many stable isotopes can be considered, it is important to use an isotope that exhibits minimal biological isotopic effect. The advantage of, which has only an 8% mass difference from , is that it is generally well tolerated by most cells. One advantage of the IROA protocol over other stable isotopic labeling techniques is that once the labeling step takes place all biologically derived molecules are distinguishable from artifacts (which are present at only natural abundance), and each peak has a signature of its origin, an M+1 for the sample and an M-1 for the  sample. The mass spectral scans from these pooled samples show the pairing of biological peaks allowing: 1) the removal of artifacts; and 2) the reinforced identification of the compounds the peaks represent because the distance between the paired peaks exactly corresponds to the number of carbons in the molecule.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Hamish Grant McNeil (16 November 1934 – 15 October 2017) was a Scottish former footballer who played in the Football League as a Wing half for Colchester United.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Eois cancellata is a moth in the family Geometridae.

Between 1912 and 1915 she attended Brenau University in Gainesville, Georgia. She graduated from Columbia University with an MA in sociology in 1919. She died in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on May 5, 1988. She was descended from a slaveholding family. Her grandfather owned approximately 1000 acres of land and 50 slaves in Oglethorpe County, Georgia. About this Lumpkin has written that her grandfather \"made his plantation provide for all his needs. On a place of this size he had to do so if he were to have any net cash income\". On southern slaveholders she has written that: \"Above all, he would know his slaves, each by name and each for his good points and foibles, most of them being inherited, or the children of those who had been handed down. He would expect constantly to guide and discipline and keep them contented by skillful handling. First and last, he would know that every plan, every decision, every quandary nagging his mind, save those of marketing his cotton and purchasing supplies from the outside, resolved itself into a human problem, if it could be so called: the problem of managing his black dependents. He would know he was master in all things on his plantation, everything, nothing excepted, including the life of his slaves. With it he would know that his station was secure as a southern gentleman. In her autobiography, Lumpkin describes her shock upon learning that her all-white chapter of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) would be addressed by a black woman named Miss Jane Arthur. She later said that \"the heavens had not fallen, nor the earth parted asunder to swallow us up in this unheard of transgression\". She compared it to the biblical story from the Book of Samuel about the man who had defied the law by touching the sacred Tabernacle of Jehovah. In realizing that nothing fundamentally distinguished Miss Arthur from a white woman, she said that she had touched the \"tabernacle of our sacred racial beliefs\" and \"not the slightest thing had happened\".","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Gymnoganascus stephani is a species in the family Aderidae (\"ant-like leaf beetles\"), in the order Coleoptera (\"beetles\").

He represented the riding of Ottawa in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1886 to 1898. He was born in Bolton, New York in 1844, the son of Henry Franklin Bronson, and came to Bytown with his family in 1853. Bronson was educated in Ottawa and New York City. He became a partner in the Bronsons and Weston Lumber Company in 1867 and took control of the company when his father died in 1889. Bronson served on Ottawa City Council from 1872 to 1877 and was a provincial minister in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1886 to 1898. He was also a public school board trustee for 18 years. Bronson was president of the Ottawa Power Company, Limited. This resulted from his efforts to diversify the family business. The power house and power plant at Chaudière Falls which were erected in 1900 following the 1900 Hull–Ottawa fire were owned by this company. Bronson also was responsible for the 1891 construction of Generating Station No. 2 at the falls. He, with Gordon B. Pattee (a lumber baron), formed Standard Electric Light Company. (This company was almost certainly actually called Standard Electric Company of Ottawa (Limited), formed in 1891 with Bronson as president, and Pattee as vice-president, which merged with others into the Ottawa Electric Company in 1894). Bronson was later director of the Ottawa Electric Company later absorbed by Ottawa Hydro. He served as Vice President of Ottawa Electric Company, Vice President of Ottawa Light, Heat and Power Company, Limited and President of Upper Ottawa Improvement Company, Limited. He was also president of \"Bronson Company\" and president of the Ottawa Carbide Company. Bronson was also noted as a philanthropist, supporting churches, missions and charities. Bronson retired from business in 1910. He died at Ottawa in 1920. He is buried in Beechwood Cemetery. A street in Ottawa, Bronson Avenue is named after him.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Battel, or battels, sometimes spelled batells, is a term used in the University of Oxford to refer to food ordered by members of the college as distinct from the usual \"commons\". Hence it also referred to college accounts for board and provisions supplied from kitchen and buttery, and, generally, the whole of a person's college accounts. Though the distinction from commons is no longer relevant, the term persists as the name for members' termly bills at many colleges at the Universities of Oxford and Durham. Batteler, later a resident in a college, was originally a rank of students between commoners and servitors who, as the name implies, were not supplied with \"commons\", but only such provisions as they ordered for themselves.

Her academic contributions to the criticism of poetry and poetics, modernismo, memoirs, and the epistolary genre have been recognized both nationally and internationally. As a pioneer of and guiding force for the teaching of language at the University of Maryland, Dr. Nemes is a symbol of the contributions of Latin American women to the intellectual development of the Humanities at Maryland. Dr. Nemes came to the University of Maryland in 1946 where she met Juan Ramón Jiménez. The poet and his wife, Zenobia Camprubí, taught at the University from 1943 to 1951. Jiménez then became Dr. Nemes’ unofficial mentor while she undertook language teaching and pursued her master’s and doctoral degrees. Dr. Nemes finished her dissertation and graduated in 1952 and this marked the beginning of her illustrious career. It was Dr. Nemes who later nominated the poet for the Nobel Prize in literature, which he won in 1956. She became the major critic of Jiménez’s works and has been recognized as such by subsequent generations who have benefited from her early work. The Juan Ramón Jiménez Foundation in Spain counts her as an honorary member. In 2004, a street in Moguer, Jiménez’s birthplace, was named in her honor. On the 50th anniversary of Jimenéz’s Nobel Prize, Dr. Nemes was invited to speak at no less than eight major conferences dedicated to Juan Ramón Jiménez and Zenobia Camprubí. Dr. Nemes delivered opening and closing plenary lectures throughout Spain: in Madrid, Huelva, Seville, and Moguer. She was one of the participants in the Seminar that took place at the Residencia de Estudiantes in Madrid and was interviewed by the media. As recent as last spring, she was also invited to a conference and panel presentation centered on Jiménez and New York that took place at the CUNY Graduate Center in New York City; she will be traveling to Madrid and Moguer once more during the fall for the closing events of the three year long celebrations (2006, 2007, 2008) planned in honor of Juan Ramón Jiménez. One of the prizes in the Hispanic World was awarded to Dr. Nemes in 2006; she was honored with the Great Cross of Alfonso X El Sabio. The Order of Alfonso X El Sabio is an honorary Spanish Order, established by Royal Decree on May 23, 1902 to pay tribute to achievements in the fields of education, science, culture, teaching and research. Dr. Nemes joined a long list of scholars, writers, historian, and scientists who have also received this award, among them Mercedes Salisachs, Laín Entralgo, Joaquín Rodrigo and Antonio Domínguez Ortiz.

In the series, the Confederate States of America defeats the United States in 1862, thereby making good its attempt at secession and becoming an independent nation. Subsequent books are built on imagining events based on this alternate timeline. The secondary name is derived from General Robert E.

Turtledove creates a divergence at September 10, 1862, when three Union soldiers do not find a copy of Special Order 191, as they in fact did historically. Historians believe their find helped General George B. McClellan of the Army of the Potomac prepare for his confrontation with Lee, and contributed to the Union's eventual victory at the Battle of Antietam. The series has sub-series within it.

Hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, and wildfires are among some of the most common natural disasters that possess the capacity for large losses of life and property, with the potential to effectively destroy a university community. Man-made crises also can pose a serious threat to life and property, as was evident in the case of the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting. In order to preemptively reduce or prevent the severity of emergency situations, universities must coordinate and implement policies to effectively eliminate unnecessary risks' and decrease potential losses. Each emergency situation is unique and requires four steps, after an emergency has taken place at a university. Universities, such as East Carolina University, has four different steps when approaching emergency situations. These steps are known as preparedness/mitigation, response, and recovery. Preparedness and mitigation requires each university to be ready at all times for an emergency situation so that everyone remains calm and order can be reestablished as soon as possible. Communication during the response section would be the most important factor. During the response situation, it is important to have an immediate response, in that all help to the emergency situation gets on site as soon a possible to help. The switch from response to recovery is the most important decision of the four steps. This step means the search to help find survivors or even non-survivors is completely over, in which the cleanup and rebuilding process will now begin. Each Step has its own importance and the emergency response process would not work if each step did not cooperate and do its part. This article will examine the threats perceived by American universities and consider the steps these institutions may take to protect their communities from harm.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Yubeh (, also Romanized as Yūbeh; also known as Yūbeh Sa‘dī) is a village in Abshar Rural District, in the Central District of Shadegan County, Khuzestan Province, Iran.

Situated on a plateau, the monastery is well fortified, being surrounded by a thick and high wall. The monastery played an active role in the Cretan resistance of Ottoman rule during the Cretan revolt of 1866. 943 Greeks, mostly women and children, sought refuge in the monastery. After three days of battle and under orders from the hegumen (abbot) of the monastery, the Cretans blew up barrels of gunpowder, choosing to sacrifice themselves rather than surrender.

The voluntary program with incentives was announced by the DOE on 14 February 2008. Through the Builders Challenge, participating homebuilders can more easily differentiate their high energy-performance homes from other less energy-efficient products in the marketplace by means of a standardized energy rating system. “Best energy-performing” is defined by the DOE as scoring 70 or lower on the EnergySmart Home Scale (E-Scale), that is, at least 30 percent more efficient than a typical home built per the 2004 International Energy Conservation Code. The Builders Challenge aims for 1.3 million homes scoring 70 or lower to be constructed by 2030 thereby saving $1.7 billion in energy costs per DOE estimate. \"DOE's ultimate vision is that, by 2030, a consumer will have the opportunity to buy an affordable net zero energy home (NZEH) anywhere in the United States - a grid-connected home that, over the course of a year, produces as much energy as it uses.” The EnergySmart Home Scale provides a visible means of comparing the overall energy-efficiency of homes, analogous to fuel-economy ratings on new motor vehicles or Energy Star ratings on major electrical appliances. Homes that meet or exceed the minimum standards of Builders Challenge receive an E-Scale sunburst sticker, alerting prospective buyers or renters to the home's energy performance.  For example, a 64 on the E-Scale indicates the home is approximately 36 percent more energy efficient than a typical new home built to code. “Builders may place the E-Scale on or near the home's electric panel to show potential homeowners the energy performance achieved by that particular home or model.” Builders can meet the Challenge through any one of three different pathways: performance, prescriptive, or partner/HERS provider. The Builders Challenge Quality Criteria and Technology Information Packets (followed under the prescriptive path) are based on over a decade of Building America’s building science R&D. Both the Builders Challenge and the Building America programs advance the ability to build cost-effective net zero and high performance homes.
