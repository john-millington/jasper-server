It is also an important concept in Indian music, where it means the smallest interval of pitch that the human ear can detect and a singer or musical instrument can produce. The musical sruti concept is found in ancient and medieval Sanskrit texts such as the Natya Shastra, the Dattilam, the Brihaddeshi, and the Sangita Ratnakara. Chandogya Upanishad speaks of the division of the octave in 22 parts. The swara differs from the shruti concept in Indian music. A shruti is the smallest gradation of pitch available, while a swara is the selected pitches from which the musician constructs the scales, melodies and ragas. The Natya Shastra identifies and discusses twenty two shruti and seven swara per octave. Of the twenty two shruti, veena scholars identified the 4th shruti to be sa solfege, 7th to be re, 9th as ga, 13th as ma, 17th as pa, 20th to be dha and 22nd as ni shuddha swara. Theoretically, an infinite number of shruti are possible, and later music scholars of India increased the number of sruti in their studies. It has been used in several contexts throughout the history of Indian music. Recent research has more precisely defined the term shruti, its difference from nada and swara, and pinpointed positions on a string to play 22 shrutis. The most well-known example of shrutis is probably the use of the ati-komal (extra flat) gandhar in raga Darbari. Others include the rishabh in Bhairav, the nishad in Bhimpalasi and Miya Malhar, and the gandhar in Todi.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"WBMA-LD, virtual channel 58 (UHF digital channel 40), is an ABC-affiliated television station licensed to Birmingham, Alabama, United States.

However, Sinclair effectively owns WDBB as the majority of Cunningham's stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith. WBMA-LD maintains studio facilities located at the Riverchase office park on Concourse Parkway in Hoover (though the station's mailing address says Birmingham), and its transmitter is located atop Red Mountain (near the Tarpley City neighborhood) in southwestern Birmingham.

For the most part, it was a time of plenitude, peace and happiness for Elves and Men. The Long Peace lasted hundreds of years, during which time Men arrived over the Blue Mountains and the skill and prowess of the Noldor reached its peak. Fingolfin and Fingon kept watch from Hithlum; Finrod and Orodreth from Tol Sirion; Angrod and Aegnor from Dorthonion; and the sons of Fëanor from the eastern marches. The siege was incomplete, as Morgoth was still capable of sending out forces through secret passages from the towers of Thangorodrim to harass the Elves and to spy out Beleriand. In one of these attacks, the first dragon, Glaurung, attacked. Immediately, the greater part of the Elven forces were driven back, and Lake Helevorn was defiled. However, the dragon was not yet fully grown, and his armour was still vulnerable. Fingon, leading a force of horse-borne archers, was able to drive the dragon back to Angband, winning great praise. Afterwards, the Noldor grew strong, and sorties from Angband posed no significant threat. However, the Noldor and their allies possessed insufficient force to assault Angband directly. After nearly four hundred years, the siege was broken and the age of peace ended in the Dagor Bragollach (Battle of Sudden Flame); an onslaught of fire and ash Morgoth issued from Thangorodrim, providing cover for his advancing forces.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Mozilla Mail & Newsgroups (also referred to as Mozilla Mail/News or simply Mozilla Mail) was an e-mail and news client that was part of the Mozilla Application Suite.

Born in Cottesbrooke, a small Northamptonshire village, Wilson was the oldest of three cricketing brothers, each of whom played for Suffolk in the Minor Counties Championship. The youngest brother, Herbert Wilson, went on to play for (and briefly captain) Sussex, playing more than 100 matches over eleven seasons at the club. The three brothers played together on numerous occasions, from the 1908 season through to the 1910 season. Francis Wilson was the last brother to debut for Suffolk, but on his debut against Norfolk in June 1908, which marked the first time the three brothers appeared together, he scored 183 runs. His last recorded appearance for Suffolk was a single match in August 1911, against Norfolk. By this time, he had made his first-class debut, playing for a combined Army and Navy side against a Combined Universities team. Despite his earlier century for Suffolk, Wilson achieved more success as a bowler at higher levels. Bowling leg breaks, he took eight wickets on his first-class debut, which included a five-wicket haul, 5/60, in the second innings. Wilson's next two first-class matches came in the 1913 and 1914 seasons, in the inter-services Army vs Navy games. He captained the Army to a 170-run victory in the June 1914 fixture, and was subsequently selected for the MCC in a match against Cambridge University the following month, played at Lord's. Wilson's fifth and final first-class match came in the Army–Navy fixture during the 1920 season, after the conclusion of the First World War.

The next two regional tournaments, in 2006 and 2010, served as part of the qualification process for the Women's World Cup. All matches prior to 2011 were played in the 50-over format (as used in One Day Internationals), but since then, the Twenty20 format has been used, with the tournament played annually. The winners in even-numbered years (so far, 2012 and 2014) proceed to a qualification tournament for the Women's World Twenty20. Only three teams have participated in every edition of the tournament – Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. South Africa, a full member of the ICC, has participated only once, in 2010, when a poor result at the 2009 World Cup meant they had to re-qualify through regional competitions. However, South African invitational teams have participated in every edition since 2011, winning each time.

In 2006, under Thompson's leadership, Wachovia acquired GoldenWest for approximately $26 billion, at the peak of the real estate market. In 2010, Wachovia settled out of court a case in which it allegedly laundered over $378 billion in cash and traveler's checks from Mexican drug cartels in the years 2004 - 2006, during Thompson's tenure as CEO.

He was the youngest of four sons of Landulf I, gastald of Capua. As a young man, he entered the church. When his father died, his eldest brother, Lando, succeeded him. On the death of the bishop of Capua, Paulinus, Lando made Landulf bishop of the city. Lando died in 861 and his young son, Lando II was deposed only a few months later by Landulf's other elder brother, Pando. Pando too died soon thereafter (862 or 863) and a succession crisis broke out. Pando's son Pandenulf was shoved aside and Landulf, though bishop, took the Capuan throne in 863. However, the other branches of the family refused to recognize the usurpation and began seizing much of the county for themselves, leaving Landulf II only in control of the town of Capua proper. Isolated, Landulf II invited Saracen mercenaries to ravage the lands of his familiars, a move which much alarmed his neighbors (including the pope). In 866, the deposed Pandenulf appealed to Emperor Louis II, then visiting Monte Cassino, to act against his uncle. The Emperor promptly besieged Capua and divested Landulf II, but instead of restoring Pandenulf, decided to pass the county of Capua over to the marquis Lambert I of Spoleto. This arrangement did not last long. In 871, Lambert was involved in a rebellion against Louis II orchestrated by Adelchis of Benevento. In the aftermath, Louis II deposed Lambert and restored Landulf II as count of Capua. As a condition, Landulf II swore off deploying Saracens in the county. Upon the death of Louis (875), who had strictly enforced peace amongst the Christians of the Mezzogiorno, Landulf II allied himself with the Saracens, but in 877, Pope John VIII convinced him to ally himself to the papacy against the Muslims. He spent the next years defending the Amalfi Coast with his navy in return for tribute. Landulf II died in 879, undisputed count of Capua, and a succession crisis broke out again between his nephews Lando II (son of Lando), Pandenulf (son of Pando) and Lando III (son of Landenulf of Teano). In the chronicle of Erchempert, of whom he was a contemporary, Landulf II of Capua is the chief villain, portrayed as a dabbler in mysticism and black magic, Saracen ally and enemy of Christendom. Erchempert's portrayal of Landulf II was the inspiration for the character of evil duke and magician Klingsor in Wolfram von Eschenbach's medieval epic Parzival. Eschenbach's epic was later translated into the famous nineteenth-century opera Parsifal by Richard Wagner. As American film director George Lucas is frequently said to have looked to Parsifal for inspiration in his creation of the Star Wars saga, Landulf II of Capua, via this long chain of association, is the closest historical source for the villainous Darth Vader.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Bhoothath Azhwar (also spelt Bhoothathalvar or Bhoothath Alvar) is one of the twelve azhwar saints of South India, who are known for their affiliation to Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism.

Bhoothath composed hundred verses that are classified as Irandam Tiruvandadhi and his composition is set in the Andhadhi style in which the ending syllable is the starting one for the next verse. As per Hindu legend, Bhoothath was found in a liquorice flower in Thirukadalmallai (modern-day Mahabalipuram.

They found out that it was god Vishnu and Poigai wished to see his face continuously but could view only from the simmering light of the lightning. With a view to maintain the continuity of light, Poigai instantly composed hundred songs wishing light to emerge. Pey and Bhoothath continued composing hundred songs each on Vishnu. The works of these earliest saints contributed to the philosophical and theological ideas of Vaishnavism.

It is developed for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution, and is closely integrated with Debian's package management system, dpkg. When packages are being installed, debconf asks the user questions which determine the contents of the system-wide configuration files associated with that package. After package installation, it is possible to go back and change the configuration of a package by using the  program, or another program such as Synaptic. The design of debconf allows for front-ends for answering configuration questions to be added in a modular way, and there exist several, such as one for dialog, one for readline, one that uses a text editor, one for KDE, one for GNOME, a Python front-end API, etc.The original implementation of debconf is in Perl. During the development of Debian-Installer, a new implementation in C was developed, which is named cdebconf. The new implementation is currently only used in the installer, but is intended to eventually replace the original entirely. Both implementations make use of the same protocol for communication between the debconf front-end and the client code (\"confmodule\"); this is a simple line-based protocol similar to common Internet protocols. Debconf does not physically configure any packages, but asks the user certain configuration questions stored in the .templates file, under the direction of the package's maintainer scripts (.config, .postinst, etc.). Typically, the .config script uses debconf to ask questions, while .postinst applies configuration changes to the unpacked package in reaction to the answers; however, this can vary due to technical requirements. The user's answers to the configuration questions asked by debconf are cached in debconf's database.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Equality before the law, also known as: equality under the law, equality in the eyes of the law, or legal equality, is the principle that each independent human being must be treated equally by the law (principle of isonomy) and that all people are subject to the same laws of justice (due process). Therefore, the law must guarantee that no individual nor group of individuals should be privileged or discriminated against by the government. Equality before the law is one of the basic principles of liberalism. This principle arises from various important and complex questions concerning equality, fairness, and justice. In 1894, the author Anatole France said that \"[i]n its majestic equality, the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets, and steal loaves of bread.\" The belief in equality before the law is called legal egalitarianism. The principle of equality before the law is incompatible and ceases to exist with legal systems such as slavery, servitude, colonialism, monarchy, or quotaism . Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) states that \"All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law.\" Thus, everyone must be treated equally under the law regardless of race, gender, national origin, color, ethnicity, religion, disability, or other characteristics, without privilege, discrimination or bias. The general guarantee of equality is provided by most of the world's national constitutions, but specific implementations of this guarantee vary. For example, while many constitutions guarantee equality regardless of race, only a few mention the right to equality regardless of nationality.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Sue Channel Provincial Park is a provincial park in British Columbia, Canada.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Songs in the Key of Beotch, released in 2000, is the second album released by That 1 Guy, via Righteous Babe Records.

Reason maintenance distinguishes between base facts, which can be defeated, and derived facts. As such it differs from belief revision which, in its basic form, assumes that all facts are equally important. Reason maintenance was originally developed as a technique for implementing problem solvers. It encompasses a variety of techniques that share a common architecture: two components—a reasoner and a reason maintenance system—communicate with each other via an interface. The reasoner uses the reason maintenance system to record its inferences and justifications of (\"reasons\" for) the inferences. The reasoner also informs the reason maintenance system which are the currently valid base facts (assumptions). The reason maintenance system uses the information to compute the truth value of the stored derived facts and to restore consistency if an inconsistency is derived. A truth maintenance system, or TMS, is a knowledge representation method for representing both beliefs and their dependencies and an algorithm called the \"truth maintenance algorithm\" that manipulates and maintains the dependencies. The name truth maintenance is due to the ability of these systems to restore consistency. A truth maintenance system maintains consistency between old believed knowledge and current believed knowledge in the knowledge base (KB) through revision. If the current believed statements contradict the knowledge in the KB, then the KB is updated with the new knowledge. It may happen that the same data will again be believed, and the previous knowledge will be required in the KB. If the previous data are not present, but may be required for new inference. But if the previous knowledge was in the KB, then no retracing of the same knowledge is needed. The use of TMS avoids such retracing; it keeps track of the contradictory data with the help of a dependency record. This record reflects the retractions and additions which makes the inference engine (IE) aware of its current belief set. Each statement having at least one valid justification is made a part of the current belief set. When a contradiction is found, the statement(s) responsible for the contradiction are identified and the records are appropriately updated. This process is called dependency-directed backtracking. The TMS algorithm maintains the records in the form of a dependency network. Each node in the network is an entry in the KB (a premise, antecedent, or inference rule etc.) Each arc of the network represent the inference steps through which the node was derived. A premise is a fundamental belief which is assumed to be true. They do not need justifications. The set of premises are the basis from which justifications for all other nodes will be derived. There are two types of justification for a node. They are:","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Assam tea is a black tea named after the region of its production, Assam, in India. It is also traditionally used in Yunnan province in China. Assam tea is manufactured specifically from the plant Camellia sinensis var. assamica (Masters). This tea, most of which is grown at or near sea level, is known for its body, briskness, malty flavour, and strong, bright colour. Assam teas, or blends containing Assam, are often sold as \"breakfast\" teas. For instance, Irish breakfast tea, a maltier and stronger breakfast tea, consists of small-sized Assam tea leaves. The state of Assam is the world's largest tea-growing region, lying on either side of the Brahmaputra River, and bordering Bangladesh and Myanmar. This part of India experiences high precipitation; during the monsoon period, as much as 10 to 12 inches (250–300 mm) of rain per day. The daytime temperature rises to about 96.8F (36 °C), creating greenhouse-like conditions of extreme humidity and heat. This tropical climate contributes to Assam's unique malty taste, a feature for which this tea is well known.

The triad was first proposed by psychiatrist J.M. Macdonald in \"The Threat to Kill\", a 1963 paper in the American Journal of Psychiatry. Small-scale studies conducted by psychiatrists Daniel Hellman and Nathan Blackman, and then FBI agents John E. Douglas and Robert K. Ressler along with Dr. Ann Burgess, claimed substantial evidence for the association of these childhood patterns with later predatory behavior. Although it remains an influential and widely taught theory, subsequent research has generally not validated this line of thinking. The triad links cruelty to animals, obsession with fire-setting, and persistent bedwetting past a certain age, to violent behaviors, particularly homicidal behavior and sexually predatory behavior. However, other studies claim to have not found statistically significant links between the triad and violent offenders. Further studies have suggested that these behaviors are actually more linked to childhood experience of parental neglect, brutality or abuse. Some argue this in turn results in \"homicidal proneness\". The \"triad\" concept as a particular combination of behaviors linked to violence may not have any particular validity – it has been called an urban legend.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Marshfield is an extinct town in Vienna Township, Scott County, in the U.S. state of Indiana, about three miles northwest of Scottsburg.

This yield usually varies over time with the needs of the ecosystem to maintain itself, e.g. a forest that has recently suffered a blight or flooding or fire will require more of its own ecological yield to sustain and re-establish a mature forest. While doing so, the sustainable yield may be much less. In forestry terms it is the largest amount of harvest activity that can occur without degrading the productivity of the stock. This concept is important in fishery management, in which sustainable yield is defined as the number of fish that can be extracted without reducing the base of fish stock, and the maximum sustainable yield is defined as the amount of fish that can be extracted under given environmental conditions. In fisheries, the basic natural capital or virgin population, must decrease with extraction. At the same time productivity increases. Hence, sustainable yield would be within the range in which the natural capital together with its production are able to provide satisfactory yield. It may be very difficult to quantify sustainable yield, because every dynamic ecological conditions and other factors not  related to harvesting induce changes and fluctuations in both, the natural capital and its productivity. In the case of groundwater there is a safe yield of water extraction per unit time, beyond which the aquifer risks the state of overdrafting or even depletion.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Mainline Freight was a trainload rail freight operator based in Islington, London, England with operations extending to Yorkshire in the north and Somerset in the west.

Also called the Third District, it encompassed the southwestern one-third of the nation. The Pushmataha District was named in honor of Pushmataha, a revered Choctaw warrior and statesman who was chief of Okla Hannali, the Six Towns District, one of the three historic, major clan divisions of the Choctaw in the Southeast. The other two districts were the Apukshunnubbee District and Moshulatubbee District. The districts were established when the Choctaw Nation relocated via the Trail of Tears to the Indian Territory—present-day Oklahoma—and were originally intended to provide homes for settlers from the three major clans or groupings of Choctaw Indians comprising the nation. But, the clan affiliations and allegiances rapidly became less important after the Choctaws’ arrival in the Indian Territory. The districts’ importance in the political life of the nation waned, over time, and the three district chiefs lost power and authority to the principal chief of the nation. Eventually the principal chief became, in simply, the chief. No longer a “first among equals”, he became the sole political leader. In judicial affairs, however, the three districts and their seats of government retained their historic influence. Crimes and criminals not tried at the county level were bucked to the district level automatically, and court days were the busiest days of the year in the district seats of government. Pushmataha District’s final and most important administrative seat of government was Mayhew, Indian Territory, a former Presbyterian missionary station two miles north of the present-day Boswell, Oklahoma. Mayhew was its last seat of district government—the first had been established at Tiak Heli, a site one half-mile east of present-day Sunkist, Oklahoma (in southeastern Atoka County), “between the forks of the Boggy” (“or Boggies”), as it was called. The site was difficult to reach, being situated between the Clear Boggy Creek and Muddy Boggy Creekactually small rivers—and few ferries operated on the rivers to provide convenient crossings. When the court house at Tiak Heli burned in the last part of the 19th Century the administrative center moved to Mayhew. “I never understood why court was held in the forks of the Boggy, forcing everyone who attended to cross a river,” mused one early-day settler decades later. He assumed the district seat of government had been selected due to being located in the center of general population, which was likely true. “There were no ferries, nor bridges above the forks of the Boggy,” he recalled, referring to the Clear Boggy Creek and Muddy Boggy Creek as a single waterway. Another settler recalled the post oak tree used as the “whipping tree”. The Choctaw district courts meted out whippings as punishment. As of 1937, the tree was still in existence. Included in the Pushmataha District were the Choctaw Nation counties of Atoka, Jack's Fork, Blue, Jackson, and Kiamitia (Kiamichi). As Oklahoma’s statehood loomed, the Pushmataha District, and its constituent counties, slowly wound down their governmental functions as the United States Courts in the Indian Territory assumed their powers. On November 16, 1907—Oklahoma’s Statehood Day—the district and its counties disappeared forever. The territory of the former Pushmataha District is incorporated into the present-day Oklahoma counties of Atoka, Bryan, Choctaw, and Pushmataha.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Donji Rinj is a village in the municipality of Bela Palanka, Serbia.
