Robert Clay was educated at Bedford School and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. Unusually for a man of his background, Clay went on to become a bus driver, working for Tyne and Wear PTE from 1975 to 1983. Clay first joined Labour as a teenager, but left to join the Trotskyist group International Socialists. He became a union shop steward in the 1980s and rejoined Labour. Clay was first elected to Parliament in 1983 for the Sunderland North constituency, replacing Labour MP Frederick Willey, was re-elected in 1987, but stood down at the 1992 general election, where Labour MP William Etherington was elected in his place. Clay opposed the 2003 Iraq War. He backed the left-wing party RESPECT The Unity Coalition in the 2004 European Elections. At the 2005 general election, he acted as agent for Reg Keys, who stood against the Prime Minister Tony Blair in Blair's Sedgefield constituency on an anti-war ticket. Keys' son Tom had been killed in action in Iraq. Although Clay was not an originator of Keys' campaign he used his position as agent to control all aspects of the campaign. He persuaded Derek Cattell, a former trade union officer and an executive member of Blair's Sedgefield Labour Party to join the campaign. Cattell's resignation from Labour during the election campaign, produced much publicity for the Keys campaign. Clay worked tirelessly for the Keys campaign helping build a coalition of support for Keys. Supporters included the former MP Martin Bell who in his book, The Truth that Sticks (2007) wrote \"Of great value was Derek Cattell, formerly on the executive of Sedgefield Labour Party. He defected to Reg's campaign after some heart searching; it cost him some fair weather friends, but the candidate had no loyal supporter from start to finish.\" (page 103) Clay went on to live in the Marches city of Hereford and remains politically active as a volunteer official in the local Labour Party. He has involved himself in a number of local causes including a group opposed to the building of a by-pass which would disturb ancient archaeological remains known as The Dinedor Serpent. He now lives in the Llansamlet ward of Swansea East, where on 4 July 2013 he was elected, in a by election, as a Labour Party councillor for the City and County of Swansea Council.

After the United States entered the war on 1 January 1942, this vital link was attacked by German submarines in the Operation Paukenschlag, threatening both the oil supplies to the north-east and its onward transshipment to Great Britain. The Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes, championed the pipeline project as a way of transporting petroleum by the more-secure, interior route. The pipelines were government financed and owned, but were built and operated by the War Emergency Pipelines company, a non-profit corporation backed by a consortium of the largest American oil companies. It was the longest, biggest and heaviest project of its type then undertaken; the Big and Little Big Inch pipelines were long respectively, with 35 pumping stations along their routes. The project required 16,000 people and of materials. It was praised as an example of private-public sector cooperation and featured extensively in US government propaganda. After the end of the war there were extended arguments over how the pipelines should be used. In 1947, the Texas East Transmission Corporation purchased the pipelines for $143,127,000, the largest post-war disposal of war-surplus property.

A famous example is a 1979 cover of BusinessWeek titled \"The Death of Equities\". The '70s had been a generally bad decade for the stock market and at the time the article was written the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 800. However, 1979 roughly marked a turning point, and stocks went on to enjoy a bull market for the better part of two decades. Even after the financial crisis of 2007–2010, stocks remain far above their 1979 levels. Using the Magazine Cover Indicator, Business Week's projection that equities were dead should have been a buy signal. By the time an idea has had time to make its way to the business press, particularly a trading idea, then the idea has likely run its course. Similarly, good news on a cover can be taken as an ill omen. As Paul Krugman has joked, \"Whom the Gods would destroy, they first put on the cover of Business Week.\" Although there are a number of examples where magazines have been wrong, even spectacularly wrong, there is a tendency to ignore all the times the covers are right. In January 2008, for example, Business Week ran a cover story entitled \"Meltdown; For Housing the Worst Is Yet To Come\" and in July 2008 a cover story called \"The Home Price Abyss; Why the threat of a free fall is growing\" and indeed, for the rest of 2008 and into 2009 home prices continued to plummet. An investor who interpreted the magazine covers as a contrary indicator and purchased real estate would have lost much of his investment. In 2016, Gregory Marks and Brent Donnelly of Citigroup looked at The Economist and \"selected 44 cover images from between 1998 and 2016 that seemed to make an optimistic or pessimistic point.\" They found that impactful covers with a strong visual bias tended to be contrarian 68% of the time after 1 year. The latest example of this phenomenon being The Economist's Living in a low rate world from September 2016, weeks before one of the fastest selloffs in global fixed income.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Rah Rah is an indie rock musical group formed in 2006 in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.

It involves the study of both the genetic and environmental mechanisms that underlie the development of social and cognitive competencies, as well as the epigenetic (gene-environment interactions) processes that adapt these competencies to local conditions. EDP considers both the reliably developing, species-typical features of ontogeny (developmental adaptations), as well as individual differences in behavior, from an evolutionary perspective. While evolutionary views tend to regard most individual differences as the result of either random genetic noise (evolutionary byproducts) and/or idiosyncrasies (for example, peer groups, education, neighborhoods, and chance encounters) rather than products of natural selection, EDP asserts that natural selection can favor the emergence of individual differences via \"adaptive developmental plasticity.\" From this perspective, human development follows alternative life-history strategies in response to environmental variability, rather than following one species-typical pattern of development. EDP is closely linked to the theoretical framework of evolutionary psychology (EP), but is also distinct from EP in several domains, including research emphasis (EDP focuses on adaptations of ontogeny, as opposed to adaptations of adulthood) and consideration of proximate ontogenetic and environmental factors (i.e., how development happens) in addition to more ultimate factors (i.e., why development happens), which are the focus of mainstream evolutionary psychology. <section end=Lead />","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Skelton-in-Cleveland is a small town in the civil parish of Skelton and Brotton in North Yorkshire, England.

Gillhof was born in Glaisin in Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He followed in his father's profession as a teacher. He graduated in 1881 from a teaching school and later passed the teaching examination in Schwerin. After becoming a teacher Gillhoff would begin collecting colloquial expressions used by locals, starting as early as 1888. Gillhoff collected about 4,000 Low German expressions, speech patterns and proverbs and published them in a report. In 1892 Gillhoff would also have published a work called Mecklenburgischen Volksrätseln (roughly translated \"Mecklenburg folk riddles\"). The book unites 931 riddles, plus variants, that Gillhoff subdivided into subject areas. This work by Gillhoff was overshadowed in 1897 by a similar work by Richard Wossidlo. Gillhoff's most well-known work, Jürnjakob Swehn der Amerikafahrer, roughly translated into English as \"Jürnjakob Swehn, the Traveler to America\", was published in 1917. Gillhoff retired from teaching in 1924, but would go on to have published the work called Mecklenburgischen Monatshefte (\"Mecklenburg monthly notes\"). Gillhoff died in the town of Parchim. Jürnjakob Swehn der Amerikafahrer is considered Gillhoff's most important work. The book is about a single individual (Jürnjakob Swehn) who had emigrated to the United States in 1868, and details his experiences there in the form of letters sent back to his old school teacher in Mecklenburg. Jürnjakob would travel to Iowa and become a farm hand, and would later marry and gain his own farm and a modest amount of wealth. The book also detailed the establishment of a local German speaking church, their acquiring of a pastor, and the preaching of lay preachers before the arrival of the pastor. Gillhoff's book also discussed the beginnings of a German-speaking school in Jürnjakob Swehn's small community and his homesickness for his \"old Mecklenburg\". The style of writing is rough and colloquial, such as would be found in personal correspondence, and the story line contains great degree of spontaneity, with many Mecklenburg proverbs thrown in, mostly in the Low German style. The main character is portrayed as an honest, hard working and modest man with a simple lifestyle. Elements of humor are interspersed throughout the book. The book, which was said to have an earthy charm, enjoyed some success in Germany around the time of its release, with over a million sold. In the year 2000 the book was translated into English and published in the United States, through the help of the University of Iowa. The book was often thought of as fiction, but in actuality it was an amalgam of real letters, detailing real experiences of multiple German (Mecklenburger) immigrants to America. These letters were written by former students of Gillhoff's father, and sent to him over the years. Insights about the experiences these people had, and the life they had lived in Mecklenburg can offer the reader some sharp insights. There are some suggestions that the book was solely or largely based on the experiences of one man named Carl Wiedow who left Glaisin for America in 1868 and died in Iowa in 1913. There is a small museum in Glaisin honoring the work of Gilhoff, and displaying artifacts surrounding the man and the letters that were sent to him.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Charlie Nearburg (born September 6, 1950) is a race car driver who broke the wheel-driven land speed record in 2010.

He used his profits from his successful business to finance his auto racing career, becoming a long time Toyota Atlantic competitor. In 1997 he drove in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in a Ferrari 333 SP for Pilot Motorsports and funded three appearances in the CART Champ Car series for Dale Coyne Racing. Coyne is particularly proud of the progress Nearburg made while with the team, stating in a 2004 interview: “Charlie Nearburg is an example I love – he was a guy that was older, he was married, he had kids and always wanted to do these races. So he came with us, and did three races, and we pushed him a little bit, but by the time he got to his third race, he was very respectable – and he’s got that to carry with him the rest of his life.” Nearburg retired from professional racing after his Champ Car experience. He is listed as a Ferrari 250 GTO owner. In September 2010 driving the Spirit of Rett, Nearburg broke Goldenrod's wheel-driven land speed record at a speed of 414.4 mph at the Bonneville Salt Flats using a General Motors racing V-8 engine.

Natural arches commonly form where inland cliffs, coastal cliffs, fins or stacks are subject to erosion from the sea, rivers or weathering (subaerial processes). Most natural arches are formed from narrow fins and sea stacks composed of sandstone or limestone with steep, often vertical, cliff faces. The formations become narrower due to erosion over geologic time scales. The softer rock stratum erodes away creating rock shelters, or alcoves, on opposite sides of the formation beneath the relatively harder stratum, or caprock, above it. The alcoves erode further into the formation eventually meeting underneath the harder caprock layer, thus creating an arch. The erosional processes exploit weaknesses in the softer rock layers making cracks larger and removing material more quickly than the caprock; however, the caprock itself continues to erode after an arch has formed, which will ultimately lead to collapse. The choice between bridge and arch is somewhat arbitrary. The Natural Arch and Bridge Society identifies a bridge as a subtype of arch that is primarily water-formed. By contrast, the Dictionary of Geological Terms defines a natural bridge as a \"natural arch that spans a valley of erosion.\" The largest natural arch, by a significant margin, is the Xianren Bridge in China, with a span of .","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Tupeni Lebaivalu Baba is a Fijian academic and politician, who founded the now-defunct New Labour Unity Party.

It may be that Athena Itonia had something of the character which in her primitive worship she had at Athens, and that she was a goddess who fostered the growths of the earth and who therefore had some affinity to the Chthonic deities. In Iton there was a celebrated sanctuary and festivals for this cult, and is hence also called incola Itoni (\"resident of Iton\"). From Iton her worship spread into Boeotia, where she was the chief deity of war, and the country about Lake Copais. In her temple between Pherae and Larissa were hung the shields won from the Gauls in the last victory of Greece over barbarism, although a fragment from Bacchylides indicates that Athena Itonia was not only a war goddess, but a goddess of the arts of peace, especially poetry. The temple of Athena Itonia in Coronea was the meeting-place of the Panboeotian Confederacy, and where the Pamboeotia was celebrated, in the neighborhood of a grove of Athena.

Smith (1905–1987),  is a graphical aid or nomogram designed for electrical and electronics engineers specializing in radio frequency (RF) engineering to assist in solving problems with transmission lines and matching circuits.

The Smith chart is most frequently used at or within the unity radius region. However, the remainder is still mathematically relevant, being used, for example, in oscillator design and stability analysis. While the use of paper Smith charts for solving the complex mathematics involved in matching problems has been largely replaced by software based methods, the Smith chart display is still the preferred method of displaying how RF parameters behave at one or more frequencies, an alternative to using tabular information. Thus most RF circuit analysis software includes a Smith chart option for the display of results and all but the simplest impedance measuring instruments can display measured results on a Smith chart display.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Wolsztyn  () is a town in western Poland, on the western edge of Greater Poland Voivodeship (from 1975 to 1998 it was in Zielona Góra Voivodeship).

Green's functions and scattering matrix are the fundamental objects in quantum field theory which determine basic physically measurable quantities. Formal expressions for Green's functions and S-matrix in any physical quantum field theory contain divergent integrals (i.e., integrals which take infinite values) and therefore formally these expressions are meaningless. The renormalization procedure is a specific procedure to make these divergent integrals finite and obtain (and predict) finite values for physically measurable quantities. The Bogoliubov–Parasyuk theorem states that for a wide class of quantum field theories, called renormalizable field theories, these divergent integrals can be made finite in a regular way using a finite (and small) set of certain elementary subtractions of divergencies. The theorem guarantees that computed within the pertrubation expansion Green's functions and matrix elements of the scattering matrix are finite for any renormalized quantum field theory. The theorem specifies a concrete procedure (the Bogoliubov–Parasyuk R-operation) for subtraction of divergencies in any order of pertrubation theory, establishes correctness of this procedure, and guarantees the uniqueness of the obtained results. The theorem was proved by Nikolay Bogoliubov and Ostap Parasyuk in 1955.
