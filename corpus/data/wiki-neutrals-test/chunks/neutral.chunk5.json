Slaveykov Square is famous for its many book stalls. A square called Kafene Başi is first mentioned to have existed at the modern place in 1515. A coffeehouse, a mosque and two Turkish police stations were situated there. In the 17th century, the square was an important crossroad stretching from modern Sveta Nedelya Square to Vitosha Boulevard and featured a fountain. After the liberation of Bulgaria, the square was extended, and many one- and two-story houses with gardens were erected on the site, one of which belonged to Petko Slaveykov, whose name the square later took. During the 1920s and 1930s, Slaveykov Square formed its modern appearance, with five- to seven-storey buildings featuring a shop on the ground floor. The first significant constructions appeared in this period — the Teachers' Fund (1924). the Ministry of Public Works (1928), and the French Institute (1934). After 1944, the automobile traffic around the square was gradually limited, and it turned into a pedestrian area. In the years following 1990, the square became a preferred place for booksellers, and many bookshops emerged on it. This is probably because the Sofia City Library is at the square.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Mile Mrkšić (; 1 May 1947 – 16 August 2015) was a Colonel of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) in charge of the unit involved in the Battle of Vukovar during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991.

This temple on the sea shore is a sought after pilgrim centre for both people of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The Kodai festival at Mondaicaudu is a major celebration in the region and as in Sabarimala people flock here, especially women. To accommodate the large populations special buses run between Nagercoil and nearby towns at the time, there are also chain services operated from Thiruvananthapuram.

One can see meat being cooked during the Ponkala days around the temple. There is a folk history that Velu Thampi, a minister of Travancore, took over the temple from a local Nayar Tharavadu at Colachel, after a tussle, and the then Karanavar cursed him and killed himself, later Velu Thampi himself driven to the same fate after his fights with the British.

Such radars are a subclass of the wider class of target acquisition radars. Early counter-battery radars were generally used against mortars, whose lofted trajectories were highly symmetrical and allowed easy calculation of the launcher's location. Starting in the 1970s, digital computers with improved calculation capabilities allowed more complex trajectories of long-range artillery to also be determined. Normally these radars would be attached to friendly artillery units or their support units, allowing them to quickly arrange counter-battery fire. With the aid of modern communications systems, the information from a single radar can be rapidly disseminated over long distances. This allows the radar to notify multiple batteries as well as provide early warning to the friendly targets. Modern counter-battery radar can locate hostile batteries up to about 50 km away depending on the radar's capabilities and the terrain and weather. Some counter-battery radars can also be used to track the fire of friendly artillery and calculate corrections to adjust its fire onto a particular place, but this is usually a secondary mission objective. Radar is the most recently developed means of locating hostile artillery. The emergence of indirect fire in World War I saw the development of sound ranging, flash spotting and air reconnaissance, both visual and photographic. Radars, like sound ranging and flash spotting, require hostile guns, etc., to fire before they can be located.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Hibiscus tiliaceus is a species of flowering tree in the mallow family, Malvaceae, that is native to the Old World tropics.

It was the first ever commercially produced hard drive in a 1.3 inch form factor. The original implementation (model 3013) had the capacity of 20 MB. A 40 MB model called Kittyhawk II (model 3014) was eventually introduced, with the retail price of $499. Both models have IDE interfaces. It appears that some variations of the hard drive were produced with PC card interface as well. The drive measured 2.0\" x 1.44\" x 0.414\" (50.8 mm x 36.5 mm x 10.5 mm), and weighed about 1 ounce (28 g). It was manufactured by Citizen Corporation, at the time a leader in small device manufacturing. The drive featured a number of unique technologies, including a built-in accelerometer that protected the hard drive from falls. Kittyhawk was claimed to be able to survive a 3-foot drop onto concrete while operating without loss of data.Despite its remarkable characteristics, Kittyhawk turned out to be a commercial failure. It was not in demand from notebook industry due to its inferior cost per megabyte and capacity. A few OEM suppliers adopted the drive, including an early pen based computer maker EO, which ran the GO operating system. The handheld market failed to take off in early 1990s as expected. Many potential markets, such as the video game console market, were missed due to hard drive's high production costs. Kittyhawk was discontinued by HP in September 1994. Approximately 160,000 units were actually sold compared to projected 2-year sales of 700,000 units. In 1996, largely due to Kittyhawk's failure, Hewlett Packard closed its Disk Memory Division and exited the disk drive business.

Hughes and is given the chemical symbol Mu. During the muon's lifetime, muonium can enter into compounds such as muonium chloride (MuCl) or sodium muonide (NaMu). Due to the mass difference between the antimuon and the electron, muonium () is more similar to atomic hydrogen () than positronium (). Its Bohr radius and ionization energy are within 0.5% of hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium, and thus it can usefully be considered as an exotic light isotope of hydrogen. Although muonium is short-lived, physical chemists study it using muon spin spectroscopy (μSR), a magnetic resonance technique analogous to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Like ESR, μSR is useful for the analysis of chemical transformations and the structure of compounds with novel or potentially valuable electronic properties. Muonium is usually studied by muon spin rotation, in which the Mu atom's spin precesses in a magnetic field applied transverse to the muon spin direction (since muons are typically produced in a spin-polarized state from the decay of pions), and by avoided level crossing (ALC), which is also called level crossing resonance (LCR). The latter employs a magnetic field applied longitudinally to the polarization direction, and monitors the relaxation of muon spins caused by \"flip/flop\" transitions with other magnetic nuclei. Because the muon is a lepton, the atomic energy levels of muonium can be calculated with great precision from quantum electrodynamics (QED), unlike in the case of hydrogen, where the precision is limited by uncertainties related to the internal structure of the proton. For this reason, muonium is an ideal system for studying bound-state QED and also for searching for physics beyond the standard model.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Brunswick Cathedral (, lit. in ) is a large Lutheran church in the City of Braunschweig (Brunswick), Germany.

On his death in 1894 he was succeeded in the marquessate, and his other titles, by his uncle. According to family records, he went by the name William, and was known informally as Willie. (Wardens, page 310 as \"dear Willie\". Wardens, page 312 as \"poor, unfortunate Willie\", cited from 3rd Marquess Ailesbury's diary.) In his youth, he attended Eton, but got into trouble, and left the school \"under a cloud.\" (Wardens, page 310.) He became a habitual gambler, forcing his grandfather to step in and pay hundreds of thousands of pounds to satisfy his creditors. In the process of paying off certain creditors, the 3rd Marquess was forced to sell the family's Yorkshire properties to raise the more than 175,000 GBP of debt Willie had amassed. (Wardens, page 313.) Upon succeeding his grandfather in the family estates, Willie's propensity for gambling only increased, and he soon found his entire estate approaching bankruptcy, amassing another huge round of debts exceeding 230,000 GBP. (Wardens, page 318) During the legal proceedings in 1891, many offers were made to buy the great Savernake estates, including one by Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh, then Chairman of the Board and former CEO of the Guinness Company. (Wardens, page 319.) However, the Board of Trustees of Savernake, headed by Ailesbury's uncle, Lord Henry Brudenell-Bruce, fought hard to prevent Ailesbury from selling. (Wardens, page 321.) After years of legal battles and appeals, Edward Guinness, by then known as Lord Iveagh, became impatient and withdrew his offer, after a 1 May 1893 deadline was not met. (Wardens, page 327.) Not long after that, Ailesbury suffered an untimely death, brought about by a sudden illness, and due mainly to his excessive lifestyle. (Wardens, page 330.) He was succeeded by his uncle, who therefore had the very difficult task of making the estate solvent once more. The April 1888 Vanity Fair caricature of William was originally published with a caption that is quoted, in part: \"Lord Ailesbury is at bottom an excellently good creature ...

It has distinctive wings with characteristic black blotches at their proximal ends, which make the dragonfly look as though it is wearing saddlebags. The black saddlebags is a relatively large dragonfly at about 5 centimeters in length. The body is thin and black, and the female may have lighter spotting or mottling dorsally. The head is much wider than the rest of the body and is dark brown in color. The insect can be found in at bodies of stagnant water, such as ponds and ditches. The female mates once and stores all the sperm she needs for fertilization. If she should mate again, the second male will remove the sperm of the first male from her body with the brush-like apparatus on his specially-adapted penis. The larvae of the dragonflies hatch and eat anything they can catch, favoring a carnivorous diet of organisms smaller than themselves. Adults of the species, especially males, congregate in swarms. Some populations of this dragonfly undertake migrations. Both the larvae and adult forms are efficient predators of mosquitoes, so they are a helpful insect to have in wet areas where mosquito infestations occur.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Jordan News Agency (In Arabic: وكالة الأنباء الأردنية) (Shortly Petra) is the news agency of Jordan.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Bremerton Motorsports Park is a multi-purpose motorsports facility located outside Bremerton and Port Orchard in the state of Washington, USA.

He was Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1403 to 1405. Hallam was originally from Cheshire in northern England and was educated at Oxford University. As Chancellor he, the Proctors, and all others in the University were pardoned by King Henry IV. On leaving the chancellorship, he was nominated in May 1406 by Pope Innocent VII as Archbishop of York, but the appointment was vetoed by King Henry IV in the same year. However, in 1407 he was consecrated by Pope Gregory XII at Siena as Bishop of Salisbury. As bishop, Hallam supported various churches and shrines in his diocese with grants of episcopal indulgences. At the Council of Pisa in 1409, Hallam was one of the English representatives. On 6 June 1411, Antipope John XXIII (Baldassare Cardinal Cossa) purported to make Hallam a pseudocardinal, but this title was not recognised. At the Council of Constance, in November 1414, Hallam was the chief English envoy. There he took a prominent position, as an advocate of Church reform and of the superiority of the council to the pope. He played a leading part in the discussions leading to the deposition of Antipope John XXIII on 29 May 1415, but was less concerned with the trials of Jan Hus and Jerome of Prague. Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, through whose influence the council had been assembled, was absent during the whole of 1416 on a diplomatic mission in France and England; but when he returned to Constance in January 1417, as the open ally of the English king, Hallam as Henry V's trusted representative obtained increased importance, and contrived to emphasise English prestige by delivering the address of welcome to Sigismund. Afterwards, under Henry's direction, he supported the emperor in trying to secure a reform of the Church, before the council proceeded to the election of a new pope. This matter was still undecided when Hallam died suddenly on 4 September 1417. His executors were Masters Richard Hallum, John Fyton, John Hikke, with William Clynt, Thomas Hallum, Thomas Faukys, clerk, & Humfrey Rodeley After Hallam's death the cardinals were able to secure the immediate election of a new pope, Martin V, who was elected on 11 November: it has been said that the abandonment of the reformers by the English was due entirely to Hallam's death; but it is more likely that Henry V, foreseeing the possible need for a change of front, had given Hallam discretionary powers which the bishop's successors used. Hallam himself had the confidence of Sigismund and was generally respected for his straightforward independence. He was buried in Constance Cathedral, where his tomb near the high altar is marked by a brass of English workmanship.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Bromomethane, commonly known as methyl bromide, is an organobromine compound with formula CH 3 Br.

After disappearing in the early 19th century, the manuscript was unexpectedly rediscovered in 1910 in a cupboard in a disused bedroom of the mansion of Hendregadredd near Porthmadog: a note found inside, written by the Archdeacon of Merioneth, Richard Newcome (1779-1857), stated \"I have long been in possession of this Welsh MS. but forget where or how I obtained it\". It is now part of the collection of the National Library of Wales with catalogue number NLW MS 6680B. The manuscript is the earliest witness of the works of the Gogynfeirdd, the Welsh court poets who were active from the early 12th century until the 14th century. It is especially valuable as the only other major source of their work is the Red Book of Hergest. The Hendregadredd Manuscript was probably written at the Cistercian abbey of Strata Florida in Ceredigion. Work began on this collection of poetry sometime after 1282 - first by one main scribe, perhaps the original architect of the volume - but nearly forty different hands were involved in two further strata of scribal activity, working well into the mid-14th century. About 1330 a number of poems by contemporary poets were added, including a poem possibly in the hand of Dafydd ap Gwilym himself, the most famous poet of the day. He had close associations with Strata Florida and tradition has it that he was buried there. Parts of the Hendregadredd Manuscript were copied in 1617 by the scholar John Davies (Mallwyd). Early copies of sections of the manuscript show that some portions of the original have since been lost. In the 17th century the manuscript was in the possession of the antiquary Robert Vaughan as part of his substantial library at Hengwrt, but it was later separated from the rest of his collection.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Exopterygota, also known as Hemipterodea, are a superorder of insects of the subclass Pterygota in the infraclass Neoptera, in which the young resemble adults but have externally developing wings. They undergo a modest change between immature and adult, without going through a pupal stage. The nymphs develop gradually into adults through a process of moulting. The Exopterygota are a highly diverse insect superorder, with at least 130,000 living species divided between 15 orders. They include cockroaches, termites, grasshoppers, thrips, lice and stick insects, among many other types of insects. They are distinguished from the Endopterygota (or Holometabola) by the way in which their wings develop. Endopterygota (meaning literally \"internal winged forms\") develop wings inside the body and undergo an elaborate metamorphosis involving a pupal stage. Exopterygota (\"external winged forms\") develop wings on the outside of their bodies without going through a true pupal stage, though a few have something resembling a pupa (e.g., Aleyrodidae). Ephemeroptera (mayflies) and Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) also have gradual wing development, this being a plesiomorphic trait. These two orders belong to the infraclass Palaeoptera however, which is not included in Neoptera. As opposed to Neoptera, they cannot fold their wings over their back in the horizontal plane, only vertically (as damselflies do) if at all.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Diego Mesaglio (; born February 20, 1984 in Argentina) is a well-known actor, musician and teen idol.

In 1885, two months after the completion of the Franconian Forest Railway, a 7.6 kilometre long Sekundärbahn branch was opened that ran from the Upper Franconian town of Ludwigsstadt to the south Thuringian village of Lehesten. The slate quarries at Lehesten, which in 1880 manufactured 646,226 zentners of roofing and housing slates as well as slate tables, were particularly interested in a railway connexion. A state treaty between the Kingdom of Bavaria und the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen was required, however, to establish the line; this was signed on 16 June 1884. The brunt of the cost (0.515 million marks) was borne by Saxe-Meiningen, the construction and operation of the branch line was carried out by the Royal Bavarian State Railways. Construction began in September 1884 and the line was opened on 1 December 1885. The line branched off the Franconian Forest Railway south of the Trogenbach bridge heading eastwards and followed the rivers Loquitz and Aue. 5.3 kilometres were on Bavarian territory and 2.3 kilometres on Thuringian soil. The largest structures were in Ludwigsstadt: the Hasslach Viaduct and a road bridge. A bridge over the Loquitz at Lehesten was also needed. Until 1945 there were usually four pairs of passenger trains per day with a journey time of about 25 minutes. Goods traffic on the line was also important, especially for the transportation of slate. On 3 July 1945 Thuringia was occupied by Soviet troops and, because the new zonal border, that followed the old state border, crossed the railway line, train services were suspended. Not until 17 June 1947 was goods traffic reinstated between Probstzella and Lehesten, using a pair of scheduled trains and a pair of request trains for transit goods. On 12 July 1951 the transit services were suspended again and by 28 May 1952 the section in Thuringia was dismantled. The remaining section of line in Bavaria was officially closed on 1 March 1971. Until the early 1960s there was still goods traffic to a stone quarry siding at kilometre marker 2.8.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Lamar Community College is the smallest of the Colorado community colleges.

However, an earthquake in 1969 levelled the church. Banja Luka's current cathedral was built in 1974. Currently, Bishop Franjo Komarica is head of the diocese. On Thursday, July 15, 2010, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Father Marko Semren, O.F.M., guardian of the Franciscan convent of Gorica-Livno and professor of the Franciscan Theological Institute of Sarajevo, as auxiliary bishop of Banja Luka to Bishop Komarica. The city of Banja Luka, and much of the territory that the diocese covers contains an Orthodox Christian majority. The Bosnian War greatly affected the diocese. Virtually all of the churches in the bishopric sustained some damage, and many were destroyed. Many Catholics were expelled from the region or fled, leaving only a fraction remaining. Bishop Komarica has been urging people to return, to mixed results.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"No Place Like Brooklyn (stylized as No Place Like BKLYN) is the first album recorded by the singer Jeannie Ortega, released by Hollywood Records on August 1, 2006.

It aims to explain and understand musical behavior and experience, including the processes through which music is perceived, created, responded to, and incorporated into everyday life. Modern music psychology is primarily empirical; its knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic observation of and interaction with human participants. Music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music performance, composition, education, criticism, and therapy, as well as investigations of human attitude, skill, performance, intelligence, creativity, and social behavior. Music psychology can shed light on non-psychological aspects of musicology and musical practice. For example, it contributes to music theory through investigations of the perception and computational modelling of musical structures such as melody, harmony, tonality, rhythm, meter, and form. Research in music history can benefit from systematic study of the history of musical syntax, or from psychological analyses of composers and compositions in relation to perceptual, affective, and social responses to their music. Ethnomusicology can benefit from psychological approaches to the study of music cognition in different cultures.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Dandakosaurus (meaning \"Dandakaranya lizard\") is a genus of theropod dinosaur from Andhra Pradesh, India.

For a topological space X the following conditions are equivalent: An irreducible set is a subset of a topological space for which the subspace topology is irreducible. Some authors do not consider the empty set to be irreducible (even though it vacuously satisfies the above conditions).","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Thomas Gordon (\"Tom\") Mitchell (August 22, 1944 – July 16, 2017) was a college and professional American football player.

Although each unit in an arch or vault is a voussoir, two units are of distinct functional importance: the keystone and the springer. The keystone is the centre stone or masonry unit at the apex of an arch. The springer is the lowest voussoir on each side, located where the curve of the arch springs from the vertical support or abutment of the wall or pier. The keystone is often decorated or enlarged. An enlarged and sometimes slightly dropped keystone is often found in Mannerist arches of the 16th century, beginning with the works of Giulio Romano, who also began the fashion for using voussoirs above rectangular openings, rather than a lintel (Palazzo Stati Maccarani, Rome, circa 1522). The word is a mason's term borrowed in Middle English from French verbs connoting a 'turn' (OED). Each wedge-shaped voussoir turns aside the thrust of the mass above, transferring it from stone to stone to the springer's bottom face ('impost'), which is horizontal and passes the thrust on to the supports. Voussoir arches distribute weight efficiently, and take maximum advantage of the compressive strength of stone, as in an arch bridge. In Visigothic and Moorish architectural traditions, the voussoirs are often in alternating colours, usually red and white. This is sometimes found in Romanesque architecture also. During the 18th and 19th centuries, British bricklayers became aware that, by thickening the vertical mortar joint between regularly shaped bricks from bottom to top, they could construct an elliptical arch of useful strength over either a standard 'former', or over specially constructed timber falsework (temporary structure to be removed once the construction is complete). The bricks used in such an arch are often referred to as 'voussoirs'.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"This is a list of notable events in country music that took place in the year 1984.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Joan is a 1967 album by Joan Baez.

She appeared in 17 Broadway theater productions. Before going off to Vassar for college, Phelps attended Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore along with future actresses Margaret Barker and Mildred Natwick. In college she was a student of Hallie Flanagan at the Vassar Experimental Theatre and aspired to become a Broadway performer. Her father opposed her desire to appear on stage but her mom assisted her by introducing her to actor George Arliss. She visited Arliss at his elegant Beekman Place (Manhattan) apartment and he also tried to discourage Phelps from acting. She joined the University Players Guild for its first season of summer stock in West Falmouth on Cape Cod in 1928 along with Henry Fonda, Joshua Logan, Bretaigne Windust, Charles Leatherbee, Myron McCormick, Kent Smith, and others. On July 29, 1928, Broadway producer Winthrop Ames traveled from New York to Cape Cod specifically to see Phelps in the dress rehearsal for the University Players production of The Jest, a 1919 Broadway comedy by Sem Benelli. Perhaps his trip was occasioned at the suggestion of George Arliss who had starred as Shylock in Ames's Broadway production of Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice during the Broadway season just ended. In any event, Ames offered Phelps the role of Jessica in the post-Broadway national tour of Merchant of Venice. At the end of the University Players 1928 summer season, Phelps left Cape Cod to join Arliss and company and never returned to Falmouth. She loved more than anything being in a play by Mister Shakespeare. Phelps appeared in motion pictures in the early 1930s with roles in The Run Around (1932), The Count of Monte Cristo (1934), and Cleopatra (1934). She believed that some of the best acting was in soap operas. On radio, Phelps starred in Life and Love of Dr. Susan on CBS beginning February 13, 1939. The story dealt with \"the career of a young widow who decides to carry on her medical research after the death of her husband.\" Phelps participated in both soaps and made-for-television productions. Among these are Cinderella (1957), Hallmark Hall of Fame (1961), The Catholic Hour (1967), The Secret Storm (1954), Somerset (1975), Threesome (1984), and Kate & Allie (1989). She played a very rich lady, Grace Tyrrell, on The Secret Storm, from 1970 to 1973. She once did a commercial for Hershey in which she played an elegant lady getting in an elevator with a cow.

Maynes of North Tonawanda, New York who dubbed it the Caterpillar when it debuted in Coney Island, NY in 1925 generates a decent helping of centrifugal force, causing the riders on the inside of the seats to crush the riders on the outside of the seats. It was once found at nearly every amusement park around the USA, but is now so rare that an original Caterpillar ride can only be found operating in two parks today. Though only two Caterpillars are known to be operating, there have been reports claiming there are additional Caterpillars in storage or standing (but not operating) at a few other parks. The ride features a complete circuit of motorized vehicles which are connected end-to-end all the way around the ride, in a manner similar to a Music Express. Also, the cars travel a circular, undulating (wave-like) track very similar to that of a Tumble Bug. This ride is famous for its usually green canopy (one previously located at Geauga Lake had a yellow and black canopy) that automatically, or manually in the case of Heritage Park's, begins to slowly surround the cars and fully encapsulate them once the ride reaches its maximum velocity, though DelGrosso's indoor version called Space Odyssey operated without it. When covered with the canopy, the ride tends to look like a caterpillar, which is probably how Mr. Maynes got the name for his ride. A high powered fan located at one point under the carriage of the ride, was traditionally used to surprise riders with a blast of air as the cars go around the track. The Caterpillar most likely served as Moser Rides' inspiration for the popular Music Express (sometimes Musik Express or Himalaya) style ride.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Diane Sinclair (March 24, 1913, Brooklyn, New York – May 14, 2011, Elmhurst, New York) was an American actress and dancer from 1939 through the 1950s.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Piper PA-8 Skycycle was a 1940s American single-seat light aircraft designed and built by Piper Aircraft at their Lock Haven, Pennsylvania plant.

Seddon makes the distinction between 'failure demand' and 'value demand', which is what the service exists to provide. Failure demand represents a common type of waste found in service organizations. Failure demand is discovered during the application of the Vanguard Method to service organisations. The concept was first used in Seddon's 1992 book, \"I Want you to Cheat\" and again in his 2003 book 'Freedom from Command and Control'. It has since been used by managers in service organisations and borrowed by systems theorists, authors and management consultants across the world. Seddon invented the concept when he discovered that the movement of ‘telephone work’ from local bank branches to call centres in the 1980s caused an explosion in the volumes of demand – the number of phone calls soared. He found that the rise in call volumes was attributable to the creation of ‘failure demand’, i.e. customers calling a second time because the bank had failed to solve their problem on the first call. The same phenomenon also occurred in the public sector as local authorities and housing associations moved telephone work into call centres. Demand was much greater than expected or planned for. Seddon argues that increasing demand was not the result of success but of failure. Seddon's work in local government shows that failure demand in such call centres can run as high as 80% of total demand. The concept of failure demand was adopted in 2008 by the UK Cabinet Office as one of 198 national targets for local authorities. The target was known as NI14 or 'avoidable contact'. The announcement that the indicator would be scrapped came on April 1, 2010. The intention of the target was to cut costs by reducing avoidable contact between local government and its customers. John Seddon was critical, arguing that turning the concept of failure demand into a target would not motivate local authorities to do anything about it. Instead, he said, it would motivate them to under report the amount of failure demand.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":" Pandavaiar  is a river flowing in the Tiruvarur district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"This is a list of flag bearers who have represented the Maldives at the Olympics.

It was released as the second single from her fourth studio album Prism (2013) on October 16, 2013. Inspiration for the song came primarily from a humanitarian trip to Madagascar that Perry made in partnership with UNICEF. Having been surrounded by what she described as unconditional love, she co-wrote it with the song's producers Dr. Luke, Max Martin and Cirkut to reflect that feeling. \"Unconditionally\" is a power ballad styled in rock, backed against a bassline and percussion. Commercially, it peaked within the top ten in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Lebanon, and South Africa as well as the top twenty in Australia, Austria, Canada, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and the United States. The single release was promoted with an Instagram-based campaign, a lyric video directed by Aya Tanimura and live performances—one of the latter, at the American Music Awards of 2013, was the center of controversy due to accusations of cultural appropriation and racism.

Sponsored by Union Pacific Railroad, Last Clear Chance is a safety film intended to warn young drivers to be careful at railroad crossings. The film's cast consists of William Boyett, Harold Agee, Mrs. Harold Agee, Tim Bosworth, William Agee, Christine Lynch, and Lou Spraker. Written by Leland Baxter, the film was shot in parts of Idaho. Wondsel, Carlisle & Dunphy Inc, based in New York City, served as the film's production company. The film centers on the Dixon family, in particular Alan Dixon, who has recently received his driver's license and is eager to begin driving a car. When local police officer Hal Jackson visits the Dixons and learns that Alan's license has arrived, he sits down and tells Alan ways to drive safely and avoid getting into accidents. Although the film is fictional, a real family served as the inspiration for the film's scenario. During production, assistance was provided by staff of the National Safety Council, along with the Idaho State Police and the Colorado State Patrol. Last Clear Chance was distributed by Union Pacific in 1959, and was circulated widely in the years that followed. Met with warm reception from safety workers, the film was featured in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 that originally aired in 1993, and clips from the film were used in the 2004 film Panorama Ephemera. The film's copyright was never registered, and it is in the public domain. A copy of the film is preserved in the Prelinger Archives, where it is able to be downloaded or streamed online free of charge.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Clepsis cristobaliana is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

The term originated with the Near East, meaning a \"forbidden place; sacrosanct, sanctum\", and etymologically related to the Arabic ḥarīm, \"a sacred inviolable place; female members of the family\" and  ḥarām, \"forbidden; sacred\". It has the same meaning as the Turkish word seraglio and Persian word zenana. It is also similar to the Sanskrit word anthapura, meaning ‘the inner apartment’ of the household.The Harem being a forbidden place was constant topic of speculation and curiosity. It was a vibrant and a big physical space where women were arranged in regard to their proximity to the Emperor. Most women usually entered the Harem through marriage, birth, appointments or as gifts. It came to mean the sphere of women in what was usually a polygynous household and their segregated quarters which were forbidden to men. Harems were composed of wives, female relatives, concubines, and male infants. The women were governed through strict rules of Purdah, and they could not move out of the harem as they liked, but many women travelled for affairs of pilgrimage to local shrines, hunting and sightseeing with the Emperor. They always moved out in beautifully decorated palanquins or on the back of the elephants. Inside the Harem they led a luxurious and a comfortable life. The Harem had gardens, fountains and water channels attached to it. There were various departments within the Mughal Harem that fulfilled the basic needs of its inmates, The food was provided from the Royal Kitchen known as Maktabh and the Akbar Khanah provided drinking water and wine. The Ritab Khanah was in charge of supplying bread and the Maywa Khanah provided fruits to the household. Things of personal use of the women such as Beautiful dresses, jewellery, fancy articles and other household items were provided by the Imperial Karkhanah. The harem was not just a place where women lived. Babies were born and children grew up there. Within the precincts of the harem were markets, bazaars, laundries, kitchens, playgrounds, schools and baths. The harem had a hierarchy, its chief authorities being the wives and female relatives of the emperor and below them were the concubines. Mothers, step-mothers, aunts, grandmothers, step-sisters, sisters, daughters and other female relatives lived in the harem. There were also ladies-in-waiting, servants, maids, cooks, women official and guards. The Humayun Nama provides an interesting insight into the lives of Mughal women. It was written by Gulbadan Begum, who was Babur’s daughter. She describes in great detail the conflicts and tensions in the empire and how women played a mediating role in resolving them. For instance, Gulbadan Begum and Hamida Bano brought about peace in the household when Salim revolutioned against his father in1601 AD. She also indicates that women knew about the political changes going on in their world and how they played a role in them. For example, She was approached by the traitor Mirza Kamran to write a letter to his brother asking him to join Kamran’s campaign against the emperor. The harem of the Mughal Empire was guarded by Eunuch s, as well as female warriors called Urdubegis. With the construction of Fatehpur Sikri, Emperor Akbar saw need to organize the administration of his Zenana. This portion of the palace was reputably home to more than five thousand women. While Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak claims in the Akbarnama that each woman had her own suite of rooms, it is more likely that only members of the royal family and favorites of the emperor had their own apartments. The zenana was divided into sections, with (female) daroghas tending to the organizational needs of the residents, and working to keep the peace. Other administrative positions within the zenana included the tehwildars, or accounts officers responsible for the salaries and financial requests of the zenana inhabitants. The Mahaldar, the female servant of highest authority, often acted as an intelligence source from the zenana directly to the emperor. The anagas, or royal wet-nurses, were elevated to positions of rank though their purpose was not strictly administrative. Mughal women had a noteworthy control over the financial resources and were involved in various economic activities. They enjoyed annual incomes and used eunuchs as agents of commerce. Many women also commissioned buildings and gardens. Shah Jahan’s daughter, Jahanara contributed in many architectural projects of Shah Jahan’s new capital, Shahjahanabad and she as well as her sister, Roshanara enjoyed an annual income often equal to that of high imperial mansabdars. They also had a strong administrative control over the domestic trade and gained large revenues from various towns. Jahanara received revenues from the port city of Surat, which was a profitable centre of overseas trade, Nur Jahan by system of tolls from internal trade had an income of 230,000 mahmudis. They combined their Economic sense with Political Activities to strengthen the monarchy and the empire.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Corbyn is both a surname and a given name.
