Until the fifteenth century, the Saxon Hofgericht (court) was linked to the Electors and moved around the country as he did. In 1483 Elector Ernest and his brother Duke Albert III established the Oberhofgericht, a court with a fixed seat in Leipzig. The court was controlled by both nobles and Burgers and was the first authority established in Saxony to be independent of the Electors and the court. The court was founded with authority over all Saxony, but after the Partition of the Wettin lands, it applied only to the Albertine lands (including collateral lines of Saxe-Weissenfels, Saxe-Merseburg and Saxe-Zeitz) from 1483 to 1493 and again from 1547. After 1529 it ceased to have authority over Wittenberg, which came under the jurisdiction of the newly established Electoral Circle (Kurkreis). From 1493 until 1547, the Oberhofgericht met alternately in Leipzig and Altenburg and had authority over both Albertine and Ernestine lands. In 1488 the court received a new assessor. Later the court was raised to a full bench of twelve people. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, six of these seats belonged to the nobility, including the Oberhofgerichters, and six learned men (doctores) with the Professor of law at the University of Leipzig. Both sides were filled out by unpaid, extraordinary assessors. The Oberhofgericht was primarily in charge of Private law and had some control over feudal law. On the other hand, administrative law, criminal law and ecclesiastical law remained outside its control. It was the court of first instance only for members of the Wettin princely house, schriftsässig lords of manors, universities, schriftsässig cities and the holders of important honours and offices, so only these people had direct access to the court. For the majority of Saxons, it was an appellate court. In 1822, the Oberhofgericht lost its role as an appellate court. With the 1831 state reform in the Kingdom of Saxony, a progressive transformation of the judiciary was begun. In the course of this reform, the Oberhofgericht was abolished.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Terror of Rome Against the Son of Hercules () is a 1964 Italian peplum film directed by \tMario Caiano and starring Mark Forest and Marilù Tolo.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Rajahmundry Municipal Corporation is the civic body that governs the city of Rajahmundry in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Pigeons Playing Ping Pong is an American funk jam band from Baltimore, Maryland.

The MII is standardized by IEEE 802.3u and connects different types of PHYs to MACs. Being media independent means that different types of PHY devices for connecting to different media (i.e. Twisted pair copper, fiber optic, etc.) can be used without redesigning or replacing the MAC hardware. Thus any MAC may be used with any PHY, independent of the network signal transmission media. The MII can be used to connect a MAC to an external PHY using a pluggable connector, or directly to a PHY chip which is on the same PCB. On a PC the CNR connector Type B carries MII bus interface signals. The Management Data Input/Output (MDIO) serial bus is a subset of the MII that is used to transfer management information between MAC and PHY. At powerup, using autonegotiation, the PHY usually adapts to whatever it is connected to unless settings are altered via the MDIO interface. The original MII transfers data using 4-bit nibbles in each direction (4 transmit data bits, 4 receive data bits). The data is clocked at 25 MHz to achieve 100 Mbit/s throughput. The original MII design has been extended to support reduced signals and increased speeds. Current variants include, reduced media-independent interface (RMII), gigabit media-independent interface (GMII), reduced gigabit media-independent interface (RGMII), 10-gigabit media-independent interface (XGMII) and serial gigabit media-independent interface (SGMII).","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Karenni States, also known as Red Karen States, was the name formerly given to the states inhabited mainly by the Red Karen, in the area of present-day Kayah State, eastern Burma.

This verse is part of the resurrection narrative. An angel has appeared at the empty tomb and in this verse he gives instructions to Mary Magdalene and \"the other Mary\". The original Koine Greek, according to Westcott and Hort, reads: In the King James Version of the Bible it is translated as: After a short diversion found only in Matthew, 28:5 has Matthew rejoining Mark, with these verses parallelling Mark 16:7. In Mark the women had felt fear at the presence of the angel, but in Matthew only the guards are mentioned as being afraid so the connection is less direct in this gospel. In the previous verse the guards were so struck by fear that they collapsed. Keener notes that the angel had no interest in assuaging the fear of the guards, making it clear that the message of the angel is intended for only the women. An angel issues the same \"do not to be afraid\" at Matthew 1:20, implying that this is perhaps the same angel as in the infancy narrative. The words of the angel are almost identical to the ones spoken by it in Mark. One change is that in Mark the Jesus is called \"the Nazarean.\" Unlike Mark, Matthew does not generally use that title, and it's dropped several times in his gospel. The tense of the word translated as crucified specifically denotes a complete act with continuing consequences, emphasizing the importance of the event. Since Matthew has the women still outside of the tomb, this verse also deviates from Mark by having the angel request that the women enter the tomb. In Mark the angel invites the women to see where \"they put him,\" but Matthew had Joseph of Arimathea acting alone, so he drops the they and reorders that part of the sentence. These verses are part of a series of pieces of evidence Matthew presents to prove the truth of the resurrection story and refute the stolen body hypothesis, which at this time was being advanced by non-Christians. Having the women enter the tomb confirms that it was empty just after the stone was removed. These are also the same women that had earlier witnesses Jesus' interment at Matthew 27:60-61, so there is no doubt of a mistake. The angel also references back to Jesus' prophesies of his own resurrection, thus helping confirm that Jesus was a true prophet.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Complement decay-accelerating factor, also known as CD55 or DAF, is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the CD55 gene. DAF regulates the complement system on the cell surface. It recognizes C4b and C3b fragments that are created during activation of C4 (classical or lectin pathway) or C3 (alternative pathway). Interaction of DAF with cell-associated C4b of the classical and lectin pathways interferes with the conversion of C2 to C2b, thereby preventing formation of the C4b2b C3-convertase, and interaction of DAF with C3b of the alternative pathway interferes with the conversion of factor B to Bb by factor D, thereby preventing formation of the C3bBb C3 convertase of the alternative pathway. Thus, by limiting the amplification convertases of the complement cascade, DAF indirectly blocks the formation of the membrane attack complex. This glycoprotein is broadly distributed among hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. It is a determinant for the Cromer blood group system.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Pasuk Phongpaichit (,, born 11 February 1946) is a Thai economist.

The magazine has been featured in Rolling Stone, the Chicago Tribune, and on NPR's Talk of the Nation. He is the former proprietor of the Slamdek Record Company which released early recordings by influential punk and indie rock bands including Endpoint, Rodan, Jawbox, and Ritcher's own bands Sunspring and the Metroschifter. The label's first release was a cassette tape by the synthesizer band Pink Aftershock in 1986 and its last was a Sunspring retrospective CD in 1995. Slamdek pressed 44 different records during its nine years in business. In 1998, Ritcher entered politics as the Reform Party's candidate for Mayor of Louisville. Though he spent only $1000 on the campaign, Ritcher had a respectable showing at the polls and finished third of four candidates. He announced his candidacy in early 2008 as an independent candidate for Kentucky Senate from District 35. A controversial lawsuit brought by the Democratic incumbent Denise Harper Angel eventually disqualified Ritcher from the race. Angel's suit alleged that some of the signatures gathered on Ritcher's ballot petition were those of voters living outside the lines of Kentucky's State Senate District 35 and therefore inadmissible. Reporting the verdict, the political site Page One Kentucky published the entire court order and noted, \"while votes for Ritcher will no longer be counted, the court still backs Ritcher's honesty by plainly stating that the district boundaries that create the 35th Senate District are confusing.\" In 2008, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported that his company K Composite \"has completed the sale of its social networking site EggFly.com to a startup company, Ikimbo 2.0 of Radnor, Pennsylvania.\" According to the bio on his campaign website, he has been a contributor to LEO, Velocity Weekly, College Music Journal, public radio's This American Life, and appeared as a newspaper photographer in the 1999 film The Insider.

He suggests that the medium affects the society in which it plays a role mainly by the characteristics of the medium rather than the content. The book is considered a pioneering study in media theory. McLuhan pointed to the light bulb as an example. A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that \"a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence.\" More controversially, he postulated that content had little effect on society—in other words, it did not matter if television broadcasts children's shows or violent programming, to illustrate one example—the effect of television on society would be identical. He noted that all media have characteristics that engage the viewer in different ways; for instance, a passage in a book could be reread at will, but a movie had to be screened again in its entirety to study any individual part of it.The book is the source of the well-known phrase \"The medium is the message\". It was a leading indicator of the upheaval of local cultures by increasingly globalized values. The book greatly influenced academics, writers, and social theorists.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Cool Whip is a brand of imitation whipped cream, referred to as a whipped topping by its manufacturer, Kraft Heinz.

It is endemic to Mount Kinabalu and neighbouring Mount Tambuyukon in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Nepenthes rajah grows exclusively on serpentine substrates, particularly in areas of seeping ground water where the soil is loose and permanently moist. The species has an altitudinal range of 1500 to 2650 m a.s.l. and is thus considered a highland or sub-alpine plant. Due to its localised distribution, ''N. rajah'' is classified as an endangered species by the IUCN and listed on CITES Appendix I. The species was collected by Hugh Low on Mount Kinabalu in 1858, and described the following year by Joseph Dalton Hooker, who named it after James Brooke, the first White Rajah of Sarawak. Hooker called it \"one of the most striking vegetable productions hither-to discovered\". Since being introduced into cultivation in 1881, Nepenthes rajah has always been a much sought-after species. For a long time, the plant was seldom seen in private collections due to its rarity, price, and specialised growing requirements. However, recent advances in tissue culture technology have resulted in prices falling dramatically, and ''N. rajah'' is now relatively widespread in cultivation. Nepenthes rajah is most famous for the giant urn-shaped traps it produces, which can grow up to 41 cm high and 20 cm wide. These are capable of holding 3.5 litres of water and in excess of 2.5 litres of digestive fluid, making them probably the largest in the genus by volume. Another morphological feature of ''N. rajah'' is the peltate leaf attachment of the lamina and tendril, which is present in only a few other species. The plant is known to occasionally trap vertebrates and even small mammals, with drowned rats having been observed in the pitcher-shaped traps. It is one of only two Nepenthes species documented as having caught mammalian prey in the wild, the other being N. rafflesiana. N. rajah is also known to occasionally trap small vertebrates such as frogs, lizards and even birds, although these cases probably involve sick animals and certainly do not represent the norm. Insects, and particularly ants, comprise the staple prey in both aerial and terrestrial pitchers. Although Nepenthes rajah is most famous for trapping and digesting animals, its pitchers are also host to a large number of other organisms, which are thought to form a mutually beneficial (symbiotic) association with the plant. Many of these animals are so specialised that they cannot survive anywhere else, and are referred to as nepenthebionts. N. rajah has two such mosquito taxa named after it: Culex rajah and Toxorhynchites rajah. Another key feature of ''N. rajah'' is the relative ease with which it is able to hybridise in the wild. Hybrids between it and all other Nepenthes species on Mount Kinabalu have been recorded. However, due to the slow-growing nature of ''N. rajah'', few hybrids involving the species have been artificially produced yet.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"ConnNet was a packet switched data network operated by the Southern New England Telephone Company serving the U.S. state of Connecticut.

Completed in 1843, the work was published as Schumann's Op. 50. The work is based on a German translation (by Schumann and his friend Emil Flechsig) of a tale from Lalla-Rookh by Thomas Moore. The peri, a creature from Persian mythology, is the focus of the story, having been expelled from Paradise and trying to regain entrance by giving the gift that is most dear to heaven. Eventually the peri is admitted after bringing a tear from the cheek of a repentant old sinner who has seen a child praying. Peter Ostwald in his biography Schumann: The Inner Voices of a Musical Genius records that Schumann \"confided to a friend that 'while writing Paradise and the Peri a voice occasionally whispered to me \"what you are doing is not done completely in vain,\" and that even Richard Wagner praised this work. The cantata is generally held to be a significant achievement by Schumann, and it perhaps appeals less than it might otherwise to modern audiences due to the flowery, Eastern-inspired verbiage of the libretto, which represents a vogue for orientalism that was in full swing in the 19th century but has receded considerably today.The first English performance took place under difficult conditions at the Hanover Square Rooms in London at the invitation of the Philharmonic Society conducted by William Sterndale Bennett with Jenny Lind taking the leading soprano part.Paradise and the Peri was the vehicle for Gabrielle Krauss's first important appearance, in Vienna in 1858, when she was not yet 16 years old.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Popkomm was an international trade show for the music and entertainment business during the 1990s and 2000s, and also integrated a congress and festival.

It generally does well in response to fires, due to survival of rhizomes and seeds. It can be found in open woodland, rough grassland, hedgerows, roadsides and waste ground, and as a weed on arable land.

Bart Simpson's classic \"I didn't do it, no one saw me do it, you can't prove anything!\" could be considered a somewhat humorous example. In a more serious example, a lawyer might argue, not only that his client was elsewhere when a murder or other crime took place, but also that even if he had been on the scene, he would have had no way of accessing the alleged murder weapon. In this way, the lawyer attacks several premises of the prosecution's argument at once. The secondary line of reasoning might be presented to persuade a sub-audience who would not otherwise agree with the primary argument. In regards to contract law, arguing in the alternative is done where a dispute arises over the terms of a contract. In a particular case it may be best for the plaintiff to allege that a statement made was to become a term of the contract. However the circumstances of the case may be such that the plaintiff cannot be certain that the court will accept this argument. To allow for this possibility, all the plaintiff need do is to argue in the alternative that the statement was in fact a representation (which allows for remedies based on misrepresentation) or again in the alternative that the statement became a part of a collateral contract. Occasionally, such arguments can be confusing to some people, who perceive a self-contradiction. Generally speaking, this is a case of mistakenly thinking the argument claims both alternatives are true, when in reality it is claiming only that one or the other of them must be.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":", commonly called the  is one of the Buddhist temples in the city of Kamakura in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, famous for housing a massive wooden statue of Kannon.

The UNAVCO academic and research community seeks to broaden human understanding of the changing Earth by integrating technologies, open geodetic observations, and research. UNAVCO is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and supports research around the world. As a university-governed consortium, UNAVCO is collectively tasked with advancing and supporting the science goals of the community. UNAVCO currently has over 100 US academic members, and supports over 65 organizations as associate members. Before incorporation in 2001, UNAVCO existed under different organizational umbrellas for nearly two decades as the University Navstar Consortium, then primarily serving geophysicists and geodesists who study tectonic deformation using high-precision GPS technology. Since 2003, UNAVCO's scope has expanded significantly, with service to new science communities – including those who focus on the deformation of ice, the Earth's response to ground water, sea level, and other aspects of the hydrosphere, and renewed interest in imaging the structure of the atmosphere. UNAVCO has also expanded its support of new geodetic tools: advancing GPS towards mm-level global GPS geodesy and to streaming high rate observations; borehole strain meters and seismometers, expanded geodetic imaging using lidar for Airborne Laser Swath Mapping, InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar), and Terrestrial Laser Scanning, web services and cyberinfrastructure. GPS is finding applications in a frequency range that used to be the sole provenance of seismology, as GPS measurements grow from one solution per day to one solution per second, with high precision. As of October, 2013, UNAVCO operates the GAGE (Geodesy Advancing Geosciences and EarthScope) Facility, located in Boulder, Colorado with regional offices in San Clemente, California and Anchorage, Alaska. The Facility provides science support through community coordination, field engineering, data services, technology innovation, and instrument testing, acquisition, and deployment. It provides scientific support to global geodetic infrastructure that is developed and operated through international collaborations. EarthScope, a set of integrated geophysical observatories, supports investigation of the entire temporal spectrum of Earth deformation processes. In particular, the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) provides geodetic imaging of plate boundary deformation. UNAVCO undertook an internal reorganization to refine its community support and advisory committees. Three UNAVCO programs focus on: (1) Geodetic Infrastructure; (2) Geodetic Data Services; and (3) Education and Community Engagement.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The following page lists all power stations in Rwanda.

There are usually 2 to 5 of these glands in the upper eyelid, and their function is to produce tears which are secreted onto the surface of the conjunctiva. They are named after Italian anatomist Giuseppe Vincenzo Ciaccio (1824–1901), who described these glands in 1874. They are sometimes called \"Wolfring's glands\" after Polish ophthalmologist Emilj von Wolfring (1832-1906), who described them during the same time period as did Ciaccio.

It was named after Leo Tolstoy. The albedo feature Solitudo Maiae appears to be associated with this crater. The impact that produced the Tolstoj Basin occurred very early in the history of Mercury. Two ragged, discontinuous rings approximately 356 km and 510 km in diameter encompass the structure but are poorly developed on its north and northeast sides; a third partial ring with a diameter of 466 km occurs on its southeast side. Diffuse patches of material of dark albedo lie outside the innermost ring. The central part of the basin is covered by a high reflectance smooth plains (HRP) material. The bright interior of the basin is noticeably redder than the surrounding plains, which are made of a bluer low reflectance material (LRM). The dark annulus of ejecta around Tolstoj is one of the darkest places on the surface of Mercury. The depth of Tolstoj is estimated to be 2.0 ± 0.7 km from the stereo derived digital elevation models based on Mariner 10 images of the planet. This is significantly less than the depth of lunar basins of the similar size indicating that Tolstoj probably has relaxed from its post impact shape. The Tolstoj basin is used to define a time-stratigraphic system, the Tosltojan system, with the age of around 4.0–3.9 billion years. The older system (< 4.0 billion years) is called pre-Tosltojan, while the younger is called Calorian (3.9–3.5 billion years). Despite Tolstoj’s great age and its embayment by the ancient inter-crater plains, it retains an extensive and remarkably well preserved, radially lineated ejecta blanket around two-thirds of its circumference. The ejecta tends to be blocky and only weakly lineated between the inner and outer rings. Radial lineations with a slight swirly pattern are best seen on the southwest side of Tolstoj. The unusual rectilinear map pattern of the ejecta suggests: (1) control of the ejecta pattern by prebasin structures, (2) preferential burial along structural trends of an originally symmetrical ejecta blanket by the intercrater plains material, or (3) formation of Tolstoj by an oblique impact from the northwest that produced an ejecta blanket with bilateral symmetry and little or no deposition uprange. Analysis of stereophotography of Tolstoj ejecta northeast of the crater suggests that this deposit has been upwarped to a higher elevation relative to the surrounding plains.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The '''2008 CIS Men's Final 8 Basketball Tournament''' was held March 14–16, 2008.

Grounding transformers are part of an earthing system of the network. They let three-wire (delta) system supplies accommodate phase-to-neutral loads by providing a return path for current to a neutral. Grounding transformers most commonly incorporate a single winding transformer with a zigzag winding configuration, but may also be created with a wye-delta winding transformer. Neutral grounding transformers are very common on generators in power plants and wind farms. Neutral grounding transformers are sometimes applied on high-voltage (sub-transmission) systems, such as at 33 kV, where the circuit would otherwise not have a ground; for example, if a system is fed by a delta-connected transformer. The grounding point of the transformer may be connected through a resistor to limit the fault current on the system in the event of a line-to-ground fault.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Cleo Gibson was a classic female blues singer active in the 1920s.

The congregation began as a Sunday school in the northwest part of the city organized by Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church. The evangelist Billy Sunday had preached a revival there and over 300 people joined the church. St. James Methodist Episcopal Church, as it was then known, was established shortly afterward in February 1910. The congregation originally used the closed Danish Lutheran Church at K Avenue NW and Fourth Street NW for their services, and they moved the building that summer to Ellis Boulevard NW. St. James grew to the point that a new building was needed. In 1945 property across the street was purchased, and local architect William J. Brown designed the new church facility. Construction began in September 1952 and it was completed in April 1954 for $165,000. The church building is a modern interpretation of the Gothic Revival style. The gabled-ell form structure houses the sanctuary, administrative, educational and social spaces. Brown utilized the Interdenominational Bureau of Architecture's guide ''Planning Church Architecture: Designs, Floor Plans and Recommendations to Help in Planning Church Buildings for Worship, Religious Education, and Fellowship Activities to Cost from $30,000.00 to $850,000.00'' (1945) for the basis of his work.

It was released on 2 October 1995 in Francophone countries and in December 1995 in selected European countries. In Canada it was a radio-only release (July 1995). The narrator of the song boasts that she is unafraid to face any number of tribulations and challenges of the body and spirit, but admits life without the one she loves just might be more than she could bear. Dion has stated that this is one of her favorites among her songs, because it reminds her of her feelings for husband René Angélil. \"Je sais pas\" was written and produced by Jean-Jacques Goldman and J. Kapler. Two music videos were made for this song: a non-singing version and a performance (singing) one, both of which were directed by Gregg Masuak in 1995. These music videos can be found on Dion's DVD On ne change pas (2005). Edited versions of the non-singing video were also used for \"Next Plane Out\" and \"Call the Man\" singles (none of them were released in France). An English version of this song, called \"I Don't Know\" was featured on Falling into You. Live version of \"Je sais pas\" from Live à Paris was also released as a single, on 19 May 1997 in the Netherlands to promote that album. The song was featured on Dion's greatest hits compilation On ne change pas. The live version was a part of two other albums: Live à Paris and Au cœur du stade; the former was also released as a single on 19 May 1997 in the Netherlands to promote the live album. Dion also performed it during the French concerts of her 2008-09 Taking Chances World Tour. The audio and footage of this performance was included in the French edition of Taking Chances World Tour: The Concert CD/DVD. In 2013, the song was performed for the Sans attendre Tour; the Quebec performance was included in the Céline une seule fois / Live 2013 CD/DVD. \"Je sais pas\" was a smash hit in France, where it topped the singles chart for seven weeks, selling 510,000 copies (should be certified platinum but it remains undercertified with silver award). It was also number 1 in Belgium Wallonia (for two weeks) and Quebec (four weeks). The 1995 studio version peaked at number 34 in the Netherlands. The 1997 live version from Live à Paris reached number 78.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Siversky is an air base in Leningrad Oblast, Russia, 2 km northwest of Siversky.
