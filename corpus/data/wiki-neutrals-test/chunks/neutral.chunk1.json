It is in the civil parish of Heath and Holmewood. The village of Holmewood was formed as a residence by The Williamthorpe Colliery Company from 1905 until 1970, when it closed due to the high cost of deep seam mining. The colliery was the main employer of the village and upon its closure, caused much unemployment within the area. As a consequence of the Margaret Thatcher Government in the late 1980s, plans were put in place to construct two large industrial estates to limit the high unemployment levels within the ex-colliery communities in the North Derbyshire Area. This industrial estate has now expanded to cover a much larger area and is known as the 'Holmewood Enterprise Zone'. Due to EU Government incentives, the site attracts high levels of investment from national-level companies. Currently the village is undergoing some big changes with new developments and an expansion of new housing. There is also a countryside park on the site, which is known as the Five Pits Trail, which links the five villages around Holmewood. The area contains several ponds that, once heavily polluted, are now havens for wildlife and are popular with anglers and birdwatchers. The village has many small shops, public houses, churches and a public library. The closest ally to the village of Holmewood are in the nearest village of Heath.

It has been sometimes called repositioning of culture, which means the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society. It places stress on the social and cultural capital determinants of decision making and the manner in which these interact with other factors like the availability of information or the financial incentives facing individuals to drive behavior. These cultural capital influences include the role of parenting, families and close associates; organizations such as schools and workplaces; communities and neighborhoods; and wider social influences such as the media. It is argued that this cultural capital manifests into specific values, attitudes or social norms which in turn guide the behavioral intentions that individuals adopt in regard to particular decisions or courses of action. These behavioral intentions interact with other factors driving behavior such as financial incentives, regulation and legislation, or levels of information, to drive actual behavior and ultimately feed back into underlying cultural capital. In general, cultural stereotypes present great resistance to change and to their own redefinition. Culture, often appears fixed to the observer at any one point in time because cultural mutations occur incrementally. The cultural change is a long-lasting process.

A differential equation model is one that describes the value of dependent variables as they evolve in time or space by giving equations involving those variables and their derivatives with respect to some independent variables, usually time and/or space. An ordinary differential equation is one in which the system's dependent variables are functions of only one independent variable. Many physical, chemical, biological and electrical systems are well described by ordinary differential equations. Frequently we assume a system is governed by differential equations, but we do not have exact knowledge of the influence of various factors on the state of the system. For instance, we may have an electrical circuit that in theory is described by a system of ordinary differential equations, but due to the tolerance of resistors, variations of the supply voltage or interference from outside influences we do not know the exact parameters of the system. For some systems, especially those that support chaos, a small change in parameter values can cause a large change in the behavior of the system, so an accurate model is extremely important. Therefore, it may be necessary to construct more exact differential equations by building them up based on the actual system performance rather than a theoretical model. Ideally, one would measure all the dynamical variables involved over an extended period of time, using many different initial conditions, then build or fine tune a differential equation model based on these measurements. In some cases we may not even know enough about the processes involved in a system to even formulate a model. In other cases, we may have access to only one dynamical variable for our measurements, i.e., we have a scalar time series. If we only have a scalar time series, we need to use the method of time delay embedding or derivative coordinates to get a large enough set of dynamical variables to describe the system. In a nutshell, once we have a set of measurements of the system state over some period of time, we find the derivatives of these measurements, which gives us a local vector field, then determine a global vector field consistent with this local field. This is usually done by a least squares fit to the derivative data.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"\"Save Our Love\" is a song recorded by the British R&B girl group Eternal.

It was completed in 1851, as a critical part of the Longdendale Chain project that brings fresh water to Manchester. The Manchester Corporation Waterworks Act 1847 gave permission for the construction of the Woodhead, Hollingworth and Arnfield reservoirs, and the construction of a masonry aqueduct to convey drinking water from Arnfield and Hollingworth to a service reservoir at Godley. Water was captured from the River Etherow and stored in the great reservoirs and then flowed through the 6-foot bore Mottram Tunnel to Godley. At Godley the water was filtered by passing it through straining frames made of oak and fine wires. It was chlorinated to remove bacteria and then entered Manchester's water distribution network. This method was successfully used until the early 1960s, when additional treatment works were built at Arnfield and Godley.

They are a rare type of meteorite; as of November 2014 only 208 are known (of which 56 come from Antarctica) and only 7 of these are observed falls. On the other hand, some mesosiderites are among the largest meteorites known. At Vaca Muerta in the Atacama Desert in Chile, many fragments with a total mass of 3.8 tons were found in a large strewnfield. They were first discovered in the 19th century by ore prospectors who mistook the shiny metal inclusions for silver and thought they had found an outcrop of a silver ore deposit. Later when an analysis was made and nickel-iron was found, the true nature as a meteorite was established. The meteorite was called Vaca Muerta. The picture at right shows a cut and polished piece of Vaca Muerta. The most recent fall of a mesosiderite occurred at Dong Ujimqin Qi in China, on September 7, 1995, where three large pieces with a total mass of 129 kg fell. The fall of the Estherville mesosiderite in Iowa, US occurred on May 10, 1879. After a brilliant fireball had been seen, a shower of several large masses and many small fragments fell, totaling 320 kg. The fall at Lowicz in Poland on March 12, 1935 yielded many (more than 50) fragments with a total weight of 59 kg.

Arruga had previously been brought to the police station for allegedly stealing three mobile phones.

This beautiful rustic nut of Ardeche origin has a bright, streaky chestnut colour. Its fine, sweet and fragrant flesh justifies the excellent taste reputation. The Comballe takes its name from the Combeaux, farmhouse of the canton of Saint-Pierreville, in the mountains of the Ardeche and Vivarais. It originated in the beginning of the eighteenth century and spread through the region. Its very bright chestnut color features honey reflections with very characteristic dark and regular streaks. Its shape is elliptical elongated. Its tuft is long and fine and its attachment scar (hilum) is large, clear and rectangular. The Comballe is a characteristic variety produced in the Ardèche, the largest chestnut production region in France. It is so appreciated that it makes up one third of the total production in this region. The tree is particularly suitable for its original region, the Boutieres and the Ardèche centre. It thrives at 400 m to 650 m elevation in the Cevennes in Ardèche but also in Lozere. Given its superior qualities it has supplanted many local varieties. The flesh of the nut - white, fine, sweet and fragrant - is recognized as one of the best. These taste qualities make the nut good for all uses and preparations including chestnut cream. The Comballe nut peels easily but can have multiple embryos. The late developing pericarp, makes the nut vulnerable to codling and rot in hot and humid autumns. The preservation of the nuts is complicated. Because of its fragile bark, the tree is particularly exposed to chestnut blight. Comballe trees produce high nut yields of sizable caliber: between 30 to 70 nuts per kilogram. A clone of the Comballe named \"Marron Comballe\" (CA106) has the advantage of having a nut a little more rarely compartmentalized.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Euamiana endopolia is a species of owlet moth in the family Noctuidae.

There are many species of wheat which together make up the genus Triticum; the most widely grown is common wheat (''T. aestivum''). The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BCE. Botanically, the wheat kernel is a type of fruit called a caryopsis. Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop (220.4 million hectares, 2014). World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined. In 2016, world production of wheat was 749 million tonnes, making it the second most-produced cereal after maize. Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century. Global demand for wheat is increasing due to the unique viscoelastic and adhesive properties of gluten proteins, which facilitate the production of processed foods, whose consumption is increasing as a result of the worldwide industrialization process and the westernization of the diet. Wheat is an important source of carbohydrates. Globally, it is the leading source of vegetal protein in human food, having a protein content of about 13%, which is relatively high compared to other major cereals but relatively low in protein quality for supplying essential amino acids. When eaten as the whole grain, wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber. In a small part of the general population, gluten – the major part of wheat protein – can trigger coeliac disease, non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, gluten ataxia and dermatitis herpetiformis.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"is a city located in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan.

He is also a portrait and comic book artist. Bill Schelly has been a comic book enthusiast since 1960. He was living in a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania when he heard about comics fandom in 1964. Upon seeing his first amateur publication about comics, a mimeographed fanzine called Batmania, Schelly decided to become a fanzine publisher himself. He launched Super-Heroes Anonymous in February 1965, the first in a string of magazines he edited and published until 1972. It was for his fanzine Sense of Wonder that Schelly became known to the comics community. Begun while living in Pittsburgh, but mostly published after he moved to Lewiston, Idaho, in 1967, it began as a collection of amateur comic strips and stories. In 1970, while attending the University of Idaho, Schelly changed the format of Sense of Wonder to a \"general fanzine\" made up of articles and artwork about the history of comic books. By the end of its 12-issue run, Sense of Wonder had presented the first attempt to chronicle the whole career of comics innovator Will Eisner, as well as work by Steve Ditko, Frank Frazetta and Stanley Pitt. It was discontinued after he graduated from college in 1973. Schelly’s first published book was Harry Langdon, a biography of the silent film comedian, published by Scarecrow Press in 1982. Schelly played a part in a revival of interest in silent cinema in Seattle at the time, and lectured on the subject at the University of Washington. The Journal of Popular Film & Television said of Harry Langdon, \"William Schelly's remarkable first book ... should be relished by anyone who appreciates screen comedy and Langdon's unique approach to it.\" After over a decade away from comics fandom, Schelly re-joined \"comics apa\" (amateur press alliance) CAPA-alpha, a conglomeration of generally brief publications distributed each month to a roster of 40 participants. In 1991, one of the members was Jeff Gelb, someone Schelly had known and collaborated with in the 1960s. Gelb helped re-introduce Schelly to fandom in the 1990s. At that time, Schelly began researching the history of the classic era of comic book fandom. He conducted interviews and formed the Comic Fandom Archive, a collection of vintage fanzines, original art, old correspondence and other memorabilia. As part of his research, Schelly interviewed many of fandom's founders, with fortuitous timing since many have since died, Don Thompson, Jerry Bails, Howard Keltner, Ronn Foss, Biljo White, Grass Green, Landon Chesney, and G. B. Love among them. Schelly began producing a series of fanzine-format publications (The History of the Amateur Comic Strip, the Ronn Foss Retrospective, The Alley Tally Party, and Labors of Love) under the aegis of his own small publishing company named Hamster Press. Eventually, his research culminated in a book-length manuscript called The Golden Age of Comic Fandom. When no publisher was interested, he published it in trade paperback form himself in 1995 as a limited edition of 1000 copies (signed and numbered). This book received a tremendous response from members of early fandom, quickly sold out, and was nominated for a Will Eisner Comic Industry Award. A revised and expanded edition was published in 1998, and another printing was done in 2003. Schelly followed The Golden Age of Comic Fandom with a series of Hamster Press books on the history of comic book fandom which were distributed by Diamond Comics as well as sold directly from the publisher. Those books were Fandom’s Finest Comics Vol. 1 & 2, Alter Ego: The Best of the Legendary Comics Fanzine (with Roy Thomas), Giant Labors of Love, Comic Fandom Reader, and The Best of Star-Studded Comics. His most recent fandom-themed book, Founders of Comic Fandom, was published in 2010 by McFarland books. In 1997, Schelly organized a reunion of old-time comics fans during the Chicago Comicon, which drew 33 people including Jerry Bails, Howard Keltner, Maggie Thompson and Jay Lynch. Discussions at this comicon led to a decision to bring back Alter Ego in TwoMorrows Publishing’s Comic Book Artist magazine. Schelly became associate editor of the endeavor, which proved so successful that it became its own magazine in 1999. He has contributed a series of Comic Fandom Archive articles to most issues. (Alter Ego reached its 100th issue in March 2011, and has received an Eisner Award along the way.) TwoMorrows also published Schelly's own memoir of his time in fandom of the 1960s called Sense of Wonder: A Life in Comic Fandom (2001). Schelly wrote and published the biography Words of Wonder: The Life and Times of Otto Binder (2003), about the principal writer of The Marvel Family and many Superman comics of the 1950s and 1960s. This book was well received, and began the author’s historical research and writing on the history of comics in general. (It was re-issued in revised form in 2016 by North Atlantic Books, with a new title Otto Binder, The Life and Work of a Comic Book and Science Fiction Visionary.) Subsequently, he has written a dozen introductions for DC Archives books as well as the introduction for DCs Batman of the Forties. In 2004, Schelly visited Joe Kubert and The Kubert School in Dover, New Jersey, and wrote Man of Rock, a biography of Kubert. It was published in 2008, and was followed in 2011 by the publication of The Art of Joe Kubert, a coffee table book consisting of examples of Kubert’s best work from his 70-plus year career. Both were published by Fantagraphics Books. Schelly’s revised and expanded biography of Harry Langdon, Harry Langdon - His Life and Films, appeared in 2008, this time published by McFarland. When Comic-Con International established 2011 as the 50th anniversary of comics fandom, and made it a theme of their annual event in San Diego that year, Schelly was the catalyst for a fandom reunion which ended up being sponsored by the convention. Reunion 2011 drew some 140-plus members of fandom’s past. He appeared on three panels: Founders of Comic Fandom, Fanzines of Fandom’s Golden Age, and Spotlight on Bill Schelly. He received an Inkpot Award at Comic-Con 2011 for his efforts on behalf of fandom over the years. Schelly’s recent books are Weird Tales and Daring Adventures (2012), ''Alter Ego: The Best of the Classic Fanzine, Vol. 2 (2013) in collaboration with Roy Thomas, and the American Comic Book Chronicles: The 50’s'' (2013), which was nominated for a Harvey Award. His latest is Harvey Kurtzman, The Man Who Created Mad (2015), a biography of the originator of Mad (both the comic book and the magazine), Two-Fisted Tales, Frontline Combat, Trump, Humbug, and Help!, as well as Little Annie Fanny for Playboy. It won the Will Eisner Comic Industry Award for Best Comics-Related Book of 2015. In May 2017, Fantagraphics Books published Schelly's John Stanley, Giving Life to Little Lulu, a combined biography and coffee table book dedicated to Stanley's stellar work in comic books from 1942 to 1970. Next, North Atlantic Books will publish the author's memoir Sense of Wonder, My Life in Comic Fandom - The Whole Story in April 2018. It will include a re-written version of his 2001 book with almost the same title, and continue the original book from 1974, where it left off, to the present day.

Symptoms can include shortness of breath, chest pain, decreased ability to exercise, and an irregular heartbeat. The duration of problems can vary from hours to months. Complications may include heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrest. Myocarditis is most often due to a viral infection. Other causes include bacterial infections, certain medications, toxins, and autoimmune disorders. A diagnosis may be supported by an electrocardiogram (ECG), increased troponin, heart MRI, and occasionally a heart biopsy. An ultrasound of the heart is important to rule out other potential causes such as heart valve problems. Treatment depends on both the severity and the cause. Medications such as ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, and diuretics are often used. A period of no exercise is typically recommended during recovery. Corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be useful in certain cases. In severe cases an implantable cardiac defibrillator or heart transplant may be recommended. In 2013, about 1.5 million cases of acute myocarditis occurred. While people of all ages are affected, the young are most often affected. It is slightly more common in males than females. Most cases are mild. In 2015 cardiomyopathy, including myocarditis, resulted in 354,000 deaths up from 294,000 in 1990.

Horrobin believed that many diseases involve a lack of fatty acid precursors and might be alleviated by supplementing with the appropriate fatty acid. Horrobin's efforts focused on evening primrose oil, which contains gamma-linolenic acid. In the 1980s, Horrobin sold primrose oil in the United States without legally demonstrating its safety and efficacy, leading to government confiscations and felony indictments of his associates. Horrobin was later accused of withholding research data and suppressing the reports of scientists who questioned his claims. During Horrobin's tenure as chief executive, Scotia Pharmaceuticals obtained licences for several drugs based on evening primrose oil, but these licenses were withdrawn for lack of efficacy. Amidst charges of mismanagement and research fraud, Horrobin was ousted as CEO by a unanimous vote of the board and left the company in 1998. In 2001, Scotia, one of the first publicly traded biotechnology companies in the United Kingdom, also became the first to collapse. After Horrobin's departure from Scotia, he founded Laxdale Ltd., a company that investigated omega-3 fatty acids as possible treatments for schizophrenia and neurodegenerative diseases. Horrobin died of pneumonia as a complication of mantle cell lymphoma in 2003. Obituaries noted his contributions to the biotechnology industry, intellectual acumen, original thinking and adventurousness, while some criticised his promotion of primrose oil and other questionable claims.

He was king of Scotland from 1649 until his deposition in 1651, and king of England, Scotland and Ireland from the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 until his death. Charles II's father, Charles I, was executed at Whitehall on 30 January 1649, at the climax of the English Civil War. Although the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II king on 5 February 1649, England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth, and the country was a de facto republic, led by Oliver Cromwell. Cromwell defeated Charles II at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, and Charles fled to mainland Europe. Cromwell became virtual dictator of England, Scotland and Ireland, and Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France, the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands. A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy, and Charles was invited to return to Britain. On 29 May 1660, his 30th birthday, he was received in London to public acclaim. After 1660, all legal documents were dated as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649. Charles's English parliament enacted laws known as the Clarendon Code, designed to shore up the position of the re-established Church of England. Charles acquiesced to the Clarendon Code even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance. The major foreign policy issue of his early reign was the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In 1670, he entered into the Treaty of Dover, an alliance with his first cousin King Louis XIV of France. Louis agreed to aid him in the Third Anglo-Dutch War and pay him a pension, and Charles secretly promised to convert to Catholicism at an unspecified future date. Charles attempted to introduce religious freedom for Catholics and Protestant dissenters with his 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence, but the English Parliament forced him to withdraw it. In 1679, Titus Oates's revelations of a supposed \"Popish Plot\" sparked the Exclusion Crisis when it was revealed that Charles's brother and heir (James, Duke of York) was a Catholic. The crisis saw the birth of the pro-exclusion Whig and anti-exclusion Tory parties. Charles sided with the Tories, and, following the discovery of the Rye House Plot to murder Charles and James in 1683, some Whig leaders were executed or forced into exile. Charles dissolved the English Parliament in 1681, and ruled alone until his death on 6 February 1685. He was received into the Catholic Church on his deathbed. Charles was one of the most popular and beloved kings of England, known as the Merry Monarch, in reference to both the liveliness and hedonism of his court and the general relief at the return to normality after over a decade of rule by Cromwell and the Puritans. Charles's wife, Catherine of Braganza, bore no live children, but Charles acknowledged at least twelve illegitimate children by various mistresses. He was succeeded by his brother James.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"'The Miracle of Morgan's Creek' is a 1944 screwball comedy film written and directed by Preston Sturges, starring Eddie Bracken and Betty Hutton, and featuring Diana Lynn, William Demarest and Porter Hall.

Its chemical formula is 4  10  2, or HOCH 2 CH 2 SCH 2 CH 2 OH. It is miscible with acetone, alcohols, and chloroform. It is soluble in benzene, ether, and tetrachloromethane. Thiodiglycol is manufactured by reaction of 2-chloroethanol with sodium sulfide. It is structurally similar to diethylene glycol. Thiodiglycol has both polar and nonpolar solvent properties. It is used as a solvent in a variety of applications ranging from dyeing textiles to inks in some ballpoint pens. In chemical synthesis, it is used as a building block for protection products, dispersants, fibers, plasticizers, rubber accelerators, pesticides, dyes, and various other organic chemicals. In the manufacture of polymers, it is used as a chain transfer agent. As an antioxidant, it is used as an additive in lubricants. A relatively recent use (as of 2006) of thiodiglycol is as a mounting medium in microscopy. The ability to vary the refractive index of the medium by varying the concentration of TDE in an aqueous solution, plus its relative lack of toxicity makes it highly desirable for such use. The refractive index of the solution can be varied anywhere from near that of water (1.333) to that of glass (1.518). Thiodiglycol is a Chemical Weapons Convention schedule 2 chemical used in the production of sulfur-based blister agents such as mustard gas. Thiodiglycol is also a product of the hydrolysis of mustard gas. It can be detected in the urine of casualties.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Abram Efimovich Arkhipov (; &ndash; 25 September 1930) was a Russian realist artist, who was a member of the art collective The Wanderers as well as the Union of Russian Artists.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"RCAF Station Mossbank was home to No. 2 Bombing and Gunnery School, a Second World War British Commonwealth Air Training Plan training facility located near Mossbank, Saskatchewan, Canada.

The bridge originally passed over the East Fork of the White River on a former alignment of State Road 258, and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 25, 2005. The bridge was originally built in 1869. Built in two sections, the wood and iron bridge measured 325 feet long. It reflects a time when the construction of bridges began switching from wood to iron / steel, every tensile web in the trusses made of iron, every compression member made from wood. The now unusual use of both materials has made it said that the Bell Ford Bridge is \"the best representation of the American engineering “combination” bridge form\". Until 1970 it was regularly used by both cars and animals. The western span collapsed in February 1999 during a windstorm, and the eastern span collapsed on January 2, 2006, nine months after it made the National Register. Its collapse meant that no combination variant Post Truss remained standing worldwide. After the Bell Ford Bridge's January 2006 collapse, Jackson County Commission President Gary Darlage said: \"There is nothing left of the Bell Ford Bridge and I will not spend another tax dollar on it. Ninety percent of the people in this county think it is asinine to even consider rebuilding that bridge. On July 25, 2007, United States Representative Baron Hill announced that the National Historic Covered Bridge Preservation Program would be giving the Bell Ford Bridge and two other covered bridges in Jackson County $2.08 million total for restoration.  $448,000 of the grant was for the Bell Ford Bridge. On August 19, 2008, the commissioners of Jackson County voted 3-0 to sell what remained of the bridge to an interest group who intended to rebuild the bridge at Fort Benjamin Harrison State Park in Indianapolis, Indiana, over  away from its current location. It would allow walkers and bikers to cross over Fall Creek. The restoration is expected to take two years and cost $2 million (USD), with a hope that federal grants will be available. It has been promised that historical markers will denote its history in Jackson County, but some preservationists in Jackson County decry it being moved, saying the grant money was already there to pay for its renovation in Jackson County. One thing that might stop the bridge from being moved is if Jackson County would have to repay $123,000 of federal money for design and restoration work it received to use on the bridge since 1999. In late May 2010 an Indiana Department of Transportation representative requested of Jackson County commissioners that a decision be made in the coming month.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The following are the events in professional sumo during 1996.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Canoe Lake is a V-shaped lake in Kenora District, Ontario, Canada, just east of the border with Manitoba and south of Highway 17.

It was initially scheduled for the month of March, then delayed. In the August 2010 general election, the seat was won by independent candidate Jimmy \"Rasta\" Lusibaea, a former warlord during the ethnic unrest of 1999-2003. He was appointed Minister for Fisheries by new Prime Minister Danny Philip. Lusibaea lost his seat on 30 November 2010 upon being sentenced to two years and nine months in gaol for assault and grievous bodily harm, for events committed during the unrest. On 20 January 2011, the Minister for Police, James Tora, remitted Lusibaea's sentence to one month, using his discretion as Minister under section 38 of the Correctional Service Act. Consequently, Lusibaea was no longer barred from occupying his seat, and resumed his functions in Parliament. On 17 October, the High Court ruled that the remit did not amount to a court-sanctioned reduction in sentence, and Lusibaea lost his seat once more, necessitating a by-election. In early April 2012, the by-election having not yet been held, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Manasseh Maelanga explained that there was legal uncertainty as to whether Lusibaea could stand as a candidate. This was also affecting the scheduled by-election in East 'Are'are, in which MP Andrew Hanaria had lost his seat upon having been found to have bribed voters, but was seeking to stand for reelection. Maelanga stated that legal advice was being sought from the Attorney General, who was abroad, before a date for the two by-elections could be set. On 20 June, a date was finally announced for the by-election. The ten candidates were as follows. They included a former MP for the constituency, Danny Fa'afunua; and Fredrick Kwanairara, the 28-year-old son of former North Malaita MP Daniel Enele Kwanairara. Jimmy Lusibaea was \"barred from re-contesting the by-elections because he [was] still serving his sentence outside of prison\", but his wife, Vika Lusibaea, stood in his place. Vika Lusibaea won the seat by a large margin, becoming only the second ever woman to be elected to the National Parliament of Solomon Islands, following Hilda Kari in the 1990s. There was some slight controversy over her victory, critics drawing attention to the fact she was a Fiji-born naturalized citizen, and to her \"limited literacy skills\".

The report, published in the form of letters addressed to the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain and the Czechoslovak President, Edvard Beneš, on 21 September 1938, recommended the cession of the territory concerned to Nazi Germany, thus paving the way for the Munich Agreement of 30 September 1938.

The victims were five children aged between 10 and 17—Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans—at least four of whom were sexually assaulted. Two of the victims were discovered in graves dug on Saddleworth Moor; a third grave was discovered there in 1987, more than twenty years after Brady and Hindley's trial. The body of a fourth victim, Keith Bennett, is also suspected to be buried there, but despite repeated searches it remains undiscovered. The police were initially aware of only three killings, those of Edward Evans, Lesley Ann Downey and John Kilbride. The investigation was reopened in 1985, after Brady was reported in the press as having confessed to the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett. Brady and Hindley were taken separately to Saddleworth Moor to assist the police in their search for the graves, both by then having confessed to the additional murders. Characterised by the press as \"the most evil woman in Britain\", Hindley made several appeals against her life sentence, claiming she was a reformed woman and no longer a danger to society, but was never released. She died in 2002, aged 60. Brady was declared criminally insane in 1985 and confined in the high-security Ashworth Hospital.

In the Wilton Diptych (National Gallery, London), which is the earliest authentic contemporary portrait of an English king, Richard II wears a gold and enamelled white hart jewel, and even the angels surrounding the Virgin Mary all wear white hart badges. In English Folklore, the white hart is associated with Herne the Hunter. There are still many inns and pubs in England that sport a sign of the white hart, the fifth most popular name for a pub. Arthur C.

The two are normally police officers (cops), but some films, such as 48 Hrs. (a police officer and a convicted criminal), that are not about two officers may still be referred to as buddy cop films. It is a subgenre of buddy films. Frequently, although not always, the two heroes are of different ethnicity or cultures. However, regardless of ethnicity, the central difference is normally that one is \"wilder\" than the other: a hot-tempered iconoclast is paired with a more even-tempered partner. Often the \"wilder\" partner is the younger of the two, with the even-tempered partner having more patience and experience. These films sometimes also contain a variation on the good cop/bad cop motif, in which one partner is kinder and law-abiding, while the other is a streetwise, \"old school\" police officer who tends to break (or at least bend) the rules. Another frequent plot device of this genre is placing one of the partners in an unfamiliar setting (like a different city or foreign country) or role (like requiring police field work of a non-cop, rookie, or office-bound \"desk jockey\"). In these cases, they are usually guided by the other partner. In his review of Rush Hour, Roger Ebert coined the term \"Wunza Movie\" to describe this subgenre, a pun on the phrase \"One's a...\" that could be used to describe the contrasts between the two characters in a typical film. The cliché was satirized in the film Last Action Hero. While the movie in itself was a buddy cop film (i.e. pairing a fictional cop with a real world boy), the film's police department obligatorily assigned all cops a conflicting buddy to work with, even to the extreme of one officer being partnered with a cartoon cat. A subgenre of the buddy cop film is the buddy cop-dog movie, which teams a cop with a dog, but uses the same element of unlikely partnership to create comedic hijinks. Examples include Turner & Hooch, Top Dog and K-9.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Changzhi Medical College (长治医学院) is a university in Shanxi, People's Republic of China under the authority of the provincial government.
