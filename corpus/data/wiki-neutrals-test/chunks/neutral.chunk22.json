Quantization rules in earlier quantum field theory (QFT) frameworks resembled \"prescriptions\" or \"heuristics\" more than proofs, especially in non-abelian QFT, where the use of \"ghost fields\" with superficially bizarre properties is almost unavoidable for technical reasons related to renormalization and anomaly cancellation. The BRST global supersymmetry introduced in the mid-1970s  was quickly understood to rationalize the introduction of these Faddeev–Popov ghosts and their exclusion from \"physical\" asymptotic states when performing QFT calculations. Crucially, this symmetry of the path integral is preserved in loop order, and thus prevents introduction of counterterms which might spoil renormalizability of gauge theories. Work by other authors a few years later related the BRST operator to the existence of a rigorous alternative to path integrals when quantizing a gauge theory. Only in the late 1980s, when QFT was reformulated in fiber bundle language for application to problems in the topology of low-dimensional manifolds (topological quantum field theory), did it become apparent that the BRST \"transformation\" is fundamentally geometrical in character. In this light, \"BRST quantization\" becomes more than an alternate way to arrive at anomaly-cancelling ghosts. It is a different perspective on what the ghost fields represent, why the Faddeev–Popov method works, and how it is related to the use of Hamiltonian mechanics to construct a perturbative framework. The relationship between gauge invariance and \"BRST invariance\" forces the choice of a Hamiltonian system whose states are composed of \"particles\" according to the rules familiar from the canonical quantization formalism. This esoteric consistency condition therefore comes quite close to explaining how quanta and fermions arise in physics to begin with. In certain cases, notably gravity and supergravity, BRST must be superseded by a more general formalism, the Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Bond University Rugby Club is an Australian rugby union football club that competes in the Queensland Premier Rugby competition.

The Little Sunset Speedway is a 1/5th mile dirt kart racing track aimed at family racing entertainment. Built as a scale replica of the former Sunset Speedway in Omaha, Nebraska, the track is the entry to dirt track racing for young drivers looking to make their way up the ladder of short track motorsports. Several of the drivers who regularly race at the I-80 Speedway, began their careers at The Little Sunset Speedway. Several special events at the kart track are also part of the season. History Originally built in 1994 as I-80 Speedway under the ownership of Omaha businessman and race fan Rich Bellino, the track was sold in 2001 to Sioux City, Iowa businessman Ted Carlson, who also owned Park Jefferson Speedway in Jefferson, South Dakota. The facility was renamed The Nebraska Raceway Park. At the time of the sale, Craig Kelley was hired as the general manager. Kelley was the former owner and general manager of the recently closed Sunset Speedway in Omaha. Subsequently, Kelley took with him the NASCAR sanctioning that Sunset Speedway had enjoyed since 1982. At this time, the pit area was moved to inside the dirt oval, as opposed to the former pit area located outside turn one since the facilities inception. The former pit area was repurposed for additional spectator parking. In 2004, Carlson sold the entire facility to a group of race drivers who had enjoyed their careers at several race tracks throughout the Plains. The new ownership group included The Kosiski brothers, Joe, Steve, and Ed. As well as John Schwartz, and Mike Merrill. When the new owners took over the facility, the day before the start of the 2004 racing season, plans had been put into motion to upgrade the entire facility and improve the fan experience. For 2005, a Motocross facility was added, called the Soaring Edge Motocross Park, and The Little Sunset Speedway was added. Also new was a name change for the facility. The entire facility was named Nebraska Raceway Park, but each separate venue had its own identity. The 4/10th's mile dirt track was renamed The I-80 Speedway, throwing back to its original name from 1994. Several private decks were added to the bleacher sections of the main grandstands to give fans who purchased the deck space, a guaranteed seat at all events at the I-80 Speedway. A children's play area was also constructed just to the Southeast side of the main grandstands. Concession areas were also upgraded and modernized. New handicapped accessible seating areas were constructed to better serve fans with disabilities. In 2010, the Soaring Edge Motocross Park was closed due to lack of attendance and operating costs, and the land repurposed for SCCA RallyCross events. The I-80 Speedway has played host to several special events since its inception, including the ARCA Series event in 1995, one of only 4 dirt track events that year, and the only on a track shorter than 1 mile, for the ARCA series. Also playing host to the Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series, World of Outlaws sprint cars, USMTS modifieds, the UMP Summernationals for Super Late Models, the Lucas Oil ASCS sprint cars, the now defunct NASCAR O'Reilly's All Star Series for Late Models (formerly the NASCAR Busch All-Star Tour)the now defunct World Dirt Racing League (WDRL) Super Late Models, the Lucas Oil Midwest Late Model Racing Association (MLRA), the National Championship Racing Association [NCRA] sprint cars and late models, the now defunct Topless Outlaw Racing Association (TORA), as well as several other forms of motorsports including flat track motorcycle racing and monster truck racing. NASCAR stars Several NASCAR Sprint Cup drivers have also made appearances at the facility. Kyle Petty, during his charity motorcycle ride, made a stop on his tour in 2002, with drivers Steve Park, and Ken Schrader. Kenny Wallace, Carl Edwards, and Clint Bowyer have also made appearances at the venue. Carl Edwards was injured while driving a Super Late Model at the track which led to Edwards needing a relief driver at the next NASCAR Sprint Cup event. Edwards broke his hand when he was involved in a multi-car crash on the back straight of I-80 Speedway. Tragedy Tragedy struck the facility in September 1999 when World of Outlaws sprint car driver, Kevin Gobrecht, died of his injuries sustained in a crash at the track during the World of Outlaws feature event. His death remains the only at the facility in its 21 years of operation. Extreme sports stars Former AMA Supercross Lites Champion, freestyle motocross rider and all around Extreme sports star, Travis Pastrana made an appearance in 2009 for the taping of his extreme reality TV show, Nitro Circus. Pastrana and his band of extreme sports stars drove Dirt Late Models in an exhibition race pitting them against some of the regular drivers at I-80 Speedway. Pastrana played a part in a mock \"fight\" between himself and local driver Kortney Kosiski. Pastrana spun out Kosiski on the track during the race, and she decided to enact a little revenge by seeking out Pastrana after the race and feigned an attack while Pastrana was unbuckling from the car he was driving. For the remainder of the event, Pastrana was known as the guy who had to be protected from the girl racer. Continuing the tradition I-80 Speedway will open its 21st year of continuous operation in April 2015, once again featuring the dare devils of the area and perpetuating the dreams of stock car stardom for young drivers in the state of Nebraska.

The missile was known as the \"RB-304\" during development and early service years. While interest in guided anti-ship missiles was subdued in the 1950s, it was not entirely extinct. In 1949, the Swedish government placed a request for a radar-guided, air-launched anti-ship missile. The request materialized as the SAAB \"Robot-Byrån (RB) 04\", which was first test launched by a Saab 29 Tunnan fighter in early 1955. The early versions of the missile suffered teething problems in regards to the two targeting modes, which were area attack, for striking a big group of ships (like an invasion fleet), and select targeting, where the missiles home in on a single vessel. In the area attack the missile would only target a ship in the group if they were within 1,000 meters of another vessel, this was also in the early electronic age, and changes in this distance required hardware modifications in a workshop. Many components of the missile were reused when the RBS-15 was developed, including the main body and warhead, although the motor and main wings were the most obvious external changes. The missile has never seen combat; the closest thing it has come to being used was during the \"Whiskey on the Rocks\" incident in 1981, when a Soviet (NATO code Whiskey Class) submarine ran aground outside the naval station in Karlskrona. Swedish AJ37 Viggens with RB-04E's mounted under their wings, taken from top secret storage bunkers, stood on high alert for a possible Soviet incursion. On one occasion, when a Soviet rescue operation seemed to be underway, aircraft were scrambled with the intent to intercept Soviet ships.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"CPR Regeneration was an Urban Regeneration Company set up to help redevelop Camborne, Pool and Redruth in Cornwall, England, UK.

Elephant flows, though not numerous, can occupy a disproportionate share of the total bandwidth over a period of time. It is not clear who coined \"elephant flow\", but the term began occurring in published Internet network research in 2001 when the observations were made that a small number of flows carry the majority of Internet traffic and the remainder consists of a large number of flows that carry very little Internet traffic (mice flows). For example, researchers Mori et al. studied the traffic flows on several Japanese universities and research networks. At the WIDE network they found elephant flows were only 4.7% of all flows but occupied 41.3% of all data transmitted during the time period. The actual impact of elephant flows on Internet traffic is still an area of research and debate. Some research shows that elephant flows may be highly correlated with traffic spikes and other elephant flows (Lan & Heidemann and Mori et al.). Elephant flows have varying definitions proposed by researchers including flows that occupy greater than 1% of total traffic in a time period, measuring the duration of the flow, and looking at flows whose size is greater than the mean plus three standard deviations of traffic during the time period. One of the main goals of research into elephant flows is to develop more efficient bandwidth management tools and predictive models for the Internet. For example, researchers have focused on providing better quality of service to flows of small sizes (mice flows) by de-prioritizing elephant flows.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Peroxisomal biogenesis factor 19 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PEX19 gene.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Retiers (, Gallo: Restier) is a commune in the Ille-et-Vilaine department of Brittany in northwestern France.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Winding Stair is a musical group from Belfast, Northern Ireland which first played publicly in 2005.

He was born in Adelaide, South Australia, and initially played classical percussion in the Adelaide Conservatorium of Music, before teaching himself the guitar. In 1967 Peek formed a Psychedelic pop, progressive rock group, James Taylor Move but left by May 1968, moving to London. He returned to Adelaide, Australia, to join a newly formed rock band Quartet which, despite a contract from England's Decca Records, proved artistically unsuccessful. An Australian single \"Now\"/\"Will My Lady Come\" [Decca Y-8977] was released in 1969. The A-side is credited to Britten; the B-side to Spencer, Tarney and Peek. For a time, following their move to London, he and his fellow Adelaide-born bandmates—guitarist Terry Britten, bassist Alan Tarney, and drummer Trevor Spencer—made their livings as session musicians together, playing with everyone from the New Seekers and Mary Hopkin (Earth Song, Ocean Song) to Cliff Richard, whose regular backing band they became on stage and on record during the 1970s. Peek also worked with Manfred Mann, Lulu, Tom Jones, Jeff Wayne (War of the Worlds), and Shirley Bassey, among others. He wrote the music for the internationally broadcast \"Singapore Girl\" television advertisements for Singapore Airlines. In 1979, he joined the classical/progressive rock quintet Sky. In association with classical guitarist John Williams, keyboardist Francis Monkman, bassist Herbie Flowers, and drummer Tristan Fry, Peek played on seven studio albums with the band, before departing in 1985. Peek recorded three albums—Guitar Junction, Awakening, and Life & Other Games— but achieved greater prominence through his work with Sky and his session work with Olivia Newton-John, Kiki Dee, Sally Oldfield, the Alan Parsons Project, and the London Symphony Orchestra (in association with Francis Monkman on their Symphonic Rock: British Invasion releases). He also played on various soundtracks, including Monkman's music for The Long Good Friday. Following a failed business venture and bankruptcy, in 2010 he was prosecuted in Perth, Western Australia on two counts of making a false statement to deceive or defraud. A full trial was originally scheduled for 2011, later adjourned until 2012 and ultimately never took place.

Open to contributions from October 10, 2006 to November 8, 2006, the Time Capsule also hoped to capture the thoughts and feelings of the world in 2006 as an exercise in electronic or \"digital anthropology\". At the time of the closing of the capsule, the total number of submissions was 170,857. The highest number of contributions, (32,910) came from the 20-29 age group. Although originally slated to be produced at the Pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacan, Mexico, Mexican authorities have denied Yahoo permission fearing damage to the ancient historical site. Instead the 2006 Yahoo! Time Capsule culminated in a celebrated production on the Jemez Pueblo in New Mexico. The 18-hour live event spanned the evenings of October 25, 26, and 27th and featured the projection of giant digital images of Time Capsule submissions onto an ancient red rock cliff on the reservation. Each night opened with traditional dancing and music by the people of Jemez Pueblo, set in front of the immense projections and lighting that could be seen for miles through the desert. Recordings of international folk music provided by Smithsonian Folkways Recordings accompanied the live global webcast. The Time Capsule event was designed and produced by Environmental Media Artist, Marc Herring, of Herring Media Group Inc. and featured the projection and display engineering services of Quince Imaging, Inc. The Time Capsule closed on November 8, 2006, after which the digital collection of submissions was entrusted to Smithsonian Folkways Recordings based in Washington D.C., where it will remain until Yahoo!'s 25th Birthday in 2020.

It is customary for people to eat sardines in that week, baked with the typical Broa de Avintes, a type of corn bread made in the nearby village of Avintes. There is plenty of fireworks too. During religious processions people carry the images of saints, sometimes in real size, for other people to worship and make offerings to the saints. People usually dress in their traditional fishermen and fisherwomen clothes to pay respect for their patron saint, Peter. Other popular saints include Our Lady the Virgin Mary, Our Lady of Fátima, Our Lady of Carmo, and St. Michael the Archangel, images of which are placed at the centre of the village.

Since troubadour poetry probably originated in northwest Aquitaine (Poitou and Saintonge) and first spread&mdash;within a generation&mdash;south into Gascony, Peire was one of the earliest troubadours. Only two of his poems survive, one canso (\"Vezer volgra n'Ezelgarda\" ) and one cobla (\"Qui qu'Amors don son voler\" ). His birthplace was Valera, near Podensac and Saint-Macaire in the Gironde. His vida places his birthplace in the fief of Arnaut Guillem de Marsan, who was himself a troubadour. He was a contemporary of Marcabru and originally a jongleur. His poems were typical for the time, according to Uc de Saint Circ, the probable author of his vida, being about natural objects (like leaves, flowers, and birds), but not of great value to the biographer's time. But Uc saves his harshest critique for the end, as Elizabeth Poe relates: The unexpected afterthough, one of the factors contributing to the humor of the sentence ... is another typical device of Uc's style. He catches us off guard with this tactic at the end of the short vida about Peire de Valeira, for example, which he concludes with the harsh judgement: Sei cantar non aguen gran valor \"His songs did not have much value\" . . .and just when we think he has completed his devastating critique, he adds ni el \"and neither did he.\" Peire's entire vida, found in MSS I and K, however, is probably unreliable, since it appears to confuse him with another Gascon troubadour, Arnaut de Tintinhac. Peire is often placed in a hypothetical \"school\" of poetry which includes Bernart de Ventadorn, Cercamon, Jaufre Rudel, Marcabru, Marcoat, and Peire Rogier among others. Further, the references in his vida to songs of the time concerning leaves, flowers, songs, and birds may be evidence for an early troubadour genre which did not survive. It may also be that the distinctiveness of Peire's genre was regional, a Gascon style. The later Gascon troubadour Guiraut de Calanso wrote verses that were ''d'aquella saison (\"of that time\") and disliked in Provence, perhaps pointing to a Gascon tradition (or \"literary fad\") which was not popular outside of Gascoigna'' (Gascony). The paubra valor (\"poor value\") of Peire's songs may be a reflection of the popularity of Gascon influence.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"AT&T Inc. began its history as Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, which was a subsidiary of the Bell Telephone Company founded by Alexander Graham Bell in 1880.

Other Delphinium species may be called tall larkspur, such as Delphinium barbeyi. D. exaltatum is native to the central and eastern United States, where it can be found in Kentucky, Maine, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, and Missouri. This plant is a perennial herb producing a stem up to 2 meters tall from a long, thick taproot. The base of the stem may have a reddish tinge and it is free of leaves by the time the plant blooms. The leaves are somewhat circular or pentagonal in outline and are divided into a few wedge-shaped lobes. The leaf blade is borne on a petiole up to 15 centimeters long. Flowering occurs between July and September. The inflorescence is a raceme of up to 30 flowers. The sepals are any shade of dull blue to purple or lavender, or occasionally white. The fruit is a follicle roughly a centimeter long. This species occupies wooded areas and prairie habitat and tolerates sunny and shady areas. It grows on slopes facing most any direction. The substrate is often rocky, with calcareous stone such as limestone, sometimes with chert. It may grow on amphibolite or diabase. It withstands an amount of disturbance and can persist in disturbed habitat remnants such as road cuts, ditches, fence rows, and fields. Associated plant species include upland boneset (Eupatorium sessilifolium) and staghorn sumac (Rhus typhina) in Maryland, barren strawberry (Waldsteinia fragarioides), fourleaf milkweed (Asclepias quadrifolia), eastern leatherwood (Dirca palustris), and prairie trillium (Trillium recurvatum) in Missouri, upland bentgrass (Agrostis perennans), orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata), mountain oatgrass (Danthonia compressa), Philadelphia lily (Lilium philadelphicum), timothy-grass (Phleum pratense), three-toothed cinquefoil (Sibbaldiopsis tridentata), and self-heal (Prunella vulgaris) in North Carolina, eastern green violet (Hybanthus concolor), American bladdernut (Staphylea trifolia), and yellow horse gentian (Triosteum angustifolium) in Pennsylvania, and barrelhead gayfeather (Liatris cylindracea), Chinese bushclover (Lespedeza cuneata), smooth aster (Symphyotrichum laeve), eastern smooth beardtongue (Penstemon laevigatus), downy skullcap (Scutellaria incana), and hoary puccoon (Lithospermum canescens) in Tennessee. Like most other Delphinium species, this plant is toxic, containing several poisonous alkaloids. Every part of the plant is poisonous, especially the seeds. This species can be found in many places across the eastern half of the United States and there are over 100 occurrences; however, most occurrences are small, with no more than 50 individuals. The main threat to the species is habitat loss. Agriculture and development has consumed habitat. Fire suppression is also a threat; the loss of a natural fire regime has allowed overgrowth and encroachment of competing vegetation, pushing this native plant out. Livestock causes habitat disturbance, such as soil compaction, in some areas. Road building, quarrying, and logging are factors. Pesticide use can reduce populations of the essential insect pollinators of this species. While the plant can tolerate some disturbance, as evidenced by its ability to thrive along roadsides, it cannot withstand habitat destruction. Management activities for the conservation of this species include controlled burns and other vegetation-clearing methods. Insect pollinators should be protected. The habitat should be preserved, with no logging, grazing, road construction, or other destructive forces. Transplanting propagated individuals into the habitat has been successful.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Clifton is a historic home and farm located near Rixeyville, Culpeper County, Virginia.

It was followed by a second rear guard action near the same location on the night of April 5, 1865 and morning of April 6, 1865 during the Union Army pursuit of the Confederate forces (Army of Northern Virginia and Richmond local defense forces) which were fleeing westward after the fall of Petersburg and Richmond, Virginia at the Third Battle of Petersburg (sometimes shown as the Breakthrough at Petersburg) on April 2, 1865. The actions took place just prior to the Battle of Sailor's Creek (sometimes shown as \"Sayler's Creek\") on April 6, 1865. That battle would be the last major engagement between the Union Army under the overall direction of Union General-in-Chief, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, and General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia before that Confederate army's surrender at Appomattox Court House, Virginia on April 9, 1865. On April 5, 1865, Confederate cavalry under the command of Brig. Gen. Martin Gary, reinforced by cavalry from the divisions of Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Rosser and Colonel Thomas T. Munford, which were under the overall command of Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee, counterattacked a brigade of Union cavalry led by Brig. Gen. Henry E. Davies, Jr.. Davies's brigade was part of the division commanded by Maj. Gen. George Crook, which in turn was under the overall command of Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan. Davies's force was returning from a scout during which they burned Confederate wagons in the vicinity of Paineville, Virginia (Paineville area of Amelia County, Virginia), about north of Jetersville, Virginia. The wagons were carrying supplies and equipment for the Army of Northern Virginia. The running fight after the Paineville action started north of Amelia Springs and continued through Amelia Springs almost to Jetersville, Virginia on the South Side Railroad. Jetersville, which was southwest of Amelia Court House, Virginia where Lee's forces were concentrating, had been held by Sheridan's forces since the day before. The battle was inconclusive in that the Confederate forces had to return to Amelia Springs when Davies's troops were able to join with other Union forces as they approached Jetersville. During the night of April 5, 1865, Union Army divisions under the command of Brig. Gen. Nelson A. Miles and Maj. Gen. Gershom Mott fought a minor and inconclusive action against the Army of Northern Virginia rear guard commanded by Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon near Amelia Springs. Although casualties for both sides in both engagements have been stated to be light and about even at less than 250 combined, the Union commanders reported suffering 158 casualties. The Confederates presumably suffered fewer than 100. In addition, Davies's men took over 300 Confederate prisoners in the Paineville action immediately preceding the counterattack which precipitated the running battle through and beyond Amelia Springs almost to Jetersville.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Mike Esposito (July 14, 1927 – October 24, 2010), who sometimes used the pseudonyms Mickey Demeo, Mickey Dee, Michael Dee, and Joe Gaudioso, was an American comic book artist whose work for DC Comics, Marvel Comics and others spanned the 1950s to the 2000s.

In its upper course the river flows towards the north in a narrow bed with a very shallow gradient, resulting in the fact that it meanders significantly. All of its major affluents join it from the west and all of them start from karst springs. At Dragatuš it is joined by its major tributary Podturnščica Creek, and at Črnomelj by Dobličica Creek. From the outflow of Podturnščica Creek the bed of the Lahinja is narrow and up to 20 m deep, with numerous bends. At the vicinity of one of them stands Gradac Castle. From Črnomelj to Gradac the river has no surface affluents, but below Gradac it is joined by the high-volume and faster-flowing Krupa. After its confluence with the Krupa, the Lahinja turns towards the east. It joins the Kolpa at Primostek. The Lahinja's river basin is asymmetric because it receives the majority of its surface affluents from the right side. It is a part of the Sava Basin.

Some disgrunted Kashmiri nobles were often pushing Akbar to annex Kashmir. Yousuf Shah Chak sought refuge in Sialkot, before he was brought to Delhi for talks with Akbar. Akbar's forces betrayed Yousuf, and imprisoned him for the rest of his life. It is narrated that Habba Khatoon, Yousuf's love interest and a well known poetess of Kashmir, had opposed Yousuf's travel to Delhi, for she sensed Akbar's offer as a bait. She later made mentions of this in her writings. Chaks were a naturalized Kashmiri tribe of dardic ancestry from Gurez. They successfully resisted the attempts of Babur and Himayun to annex Kashmir.

He played drums for the heavy metal band CRYSTAL PRIDE in the early 1980s. In the 2000s, Lindström became a household name in Sweden through his documentary series Värsta språket about the Swedish language at Sveriges Television. The series achieved top ratings because of Lindström's personable and entertaining approach to the information presented to viewers. Lindström has written several books that served as a basis for the series as well as historic linguistics in the Swedish language. They have the same kind of approach, mixing informality with information derived from the author's linguistics background. Lindström's first encounter with the Swedish audience was on the radio show Hassan, on which he made prank calls to random people pretending to be different imaginary people, often with some kind of subtle disturbance that made the conversation farcical. The show aired on P3 for several seasons in the 1990s. Since 2010, he has taken Björn Hellberg's role as the referee, in one of the most popular Television-Quizzes in Sweden ever, På spåret, which largely is a contest in geography, but also includes history, linguistics, sports and various subjects.

The first period saw the ongoing building of nuclear power plants, the enactment of numerous pieces of legislation such as the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, and the implementation of countless policies which have guided the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy in the regulation and growth of nuclear energy companies. This includes, but is not limited to, regulations of nuclear facilities, waste storage, decommissioning of weapons-grade materials, uranium mining, and funding for nuclear companies, along with an increase in power plant building. Both legislation and bureaucratic regulations of nuclear energy in the United States have been shaped by scientific research, private industries' wishes, and public opinion, which has shifted over time and as a result of different nuclear disasters. In the United States, there have been numerous legislative actions and policies implemented on a federal and state level to both regulate atomic energy and promote its expansion. Growth of nuclear power in the US ended in the 1980s, however the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was passed in 2005 which aimed to jump start the nuclear industry through financial loan-guarantees for expansion and re-outfitting of nuclear plants. The success of this legislation is still undetermined, since all 17 companies that applied for funding are still in the planning phases on their 26 proposed building applications. Some of the proposed sites have even scrapped their building plans, and many think the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster further dampen the success of expansion of nuclear energy in the United States. In 2008, the Energy Information Administration projected almost 17 gigawatts of new nuclear power reactors by 2030, but in its 2011 projections, it \"scaled back the 2030 projection to just five\". Following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, public support for building nuclear power plants in the U.S. dropped to 43%, slightly lower than it was immediately after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, according to a CBS News poll. A survey conducted in April 2011 found that 64 percent of Americans opposed the construction of new nuclear reactors.

In Kramer's 1997 autobiography, describing how he formed his first production company in the late 1940s, he called Glass \"one of the best publicity men in town\", and remarked \"I was fortunate to get Glass, with whom I had worked in the Lewin-Loew partnership before the war. He was a bright man and a very smooth operator.\" In a 1973 biography of Marlon Brando, Bob Thomas wrote: George Glass was a veteran of movie publicity, but he was more than a publicist for Kramer. He, Kramer and Carl Foreman were partners in the independent film company, and Glass's brilliant campaigns for Champion and Home of the Brave had been a major part of the company's success. A short, stubby, ebullient man, he performed his craft on the basis of telling the truth. Glass began his career in the entertainment industry as a radio news commentator and sports broadcaster, but left radio for films in 1936 to work in advertising and publicity capacities for Samuel Goldwyn, United Artists, and others. With Kramer's company, in addition to being the head publicist, Glass often acted as associate producer, sometimes uncredited (as for High Noon ), and sometimes with screen credit (as for Cyrano de Bergerac and The Men ). Other productions from this period include Death of a Salesman and The Wild One, for which Glass suggested the title. In January 1952, Glass testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. In his testimony, he described attending gatherings at the homes of Ring Lardner, Jr. and other members of the entertainment industry in the mid-1940s, at which he was urged to become a member of the Communist Political Association. In 1956, Glass and Walter Seltzer started a freelance publicity organization, described in the press as a collaboration of \"two of the most experienced and able drum beaters\" in Hollywood. After Brando formed his own production company, Pennebaker Productions, Glass and Seltzer joined him as executive producers, and together they turned out a number of films including Shake Hands with the Devil, The Naked Edge, Paris Blues and One-Eyed Jacks. Glass was elected to the executive board of the Screen Producers Guild in 1960, along with Mervyn LeRoy. He continued to work with Kramer for many years as an associate producer, with additional credits including ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, The Secret of Santa Vittoria, Bless the Beasts and Children and R. P. M.'' Glass is credited by several sources with originating the witticism, \"An actor is a kind of guy who if you ain't talking about him  ain't listening.\"   (That line has also been attributed to Brando, who reportedly heard it from Glass and quoted it many times. )","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"David E.

It replaced the M1952 rucksack (FSN 8465-261-6831) and was in turn replaced by the ALICE in 1973. The 1967 Training Circular TC 10-8. Lightweight Rucksack: Nylon OG106 served as a \"how to use\" manual. Its ensemble consisted of a nylon pack with a cinch cord, top flap and three exterior pockets and a tubular aluminum frame with padded shoulder straps and waist belt. The Lightweight Rucksack, Nylon, OG106 (FSN 8465-782-3248) was developed in 1962 as a part of the United States Army's efforts to develop suitable equipment for use by Special Forces, long-range reconnaissance patrols, and mountain and arctic troops. Testing was conducted by the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) in Alaska and Panama Canal Zone. Four different patterns of the lightweight rucksack exist, with the latter two models featuring attachment points which allow the pack itself to be mounted in two and three different locations on the frame, respectively. A prototype rucksack was produced in 1962, featuring a welded frame. The 1964 model was virtually the same, but with the contract information stamped in the pack rather than sewn in on a label. The next improvement came along in 1965, when the frame was changed to a riveted version rather than a welded one. The last modification was made in 1968, with the addition of a middle horizontal back strap. In South Vietnam the lightweight rucksack replaced and augmented the M1956 and M1961 versions of combat packs and was later partially replaced by the tropical rucksack of the M1967 MLCE (Designed specifically for jungle warfare). The rucksack was typically mounted low on the frame allowing bulky equipment to be strapped above. Stocks of lightweight rucksacks were replaced in United States military service beginning in 1974 with the adoption of the ALICE equipment. Lightweight rucksacks are currently quite desirable among collectors and period reenactors alike, and often retail for anywhere between $250 and $350 USD at dedicated militaria dealers and online auctions.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Cobalt(II) naphthenate is a mixture of cobalt(II) derivatives of naphthenic acids. These coordination complexes are widely used as oil drying agents for the autoxidative crosslinking of drying oils. Metal naphthenates are not well defined in conventional chemical sense that they are mixtures. They are widely employed catalysts because they are soluble in the nonpolar substrates, such as the alkyd resins or linseed oil. The fact that naphthenates are mixtures helps to confer high solubility. A second virtue of these species is their low cost. A well-defined compound that exhibits many of the properties of cobalt naphthenate is the cobalt(II) complex of 2-ethylhexanoic acid. Often in technical literature, naphthenates are described as salts, but they are probably also non-ionic coordination complexes with structures similar to basic zinc acetate. The catalytic properties of cobalt(II) naphthenates are similar to those of related compounds containing manganese and iron. Such species are sometimes classified as ''active driers.\" Active driers are catalysts that feature redox-active metal centers.

This is illustrated in Figure 1 showing three fractal patterns. When rotated 90°, the first two fairly homogeneous patterns do not appear to change, but the third more heterogeneous figure does change and has correspondingly higher lacunarity. The earliest reference to the term in geometry is usually attributed to Mandelbrot, who, in 1983 or perhaps as early as 1977, introduced it as, in essence, an adjunct to fractal analysis. Lacunarity analysis is now used to characterize patterns in a wide variety of fields and has application in multifractal analysis in particular (see Applications).","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Albert Victor George Wolton (12 June 1919 – 9 September 1990) was an English cricketer.

The elliptic spring consisted of steel plates piled on top of one another and pinned together; it is the same method still used in rear suspensions. His invention was a major breakthrough in carriage design and it inspired a boom in the construction and sale of lightweight private carriages. Ultimately, there was greater investment in roads and the beginnings of a national network. Travel by road until the 19th century was done on foot or on horseback. Other than local carts, goods were transported by pack animal. There was little if any investment in the roads which were nothing more than rough tracks or, at best, the remains of Roman roads. Any carriages and carts were forced by rough surfaces to go at a horse's walking pace only. Elliott's invention ensured stability and carriage travel became safe with a much smoother ride, subject to road repair and maintenance. Elliott died at Plaistow in 1868 aged 75 and was buried with other members of his family at St Georges Church, Beckenham, Kent. He had married twice and had 12 children. On his death his estate comprised at least 5 large houses, 2 carriage workshops and a half share of the prosperous Westminster carriage firm of Elliott and Holbrook.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"This article presents lists of literary events and publications in 1826.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Bong Load Records is an independent record label originally based in Los Angeles which was started by Tom Rothrock and founded by producers Tom Rothrock, Rob Schnapf and partner Bradshaw Lambert.
