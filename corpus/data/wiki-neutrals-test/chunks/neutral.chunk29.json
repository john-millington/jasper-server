Wood attended the King's court at Oxford in 1643, during the First English Civil War, and was knighted there on 16 April 1644. In that year he accompanied the Queen, Henrietta Maria, to France, as Treasurer of her Household, an office he retained till his death. He compounded on 31 May 1649 and was fined £273 by Cromwell's authority on 15 June 1649. In about 1657 he was created a baronet by Charles II, when in exile.

Eldest daughter of King Charles IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma, she was married in May 1785 aged 10 with Infante John, Lord of the Infantado and Duke of Beja, second son of Queen Maria I of Portugal, in an attempt to cement ties between the Kingdoms of Spain and Portugal. Detested by the Portuguese court —where she was called \"the Harpy de Queluz\" (pt: a Megera de Queluz)— Carlota Joaquina also gradually won the antipathy of the people, who accused her of promiscuity and influence her husband in favor of the interests of the Spanish crown. After the escape of the Portuguese court to Brazil, Carlota Joaquina began conspiring against her husband, claiming that he had no mental capacity to govern Portugal and its possessions, thus wanting to establish a regency. Ambitious, she also planned to usurp the Spanish crown that was in the hands of Napoleon's brother Joseph Bonaparte. After the marriage in 1817 of her son Pedro with the Archduchess Leopoldina of Austria and the later return of the royal family to Portugal in 1821, Carlota Joaquina was confined in the Royal Palace of Queluz, where she died alone and abandoned by her children on 7 January 1830.

Based on the author's personal diary and covering the entire period of World War I from 1914 to 1918, the book is a memoir of the experiences of a Hungarian cavalry officer of the Blue Hussars of the Imperial army of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. The book provides an uncommon perspective on the war as it is written by a well-educated, multi-lingual, Hungarian officer serving in multiple fronts. Though battles and combat feature throughout, the main focus is on the author's personal life. The war serves as a backdrop to a man of high birth in a society struggling to adapt to the modern world. The portrait provided of war on the eastern front is starkly different from that of the western front described in novels such as Le Feu (Under Fire). Antiquated militaria such as cavalry regiments are only eliminated near the end of the war period. The memoir presents a fairly positive view of the author's service. Written in a different time period, it could easily have passed for pro-war propaganda. Parts of the author's diary were used as such during the war period by the Hungarian government. For most of the novel, the view of the war is a positive one and the author's personal experiences harken back to the romantic and idealistic notions of war.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Computing Centre of Complutense University of Madrid was created on 1966-01-13 after an agreement established between the University and IBM.

Feathers, yarns, and furs are all used, some of the most popular being peacock feathers, chicken down and neck feathers, and black wool. Some flies are even tied with thin copper wire to add extra weight so flies can sink in fast moving mountain waters. These flies are mainly used in the Maenikko Ashio ( まえにっこ足尾) area. Many flies are tied in “reverse hackle” meaning the hackle of the fly fans forward towards the eye of the hook instead of down the hook. In Japanese this is referred to as a “Sakasakebari (さかさけばり)” fly. Some rare flies used in the Okumino Itoshiro (お組の意図白尾) area even have down feathers incorporated in their design. These flies are not known to float well, so instead they are mainly used as wet flies for shallow waters. Japanese’s flies are mainly tied to represent an insect that is common to an area instead of replicating insects. Americans focus more on details in their flies so the fly is a similar to the real thing as possible. The Japanese instead use materials with colors that could represent a large range of insects. Although this is a large difference between both arts of fly tying, both have been very effective in catching fish. Japanese fly designs are even used to fish many types of trout.

Humans may become infected with hantaviruses through contact with rodent urine, saliva, or feces. Some strains cause potentially fatal diseases in humans, such as hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), also known as hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) while others have not been associated with known human disease. HPS (HCPS) is a \"rare respiratory illness associated with the inhalation of aerosolized rodent excreta (urine and feces) contaminated by hantavirus particles.\" Human infections of hantaviruses have almost entirely been linked to human contact with rodent excrement; in 2005 human-to-human transmission of the Andes virus has been reported in South America.

Until 1939 the unit was commanded by Gen.bryg. Józef Kustroń and was stationed in and around the towns of Nowy Sącz, Bielsko, Cieszyn, Bogumin, Kraków. Along with 11th Infantry and 22nd Mountain Infantry Divisions, the 21st was notable for its distinctive uniforms, based on folk attire of the Gorals (Polish highlanders) rather than standard uniforms of the Polish Army. During the Invasion of Poland, the division was attached to Bielsko Operational Group of the Kraków Army. It defended the line of Cieszyn-Bogumin in the region of Zaolzie. Following the steady withdrawal eastwards, it was victorious in the battles of Krzywoczka and Mogilany along the Dunajec. Attacked on September 6 by superior forces of the German 2nd Panzer Division and German 4th Panzer Division, parts of its shielding forces managed to withdraw to the other side of the river, blowing the bridges in Bobrowniki up. At the same time, a major part of the division was assaulted prior to the river crossing and had to withdraw northwards, where it joined with the Polish 6th Infantry Division near the town of Biskupice.

Introduced around the start of 1971, it was based on Sharp's preceding QT-8D and QT-8B compact desktop calculators and used the same logic circuits, but it was redesigned to fit in a much smaller case. Most electronic calculators before the EL-8 were intended for desktop use. Sharp's predecessor to the EL-8, the battery-powered QT-8B, was just a portable version of a compact desk calculator. The EL-8 was much smaller, small enough to be used in one's hand: long,  wide, and  thick, and weighing  with batteries. Although it was still too bulky to easily fit in a pocket, it was an important step toward the development of the pocket calculator. The EL-8's original price in Japan was 84,800 Japanese yen. The U.S. retail price in 1971 was $345, equivalent to about $1,850 in 2010. The operation and performance of the EL-8 are identical to its predecessor calculators, the QT-8D and QT-8B, because its logic circuits use the same set of four Rockwell-manufactured large-scale integrated circuits. Likewise, its keyboard has the same layout, including the combined key,  and it also uses magnetic reed switches. The display, like that of the QT-8D, is an 8-digit vacuum fluorescent display with nine individual tubes: eight digit tubes and a single extra tube for the minus sign and overflow indicator. As with the QT-8D, the tubes are Iseden \"itron\" tubes with the same distinctive \"handwritten\" digit style and the same half-height \"0\". However, unlike the QT-8D, the EL-8 digit tubes only have eight segments to form digits, and the EL-8's extra tube is positioned at the top right corner of the display instead of at its right end. A separate lamp serves as a power indicator. Power is supplied by an integrated rechargeable battery pack or by an external battery charger, which also serves as an AC adapter to allow the calculator to operate from AC power. The battery pack (model EL-84) contains six nickel-cadmium AA batteries connected in series, giving a total voltage of 7.2 volts and, with the original batteries, a total capacity of 450 milliampere-hours. (Present-day nickel-cadmium AA batteries have much greater capacity.) Battery life with the original batteries is about three hours, which gives an average power usage of about one watt. The battery charger (model EL-81) supplies power to the calculator's charging input at voltages of 8.7 and 9.6 volts; the combined input power rating is about 3.2 watts. The EL-8's battery pack is much smaller than that of the QT-8B, and this was critical in reducing the EL-8's size and weight. However, these smaller batteries have much less capacity, and in order to maintain reasonable battery life, power usage had to be drastically cut. This was done by various improvements in the electronics, especially in the display. The QT-8B's display tubes are driven by discrete transistors; to reduce the number of transistors needed, only one tube is lit at a time, and the circuitry cycles through the tubes in rapid sequence. The rapid switching from tube to tube requires load resistors which absorb a lot of power. In the EL-8, the display tubes are driven by integrated circuits containing multiple transistors, and all of the tubes are kept lit constantly. No switching is required and no load resistors are needed, so much less power is used. Furthermore, because each tube in the QT-8B is only lit for a fraction of the time, the tubes need a high momentary brightness in order to get a reasonable average brightness, so they must be driven with a high voltage, requiring a separate high-voltage power supply. Since the EL-8 tubes are kept constantly lit, they don't have to be as bright, so the driving voltage can be lower and a separate high-voltage supply is not needed. In addition to the display improvements, the EL-8 also has a more efficient clock generator circuit for its logic than the QT-8B. Together, these changes reduced the EL-8's power usage to less than a third of that of the QT-8B. Sharp also produced a version of the EL-8 without batteries called the EL-8A. This was offered at a lower price, about $300 in the U.S. in 1971, equivalent to $1,600 in 2010. Since this version lacks batteries, it is somewhat lighter and requires an AC adapter for power. The power connector is also slightly different, having an extra contact. In addition to its own EL-8 and EL-8A, Sharp also built OEM versions of the EL-8 for the Swedish office machine company Facit and its subsidiary Addo, which sold them as the Facit 1111 and the Addo-X 9364. These have the same internals as the EL-8, but the case and keycaps are different.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Stafford Gorman Whittle (December 5, 1849 – September 11, 1931) was born at the family home Woodstock in Mecklenburg County, Virginia.

It is manufactured, marketed, and distributed by Fabbrica d'Armi Pietro Beretta, in Gardone Val Trompia, Italy. The 682 comes in various grades for sporting clays, trap and skeet shooting. It is distributed in the UK by GMK Ltd, and in the United States by Beretta USA. Wide vs Narrow Beretta 682 Receivers There are two primary versions of the action of the Beretta 682 shotgun. The first version of the action is the original version, designated by a model number such as S682305T, and made at least through 1994. These earlier models are known as \"wide\" or \"large\" frame 682s. At some point, Beretta dropped the \"S\" from the front of the 682 model number, narrowed the receiver, introduced a new choke system, and reduced the barrel weight as well. This new model is consistent in width (or \"narrow\") with the 686 and 687 lines. It is important to know the version of the 682 in question, as the wood components from a current narrow 682/686/687 [1.525 inches, 38.7 mm] will not fit on an older S682 wide receiver [1.585 inches, 40.3 mm] shotgun; replacement stocks for wide 682 shotguns need to be custom made at this point. Other than serial number lookup for production year, measurement of the frame size is the width measured in front of the breech across the recoil shoulders. The older and newer models share many of the same parts, and barrel sets from narrow 682 shotguns can be used without issue in the wide S682 shotgun. However, there is only a 10% chance that a new model 682 barrel with drop in place and work properly on an older wide frame S682. Obviously, there will be a very small lip present where the narrow barrel doesn't exactly match the wide receiver. One of the most common issues with simply dropping an unfitted barrel into a S682 is that the ejectors may not work properly. The primary reason given for the design changes are general thought to be related to weight savings for competition shotguns. The shotgun was also made popular by the 2010 video game Call of Duty: Black Ops, although the gun is called the Olympia.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Codeine methylbromide (Eucodin) is the bromomethane (methylbromide) salt of codeine.

The routes were marked by a yellow rectangular shield with black numbers and border. Many shields were painted on telephone poles. The routes were approved by the highway departments of the six New England states in April 1922. Prior to the New England road marking system, through routes were mainly marked with colored bands on telephone poles. These were assigned by direction (red for east-west, blue for north-south and yellow for intermediate or diagonal routes). The Massachusetts Highway Commission convinced the rest of southern New England and New York to use this system in 1915 (New Hampshire and Vermont already had their own schemes, and Maine also opted out), and it was the main system until 1922. The New England road marking system, while limited to New England, was designed for expansion to the whole country. One- and two-digit numbers were assigned to major interstate routes, with three-digit routes for state routes (marked in a rectangle, with the state abbreviation below the number). In general, odd numbers ran east-west and even numbers ran north-south. The main exception was Route 1, which was to run along the Atlantic coast from Florida to Calais, Maine. A few of the major auto trails were not to be assigned numbers, instead being marked with letters—for instance, L for the Lincoln Highway and R for the Roosevelt International Highway. In 1926, several of the routes were supplanted by the national United States Numbered Highway System. Except for Route 1, which became U.S. Route 1, the old numbers were not used, since the U.S. Highway System uses odd numbers for north-south routes and even numbers for east-west routes. While some of the routes that did not become U.S. Routes were disbanded in the 1930s, many of these other routes still have their numbers today, although the unified signage is no longer used.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Kirin-Amgen, Inc.

Originally, \"jul\" was the name of a month in the old Germanic calendar. The concept of \"jul\" as a period of time rather than a specific event prevailed in Scandinavia; in modern times, \"Jul\" is a period of time stretching from mid-November to mid-January, with Christmas and the week up to New Year as its highlight. The modern English yule and yuletide derive from this term. The term \"Jul\" is common throughout Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Greenland, Denmark, Scotland and the Faroe Islands. Whereas the start of \"jul\" proper is announced by the chiming of church bells throughout the country in the afternoon of 24 December, it is more accurate to describe the season as an eight-week event. It consists of five phases: Advent, Julaften, Romjul, Nyttår, and The End of Christmas, very often with Epiphany, the thirteenth day of Christmas, as the final day of the season. From the original beginning on Christmas Day, the custom of Julebord has spread to the entire season and beyond, often beginning well in advance of December. The modern day celebration is largely based on the Church year and has retained several pre-Reformation and pre-Christian elements. The central event in Scandinavia is Christmas Eve (julaften), when the main Christmas meal is served and gifts are exchanged. This might be due to the old Germanic custom of counting time in nights, not days (e.g. \"forthnight\"), as it holds for other holidays like Midsummer Eve (Jonsok, lit. \"Wake of St. John\") and St. Olavs Mass (Olsok, lit. \"Wake of St. Olav\"), with the main celebration on the eve of the official Church day.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Possession is a 1981 French-German psychological horror-drama film co-written and directed by Andrzej Żuławski and starring Isabelle Adjani and Sam Neill.

It is the second entry in the Mystery Dungeon series, following 1993's Torneko no Daibōken. It was originally released for the Super Famicom in 1995 in Japan; a Nintendo DS remake was published by Sega in 2006 in Japan and 2008 in the West. The player takes the role of the rōnin Shiren, who travels through thirty areas on his way to the Land of the Golden Condor. The game is turn-based, with all enemies and characters in an area moving whenever the player performs an action, such as attacking or moving. If the player falls in battle, they lose all their progress and are forced to restart from the beginning of the game: to counter-act this, they can choose to store powerful items in warehouses, and pick them up again on further playthroughs; the Nintendo DS release also adds rescue quests, where a player can save other players who have fallen, allowing them to continue from where they left off. The game was developed with the core concept of repeated play, with the player having to improve their items through multiple playthroughs, and was seen as a way for the developers to more fully express the Mystery Dungeon series than with other titles in the series, which feature already existing game worlds that Chunsoft cannot change. The game was released to mixed reviews upon release, with reviewers criticizing the high difficulty and visuals, but praising how the game creates deep gameplay experiences through simple core gameplay concepts. Later, some publications called Shiren the Wanderer among the best in its genre and platform.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Dana W.

Symptoms may include feeling tired, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Occasionally spread may occur to the brain, skin, or gums. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated. Risk factors include smoking, previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy, myelodysplastic syndrome, and exposure to the chemical benzene. The underlying mechanism involves replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemia cells, which results in a drop in red blood cells, platelets, and normal white blood cells. Diagnosis is generally based on bone marrow aspiration and specific blood tests. AML has several subtypes; for which treatments and outcomes may vary. AML is typically initially treated with chemotherapy aimed at inducing remission. People may then go on to receive additional chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a stem cell transplant. The specific genetic mutations present within the cancer cells may guide therapy, as well as determine how long that person is likely to survive. Arsenic trioxide may be tried in cases that have recurred following usual treatments. AML affected about one million people globally in 2015 and resulted in 147,000 deaths. It most commonly occurs in older adults. Males are affected more often than females. AML is curable in about 35% of people under 60 years old and 10% over 60 years old. Older people who are not healthy enough to receive intensive chemotherapy have a typical survival of 5–10 months. It accounts for roughly 1.8% of cancer deaths in the United States.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"In legal terms, the right of substitution is a statutory right of all parties except the state. It is the right to change the presiding court official with or without cause.

It opens with \"Printcrime\", a piece of microfiction originally published in the January 2006 issue of Nature. The next story, \"When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth\" was originally published in ''Jim Baen's Universe'', an online magazine, and was also serially released on Doctorow's own podcast, as it was written. Doctorow says this process \"kept me honest and writing\". \"Anda's Game\", the third piece was selected by Michael Chabon for The Best American Short Stories 2005 after being published on Salon. Doctorow chose the name to sound like ''Ender's Game'', another science fiction story by Orson Scott Card.

The Basilists are an Old Calendarist group, who broke their association with many other Eastern Orthodox sects over their perceived acceptance of other religious groups. Mkalavishvili is primarily known for having led a series of violent vigilante raids on people and buildings of other religious groups in Tbilisi and other towns in Georgia. On October 17, 1999, Mkalavishvili led an attack on a meeting of 120 Jehovah's Witnesses at a meeting facility in the Tbilisi suburb of Gldani. Sixteen people required hospital treatment, including a mother of two who suffered permanent damage to one eye after being struck on the head. On March 24, 2001, a group of seven Assemblies of God pastors were meeting with three local missionaries to discuss the building of a Bible school to train local people for the pastorate, and were touring the property that had been set aside for that purpose, when they were set upon by a mob of approximately 100 individuals led by Mkalavishvili. This attack represented the first time Americans had been attacked. One pastor was badly beaten and required surgery to repair a broken hand. He also had led attacks against Baptists, Roman Catholics, and other Eastern Orthodox people whom Mkalavishvili viewed as not holding to the faith as he interpreted it.Mkalavishvili did not try to hide his attacks, which some believe numbered in the hundreds, but rather openly distributed videos of the attacks taking place. He depended upon witness intimidation and the reluctance of the government to prosecute a well-known religious figure for protection against prosecution. Someone once asked Mkalavishvili why he attacked people in their homes. He replied “That’s not true. We find out where they gather, and then we wait for them outside. When they come out, that’s when we attack them.” He also said that he was thankful to the Georgian police force for their support. In January 2004, Mikheil Saakashvili became President of the Republic of Georgia in the wake of the bloodless Rose Revolution coup, and brought about a more pro-western stance for the country, and Mkalavishvili lost his official protection. In this atmosphere, prosecutors were more willing to prefer charges; Vasili Mkalavishvili was arrested on March 12, 2004 and charged with three counts in regard to the attacks, which some have said were not nearly enough compared to the number of attacks he carried out by his own admission. On January 31, 2005, Mkalavishvili was sentenced to six years in prison for having carried out the raids. (Petre Ivanidze and Merab Korashinidze, who assisted Mkalavishvili, were given four years and one year in prison, respectively). He had previously been sentenced to a three-month pre-trial detention on June 4, 2003 by a court in Tbilisi. Mkalavishvili was released in prison in 2007 for health reasons, and kept a low profile, but in 2013 some Georgian Orthodox priests began rallying and sometimes physically attacking opponents over the issue of gay rights.

The vertices of these triangles are created from field recorded spot elevations through a variety of means including surveying through conventional, Global Positioning System Real-Time Kinematic (GPS RTK), photogrammetry, or some other means. Associated with three-dimensional data (x, y, and z) and topography, TINs are useful for the description and analysis of general horizontal (x and y) distributions and relationships. Digital TIN data structures are used in a variety of applications, including geographic information systems (GIS), and computer aided drafting (CAD) for the visual representation of a topographical surface. A TIN is an vector-based representation of the physical land surface or sea bottom, made up of irregularly distributed nodes and lines with three-dimensional coordinates (x, y, and z) that are arranged in a network of non-overlapping triangles. A TIN comprises a triangular network of vertices, known as mass points, with associated coordinates in three dimensions connected by edges to form a triangular tessellation. Three-dimensional visualizations are readily created by rendering of the triangular facets. In regions where there is little variation in surface height, the points may be widely spaced whereas in areas of more intense variation in height the point density is increased. A TIN used to represent terrain is often called a digital elevation model (DEM), which can be further used to produce digital surface models (DSM) or digital terrain models (DTM). An advantage of using a TIN over a rasterized digital elevation model (DEM) in mapping and analysis is that the points of a TIN are distributed variably based on an algorithm that determines which points are most necessary to create an accurate representation of the terrain. Data input is therefore flexible and fewer points need to be stored than in a raster DEM, with regularly distributed points. While a TIN may be considered less suited than a raster DEM for certain kinds of GIS applications, such as analysis of a surface's slope and aspect, it is often used in CAD to create contour lines. A DTM and DSM can be formed from a DEM. A DEM can be interpolated from a TIN. TIN are based on a Delaunay triangulation or constrained Delaunay. Delaunay conforming triangulations are recommended over constrained triangulations. This is because the resulting TINs are likely to contain fewer long, skinny triangles, which are undesirable for surface analysis. Additionally, natural neighbor interpolation and Thiessen (Voronoi) polygon generation can only be performed on Delaunay conforming triangulations. A constrained Delaunay triangulation can be considered when you need to explicitly define certain edges that are guaranteed not to be modified (that is, split into multiple edges) by the triangulator. Constrained Delaunay triangulations are also useful for minimizing the size of a TIN, since they have fewer nodes and triangles where breaklines are not densified. The TIN model was developed in the early 1970's as a simple way to build a surface from a set of irregularly spaced points. The first triangulated irregular network program for GIS was written by W. Randolph Franklin, under the direction of David Douglas and Thomas Peucker (Poiker), at Simon Fraser University in 1973.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Dragan Vasiljković (, born 12 December 1954), nicknamed Captain Dragan (), was a commander of a Serb paramilitary unit called the Knindže (or \"Knin ninjas\").

On the day of her debut, her wand broke; Big Bird told her to take her wand to the Fix-It Shop where Maria would fix it. Season 40 features her CGI-animated segment \"Abby's Flying Fairy School\". Her name is a pun of the magic word Abracadabra. Abby's magical powers are limited to popping in and out of thin air, floating when she's happy, and turning things into pumpkins. Although familiar with the world of fairy tales, Abby is astounded by such basic learning skills as drawing letters or counting, prompting her catchphrase \"That's so magical!\" She frequently uses her wand cell phone to call her mommy.

Abby's likeness has been adapted for a 43-foot balloon which premiered in the 2007 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, a full-body costume character for stage appearances and a number of merchandise items. In 2008, Abby was added to the cast of Plaza Sésamo, the Mexican co-production of Sesame Street, appearing in new segments where she tries to perform magic tricks with various ordinary objects.

The party was formed in March 1934 through a merger between the Icelandic Nationalist Movement (an anti-communist and anti-democratic ginger group) and the Icelandic Nationalist Party (a politicized splinter group of the former formed in 1933). The Nationalist Movement was loosely linked to the Independence Party and when the Nationalist Party was established many of its more conservative-minded adherents refused to join the new party. This initial departure of the more moderate tendency ensured that the Nationalist Party proved more radical and extremist than either of its predecessor groups. The party aimed to protect the ethnic identity of the Icelanders and believed in the supremacy of the Aryan race and anti-Semitism. They supported agricultural reform and were sympathetic to corporatism, whilst looking for the government to invest in industrialization. They also sought to abolish the Althing and replace it with a corporate parliament. The party also rejected the left-right dichotomy and presented themselves as a radical alternative for Icelandic politics. In all, they were more influenced by the ideas of Frits Clausen than those of Adolf Hitler and there is no evidence to suggest any direct link to Nazi Germany. Adopting some of the militaristic trappings of fascism, the party organised a number of marching squads which paraded on May 1 carrying both the Icelandic flag and the swastika. Members dressed in grey shirts and wore armbands decorated with a red swastika. The party produced a newspaper Ísland (Iceland) and a periodical Mjölnir (named after Thor's hammer), although they did not adopt the führerprinzip associated with Nazism as the movement had four different leaders in its brief life. The Nationalist Party failed to gain representation, except on the University of Iceland Student Council, where they held one seat for four years running. They did, however, gain attention in 1936 when they obtained a copy of the diary of the Minister of Finance and published details in Ísland. The party offices were raided by police and a number of leading members arrested, although ultimately there were no convictions. In general, however, they did not enjoy widespread support at any point in their existence, despite wide admiration for Nazi Germany in the island. This was reflected in their electoral performances, with the party gaining 0.7% of the vote in the 1934 election and 0.2% in 1937. Their best result was 2.8% in the 1934 municipal elections in Reykjavik. The party, which never had more than 450 members, began to decline after the arrests. 1938 was the last year in which the marching squads appeared, whilst the 1939 Aims of the Nationalist Party was their last major publication, apart from sporadic issues of Island. They organised a debating club in Reykjavík during the winter of 1939-1940 although it had no impact and the party generally only met in local cells from then on. Following the invasion of Iceland in 1940 the group was largely suppressed by the occupying Allies. The party was formally disbanded in 1944 when German defeat looked inevitable.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Markíza is a television station in Slovakia launched on 31 August 1996.

Paole's case, similar to that of Petar Blagojevich, became famous because of the direct involvement of the Austrian authorities and the documentation by Austrian physicians and officers, who confirmed the reality of vampires. Their report of the case was distributed in Western Europe and contributed to the spread of vampire belief among educated Europeans. The report and its significance for the subsequent eighteenth century vampire controversy are nowadays explained with the poor understanding of the process of corpse decomposition at the time. Knowledge of the case is based mostly on the reports of two Austrian military doctors, Glaser and Flückinger, who were successively sent to investigate the case.

The target prior to the season was promotion to Serie A, and several experienced players were brought in to achieve that goal, among them Massimo Carrera, Renato Olive, Rubens Pasino and Gianluca Savoldi. Especially the signing of Savoldi was significant, since he is the son of legendary Napoli striker Giuseppe Savoldi. Even though the club lost captain Roberto Stellone to Reggina, its chances to be promoted were seen as rather good. When the season unfolded, Napoli drew way to many matches, and could not manage to score enough goals. Then supporter Sergio Ercolano was killed when falling down from the stands at the derby with Avellino. That forced Napoli to play three home matches in front of an empty stadium.

Other common ingredients may include mayonnaise, hard-boiled egg, celery, onion, pepper, pickles (or pickle relish) and a variety of mustards. In the United States, \"chicken salad\" refers to either any salad with chicken, or a specific mixed salad consisting primarily of chopped chicken meat and a binder, such as mayonnaise or salad dressing. Like tuna salad and egg salad, it may be served on top of lettuce, tomato, avocado, or some combination of these. It may also be used for sandwiches. Typically it is made with leftover or canned chicken. It may also refer to a garden salad with fried, grilled, or roasted chicken (usually cut up or diced) on top. In Europe and Asia the salad may be complemented by any number of dressings, or no dressing at all, and the salad constituents can vary from traditional leaves and vegetables, to pastas, couscous, noodles or rice. Early American chicken salad recipes can be found in 19th-century Southern cookbooks, including Sarah Rutledge's \"The Carolina Housewife: Or, House and Home\" (1847) and Abby Fisher's \"What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking\" (1881). Rutledge details a recipe for \"A Salad To Be Eaten With Cold Meat Or Fowl\" that explains how to make a mayonnaise from scratch, before adding it to cold meats (chicken and seafood). Abby Fisher similarly describes making a homemade mayonnaise, before adding it to chicken and white celery. One of the first American forms of chicken salad was served by Town Meats in Wakefield, Rhode Island, in 1863. The original owner, Liam Gray, mixed his leftover chicken with mayonnaise, tarragon, and grapes. This became such a popular item that the meat market was converted to a delicatessen.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Seamus Liam Davey-Fitzpatrick (born December 29, 1998) is an American teen actor.

Just Another Town is a portrait of the city Duhan grew up in. It sings of the people and location that formed him. Its melody and poetry come from the homes, bars, dancehalls, chapels, gardens, prisons, factories, and the very streets of the town it celebrates. It is not a nostalgic look back in blinkered pleasure. The landscape is urban, gritty and hard, and the characters are flawed and damaged. DH Lawrence once described towns as “scabs” on the face of the earth before he attempted to flee back to some primitive idyll. Modern cities are indeed scabs on the face of the world, but the way Johnny sees it, scabs are healing skin formations in the process of transforming damaged tissue back into healthy flesh. One of the greatest achievements of mankind, Duhan believes, is that we have learned to live in relative harmonious community in vast cities all over the world in a relatively short space of time. A spiritual dimension lies behind the ordering process that has brought about this transformation. Just Another Town attempts to illustrate some of the elements and forces that bound together the fragile community Duhan grew up with. It also shows how youthful innocence can act as a compass to guide us in doubting times.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Most Reverend Dr Adam Urias de Pencier  (1866-1949) was the third Bishop of New Westminster and second Archbishop and Metropolitan of British Columbia.

She was born in Kusatsu, Gunma, Japan. She later moved to Kagoshima which is her parents' hometown. Nakayama became a member of the Japan Professional Bowling Association in 1969, representing Tokyo Tower Bowling Center. During her professional bowling career, Nakayama accumulated 33 wins. She attained the number-one rank among JPBA female bowlers in 1969 (avg. 197.6) and 1970 (avg. 199.2), and was ranked among the top-three from 1969 to 1973. On August 21, 1970, Nakayama rolled a perfect 300 game on Japanese national television, becoming the first woman ever to perform the feat in any television market. (It took nearly 27 years before Michelle Feldman rolled the first American television 300-game in 1997.) She rolled the game during a tournament match, aired on the bowling show Ladies Challenge Bowl (October 1969 to March 1975,) at Fuchū Star Lanes. By the end of 1970, she earned the Japan Professional Sports Award for outstanding achievement. Because of her 300-game, Nakayama became very famous in Japan, and would eventually boost the sport of bowling. In 1970, she appeared in a shampoo commercial, and also had a song written about her, titled Sawayaka Ritsuko-san (さわやか律子さん). She was a guest judge for the 21st NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen (1970), as well as a guest presenter for the 13th Japan Record Awards (1971). In 1971, TBS aired the Japanese television drama Beautiful Challenger, the storyline covering an office lady who joins the company bowling club and competes with other clubs. Both Nakayama, as well as Rie Ishii appeared in the drama series as themselves. Nakayama also held a female world's record for a three-game series of 824 (268, 257 and 299), setting the record on July 15, 1971. Nakayama's arch rival was Kayoko Suda (須田開代子). In 1990, Nakayama was forced to retire from bowling full-time, due to injury to her right shoulder and left knee (her sliding leg). Still, in 1994, she was able to place 4th in The Prince Cup. 1994 was also the year Nakayama celebrated her 25th anniversary as a professional. Today, Nakayama no longer competes in JPBA tournaments. She is, however, very involved in the operations side of bowling in Japan. Nakayama was president of the JPBA until 2012. She is a co-founder and current president of the Japan Ladies Bowling Club (JLBC) - an organization she and Suda created. She is also vice-president of the Bowling Council of Japan (BCJ.)

Centered on the development of the 1964 film Mary Poppins, the film stars Emma Thompson as author P. L. Travers and Tom Hanks as filmmaker Walt Disney, with supporting performances by Paul Giamatti, Jason Schwartzman, Bradley Whitford, and Colin Farrell. Deriving its title from the father in Travers' story, Saving Mr. Banks depicts the author's fortnight-long meetings during 1961 in Los Angeles, during which Disney attempts to obtain the screen rights to her novels. Essential Media Entertainment and BBC Films initially developed Saving Mr. Banks as an independent production until 2011, when producer Alison Owen approached Walt Disney Pictures for permission to use copyrighted elements. The film's subject matter piqued Disney's interest, leading the studio to acquire the screenplay and produce the film. Principal photography commenced the following year in September before wrapping in November 2012; the film was shot almost entirely in the Southern California area, primarily at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, where a majority of the film's narrative takes place. Saving Mr. Banks premiered at the London Film Festival on October 20, 2013, and was released theatrically that same year in the United Kingdom on November 29 and in the United States on December 13. Upon release, the film received positive reviews, with praise directed towards the acting, screenplay, and musical score. Thompson's performance garnered a BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role|Screen Actors Guild Award]], and Critic's Choice Award nominations for Best Actress, while composer Thomas Newman earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score.

It deals with incest and was added to the German List of Media Harmful to Young People in 1987 and is still in the index. The song follows an incident between a boy and his 14-year-old sister, where they are left alone by the parents and then engage in intercourse; it is also implied that this will be repeated from another position. Farin Urlaub, who wrote this song, thanks his younger half-sister ironically in the booklet of the album, \"for her super sibling love\". According to Urlaub, he wrote the song at age 15, in 1979. The song however, was not released until 1986, on the self-titled album Die Ärzte. The song had been a part of their concert setlists for a long time and since \"Claudia hat 'nen Schäferhund\", a song about zoophilia, released on Debil, made it without being put on the index, it was decided that \"Geschwisterliebe\" would be released. The album was, however, indexed due to a complaint from a mother on 27 January 1987, because of this song - it was decided that this song encouraged sex between siblings. This also led to Debil's being indexed due to the songs \"Claudia hat 'nen Schäferhund\" (Claudia has a German shepherd) and \"Schlaflied\" (Lullaby, about a monster eating you gruesomely after you fall asleep). Indexing the two albums, Die Ärzte and Debil, was a strong setback for Die Ärzte, because the indexed albums were not to be sold to minors and one retailer took the whole of the band's works from its shelves. Die Ärzte could not play the song live anymore, and one concert was limited to persons over 18 only. In 2004 the indexing of the songs was reviewed and Debil was removed from the index (which was celebrated with a re-release of the album), but \"Geschwisterliebe\" stayed on the index.
