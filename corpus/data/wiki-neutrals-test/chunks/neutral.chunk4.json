He works in subjects including continental philosophy, political theory, cultural studies, psychoanalysis, film criticism, Marxism, Hegelianism and theology. In 1989, Žižek published his first English text, The Sublime Object of Ideology, in which he departed from traditional Marxist theory to develop a materialist conception of ideology that drew heavily on Lacanian psychoanalysis and Hegelian idealism. His early theoretical work became increasingly eclectic and political in the 1990s, dealing frequently in the critical analysis of disparate forms of popular culture and making him a popular figure of the academic left. A critic of capitalism, neoliberalism and political correctness, Žižek calls himself a political radical, and his work has been characterized as challenging orthodoxies of both the political right and the social-liberal universities. Žižek's idiosyncratic style, popular academic works, frequent magazine op-eds, and critical assimilation of high and low culture have gained him international influence, controversy, criticism and a substantial audience outside academe. In 2012, Foreign Policy listed Žižek on its list of Top 100 Global Thinkers, calling him \"a celebrity philosopher\" while elsewhere he has been dubbed the \"Elvis of cultural theory\" and \"the most dangerous philosopher in the West\".

The design of the church was inspired by Garnisons Church in Copenhagen. Virtually all fixtures in the church are of wood, but pillars and surfaces have been marbled. The whole church has a cool blue color as a result. On either side of the altar and pulpit are the pillars that bear the organ gallery above. The Baroque organ is from 1765 and made by organ builder Gottfried Heinrich Gloger. In the 1850s it was restored by Paul Brantzeg and in 1932 by Josef Hilmar Jørgensen. In 1928, Tinius Olsen gave a major donation to the restoration of the organ which was water damage in the late 1880s. The baptismal font was carved out of marble extracted from Holmestrand in Vestfold. The chandeliers were produced at Nøstetangen glassverk in Hokksund during the second half of the 1700s.

She was the largest steel-hulled shipwreck in Lake Ontario. The Milwaukee Sentinel reported that the Dalwarnic was owned by the Canadian National Railway. The Dalwarnic was requisitioned into Government service in 1940, and carried supplies to Newfoundland outports. Sources differ as to what happened to the Dalwarnic after World War II.

He had three associate justices to work with him, though in later centuries the number of associate justices  was reduced to two. He was also required to act as an itinerant justice when necessary. In addition to his judicial office he served as  Deputy Treasurer of Ireland. The Crown continued to hold him in high regard: in 1281 he received financial rewards for his loyalty, and in 1284 in consideration of his long service he was excused from going on assize. He retired on health grounds in 1298; his date of death is uncertain. His eldest son and heir, also named Robert, was like his father a judge.

It was severely damaged during the English Civil War, allowed  subsequently to fall into ruin, and  was demolished in the early nineteenth century.

The commission was completed entirely in Urbino and efforts were made to supply Barocci with extensive information about the contextual chapel, which was frescoed by Cherubino Alberti with a Triumph of the Holy Cross. Gian Pietro Bellori wrote that the pope was supplied with preparatory sketches. The pope sought the removal of Satan from the original design, and thereafter asked that it depict a night scene. Barocci quotes from Raphael's School of Athens by inserting the portrait of Heraclitus, which many believe is a portrait of Michelangelo. Significantly, he depicts Judas Iscariot using Michelangelo's portrait. To an audience familiar with this association, this would have been taken as particularly strong commentary on the status of the Michelangelo. Furthermore, by directly quoting from Raphael, who was Michelangelo's antithesis and favoured by the Clementine church, Barocci, and by implication Pope Clement VIII, inserted a comment on the relative status of the two artists within the church of the time. Barocci asked 1,500 scudi for the altarpiece. The fee undoubtedly was influenced by the number of figures. At the same point in his career (1604), he had accepted 300 scudi for a much simpler Crucifixion (Museo del Prado, Madrid).","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Hot 20 is a greatest hits album by Brazilian new wave band João Penca e Seus Miquinhos Amestrados, and the band's seventh and last release overall.

Founded by Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin in 1984 as an independent developer, the studio was acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment in 2001. Gavin and Rubin produced a sequence of progressively more successful games, including Rings of Power and Way of the Warrior in the early 1990s. The latter—a very low-budget but still plausible offering—prompted Universal Interactive Studios to sign the duo to a three-title contract and fund the expansion of the company. Longtime American game designer and producer Mark Cerny convinced Naughty Dog to focus its new resources on creating a character-based platform game that would fully exploit the 3D capabilities of the new systems. Ultimately, this led to the release of Crash Bandicoot for the PlayStation in 1996. Naughty Dog developed three Crash Bandicoot games over the next several years. After developing Crash Team Racing, the company began working on Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy for the PlayStation 2. In 2004, Rubin, who had become the company's president, left the company to work on a new project named Iron and the Maiden. In addition to their inhouse game team, Naughty Dog is also home to the ICE Team, one of SIE Worldwide Studios's central technology groups.

The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from \"cool\" to \"warm\", \"hot\", and \"critical\" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to \"cool\" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme. The standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well. The standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer-controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender's turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time. Cyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first.

In American football, the two events that are officially classified as \"turnovers\" are fumbles (accidental physical loss of a live ball a player has possession of) or interceptions (passes intended for a member of the passing team, but caught by a member of the opposing team). In addition, the term \"turnover\" is often used to refer to a turnover on downs, when a team attempts to gain a first down, touchdown or field goal on a fourth down play (known as a fourth down conversion), but is unsuccessful. When this occurs, the opposing team automatically gains possession at the spot to which the ball was advanced at the end of the play, unless a penalty has occurred (every defensive penalty, if accepted, results either in an automatic first down or a replay of down). In this event, the team that has lost possession is not permitted an opportunity to advance the ball any further. National Football League game statistics recording turnovers only include lost fumbles and intercepted passes; turnovers on downs are not included (e.g., a team whose only turnovers are turnovers on downs is credited with having \"no turnovers\"). In Canadian football, turnovers generally occur in a similar manner to American football, except that a turnover on downs will occur after three downs instead of four. In addition, Canadian Football League statistics record turnovers on downs on an equal basis to turnovers caused by fumbles and interceptions.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Primera División de México (Mexican First Division) Verano 1998 is a Mexican football tournament - one of two short tournaments that take up the entire year to determine the champion(s) of Mexican football.

In the first episode, hundreds of remaining applicants were whittled down to just twelve finalists, by a panel of judges composed of fashion stylist Gok Wan, musician Myleene Klass, magazine editor James Brown, journalist Kathryn Flett and musician, actress and TV presenter Mica Paris. In subsequent episodes, various issues were explored such as body image, plastic surgery, self-esteem, modern versus Renaissance and earlier notions of beauty, eating disorders, over-reliance on makeup, the fashion industry.

The current facility was constructed between 1974 and 1979 in response to the continued degeneration of the original facility located in downtown Deer Lodge. The \"Old Prison\" () served as the Montana Territorial Prison from its creation in 1871 until Montana achieved statehood in 1889, then continued as the primary penal institution for the State of Montana until 1979. Throughout the prison's history, the institution was plagued with constant overcrowding, insufficient funds, and antiquated facilities. The administration of Warden Frank Conley from 1890 to 1921 proved the exception to this rule, as Warden Conley instituted extensive inmate labor projects that kept many inmates at work constructing the prison buildings and walls as well as providing various state and community services like road building, logging, and ranching. After Conley left office, the prison experienced almost forty years of degeneration, mismanagement, and monetary restraints until an explosive riot in 1959 captured the attention of the nation. Led by Jerry Myles and Lee Smart, the riot maintained the prison under inmate control for thirty-six hours before the Montana National Guard stormed the institution to restore order. The facility was retired in September 1979, and the inmates were moved to the current prison.

He is also the studio host for BYUtv's True Blue, co-host for the Countdown to Kickoff Pregame Show and the Postgame Show, and is the lead play-by-play announcer for BYUtv's college football and men's basketball. McCann occasionally calls women's college basketball with Kristen Kozlowski and college baseball games with Gary Sheide for BYUtv. McCann is the third of 10 children in his family and is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He served a two-year mission for the church in San Antonio, Texas. Upon his return he enrolled at Brigham Young University (BYU) where he earned a degree in broadcasting. He graduated from BYU in 1991 and was hired by ABC's Good Morning America to be their first sports reporter. After a few years at ABC, McCann was hired by KLAS in Las Vegas, Nevada where he was the sports anchor for 13 years. While in Las Vegas, McCann was also granted additional duties, as the voice of UNLV's football radio play-by-play for 14 seasons (1995–2009). McCann also called men's basketball TV home games for the Rebels on KUPN and MWC broadcasts for Friday Night Football and the women's basketball tournament games for SportsWest Productions. As KLAS rotated through anchors, McCann continued to remain a strong hold for the station. After 13 seasons as the sports anchor, McCann was offered the chance to be a co-anchor for \"8 News Now This Morning.\" McCann co-hosted the show with Dayna Roselli until June 2012. In 2007, BYUtv contacted McCann about being a broadcaster for upcoming BYU men's basketball games in the Las Vegas Invitational. McCann called 3 games during the tournament. In 2009, BYUtv again contacted McCann about doing college basketball games for the network during the upcoming Las Vegas Classic. McCann again accepted, but this time was hired to be the lead play-by-play man for all BYUtv men's basketball games. His contract with the network began December 5, 2009. For most men's college basketball broadcasts in 2009 and 2010 BYUtv used a tandem of McCann doing play-by-play, Andy Toolson as the analyst, and Jarom Jordan as the sideline reporter, though Dave Bollwinkel was the analyst with McCann for the 2009 Las Vegas Classic championship game. In 2011, Toolson left the BYUtv Sports team. BYUtv hired Blaine Fowler and Steve Cleveland to take over the role of analyst for the 2011-12 season's broadcasts. Robbie Bullough replaced Jarom Jordan as the sideline reporter for most home games, but BYUtv didn't use a sideline reporter for every broadcast. In the fall of 2010, BYUtv began looking for a new studio host for the True Blue sports magazine program. McCann was eventually hired to be the host. He began running the show on August 25, 2010, replacing long time producer Toni Cook after she graduated from BYU. Despite becoming the leading sports man for BYUtv, McCann continued to operate on KLAS. McCann would fly into Salt Lake City and then drive from Salt Lake to Provo for BYUtv games and to record shows, but when he wasn't recording or broadcasting events for BYUtv he continued to be the co-host for \"8 News Now This Morning.\" In 2011, BYU's football team became an independent FBS team. BYUtv created a full-hour pre-game show and a half-hour post-game show to help get fans ready for the games. McCann was hired as one of the hosts, along with Alema Harrington. Kathy Aiken provided reports on the players. Sheide, Fowler, and David Nixon provided analysis and keys to the game. Bullough and Greg Wrubell provided reports from the stadium. For home games, BYUtv was authorized to produce their own broadcast. McCann was the play-by-play man, with Fowler or Sheide providing the analysis. On March 12, 2012, it was announced that McCann would leave KLAS. McCann moved from Las Vegas to the Salt Lake area to work for KSL-TV. McCann and Mike Headrick replaced the retiring Bruce Lindsay as co-anchors with Nadine Wimmer on KSL's evening newscasts. The job at KSL began in June 2012. McCann continues doing football, basketball, and True Blue for BYUtv in addition to taking on the new responsibilities. McCann also takes turns with Wimmer and Headrick in solo anchoring \"Deseret News Sunday Edition\". The program's predecessor, \"Sunday Edition\" was previously anchored by Lindsay (until his retirement) and then by Richard Piatt before McCann, Wimmer and Headrick took on the assignment.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Act, 1998 (AARTO, Act No. 46 of 1998) is an act of the Parliament of South Africa which introduces a points demerit system for violations of traffic law. It is managed by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), a public entity under the Department of Transport. Although the act was enacted in 1998, it has not yet been fully implemented, but has now been rescheduled for a national rollout to the whole country early in 2012. South Africa has one of the highest road accident and fatality statistics in the world and the intention of AARTO is to address the situation by encouraging responsible driving habits amongst the motoring public. AARTO introduces a Demerit Points System, for the first time in South Africa, which is intended to penalize drivers and fleet operators who are habitual offenders. Under AARTO, traffic infringements will result in points being allocated to a driver's licence. On reaching 12 points the licence is suspended. If no infringements occur within a three-month period a point will be deducted. If a license is suspended three times it is permanently revoked. The Act has serious implications for the entire South African Transport Industry. ALL role players, from senior management to the lowest level driver employee are affected. Driver based employees stand to lose their livelihood if their licence is suspended. Management and fleet operators may face crippling blows to their business as entire fleets can be grounded. In spite of its pending implementation on a national basis, there is a great deal of uncertainty about the AARTO Act and numerous amendments have made it difficult for the public and business sector to adequately prepare. Education on AARTO is imperative for all role players to be adequately trained on AARTO prior to its implementation. Failure to prepare for and comply with the provisions of this act could be disastrous for individuals and businesses.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The discontinuity effect is known as the markedly greater competitiveness displayed between different, interacting groups relative to the competitiveness displayed when individuals interact with other individuals. Given that group competition over scarce resources is believed to lead to group-level conflict (see realistic group conflict theory), it has been asserted that the link between competition and conflict is also considerably more powerful between groups than between individuals. While individuals within a group may prefer to be cooperative, once they join together to make a collective unit, individual orientations favoring cooperation tend to be overshadowed by competitive orientations of the group. The discontinuity between individuals and groups has been consistently replicated in laboratory settings, but are not confined to them. These effects emerge during sports activities, sessions of classes, and even when groups merge to plan or strategize (Forsyth, 2010).","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Moscow Summit was a summit meeting between U.S. Pres. Ronald Reagan and General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev. It was held on May 29, 1988 – June 3, 1988. Reagan and Gorbachev finalized the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) after the U.S. Senate's ratification of the treaty in May 1988. Reagan and Gorbachev continued to discuss bilateral issues like Central America, Southern Africa, the Middle East and the pending withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Reagan and Gorbachev continued their discussions on human rights. The parties signed seven agreements on lesser issues such as student exchanges and fishing rights. A significant result was the updating of Soviet history books, which necessitated cancelling some history classes in Soviet secondary schools. In the end, Reagan expressed satisfaction with the summit. Reagan and Gorbachev eventually issued a joint statement, of which excerpts are shown here: ''The President and the General Secretary view the Moscow summit as an important step in the process of putting U.S.-Soviet relations on a more productive and sustainable basis. Their comprehensive and detailed discussions covered the full agenda of issues to which the two leaders agreed during their initial meeting in Geneva in November 1985 -an agenda encompassing arms control, human rights and humanitarian matters, settlement of regional conflicts and bilateral relations. Serious differences remain on important issues; the frank dialogue which has developed between the two countries remains critical to surmounting these differences.'' ''. . . The President and the General Secretary underscored the historic importance of their meetings in Geneva, Reykjavik, Washington and Moscow in laying the foundation for a realistic approach to the problems of strengthening stability and reducing the risk of conflict. They reaffirmed their solemn conviction that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought, their determination to prevent any war between the United States and Soviet Union, whether nuclear or conventional, and their disavowal of any intention to achieve military superiority.'' ''The two leaders are convinced that the expanding political dialogue they have established represents an increasingly effective means of resolving issues of mutual interest and concern. They do not minimize the real differences of history, tradition and ideology which will continue to characterize the U.S.-Soviet relationship. But they believe that the dialogue will endure, because it is based on realism and focused on the achievement of concrete results. . . . It is a process which the President and the General Secretary believe serves the best interests of the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union, and can contribute to a more stable, more peaceful and safer world.'' Arms Control ''The President and the General Secretary, having expressed the commitment of their two countries to build on progress to date in arms control, determined objectives and next steps on a wide range of issues in this area. These will guide the efforts of the two Governments in the months ahead as they work with each other and with other states toward equitable, verifiable agreements that strengthen international stability and security.'' Nuclear and Space Talks ''The two leaders noted that a joint draft text of a treaty on reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms has been elaborated. . . . While important additional work is required before this treaty is ready for signature, many key provisions are recorded in the joint draft text and are considered to be agreed, subject to the completion and ratification of the treaty.'' ''Taking into account a treaty on strategic offensive arms, the sides have continued negotiations to achieve a separate agreement concerning the ABM treaty building on the language of the Washington summit joint statement dated Dec. 10, 1987. Progress was noted in preparing the joint draft text of an associated protocol.'' ''The joint draft treaty on reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms reflects the earlier understanding on establishing ceilings of no more than 1,600 strategic offensive delivery systems and 6,000 warheads as well as agreement on subceilings of 4,900 on the aggregate of ICBM and SLBM warheads and 1,540 warheads on 154 heavy missiles.'' ''The draft treaty also records the sides' agreement that as a result of the reductions the aggregate throw weight of the Soviet Union's ICBMs and SLBMs will be reduced to a level approximately 50 percent below the existing level and this level will not be exceeded.'' ''During the negotiations the two sides have also achieved understanding that in future work on the treaty they will act on the understanding that on deployed ICBMs and SLBMs of existing types the counting rule will include the number of warheads referred to in the joint statement of Dec. 10, 1987, and the number of warheads which will be attributed to each new type of ballistic missile will be subject to negotiation.'' ''In addition, the sides agreed on a counting rule for heavy bomber armaments according to which heavy bombers equipped only for nuclear gravity bombs and SRAMs will count as one delivery vehicle against the 1,600 limit and one warhead against the 6,000 limit.'' ''The delegations have also prepared joint draft texts of an inspection protocol, a conversion or elimination protocol, and a memorandum of understanding on data, which are integral parts of the treaty. These documents build on the verification provisions of the INF treaty, extending and elaborating them as necessary to meet the more demanding requirements of Start. The Start verification measures will, at a minimum, include:'' ''A. Data exchanges, to include declarations and appropriate notifications on the number and location of weapons systems limited by Start, including locations and facilities for production, final assembly, storage, testing, repair, training, deployment, conversion and elimination of such systems. Such declarations will be exchanged between the sides before the treaty is signed and updated periodically.'' B. Baseline inspections to verify the accuracy of these declarations. C. On-site observation of elimination of strategic systems necessary to meet the agreed limits. D. Continuous on-site monitoring of the perimeter and portals of critical production facilities to confirm the output of weapons to be limited. E. Short-notice on-site inspection of: ''I. Declared locations during the process of reducing to agreed limits; II. Locations where systems covered by this treaty remain after achieving the agreed limits; and III. Locations where such systems have been located (formerly declared facilities).'' ''F. Short-notice inspection, in accordance with agreed-upon procedures, of locations where either side considers covert deployment, production, storage or repair of strategic offensive arms could be occurring.'' ''G. Prohibition of the use of concealment or other activities which impede verification by national technical means. Such provisions would include a ban on telemetry encryption and would allow for full access to all telemetric information broadcast during missile flight.'' H. Procedures that enable verification of the number of warheads on deployed ballistic missiles of each specific type, including on-site inspection. ''I. Enhanced observation of activities related to reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms by national technical means. These would include open displays of treaty-limited items at missile bases, bomber bases and submarine ports at locations and times chosen by the inspecting party.'' The two sides have also begun to exchange data on their strategic forces. ''During the course of this meeting in Moscow, the exchanges on Start resulted in the achievement of substantial additional common ground, particularly in the areas of ALCMs and the attempts to develop and agree, if possible, on a solution to the problem of verification of mobile ICBMs.'' The sides also discussed the question of limiting long-range, nuclear-armed SLCMs. ''Ronald Reagan and M. S. Gorbachev expressed their joint confidence that the extensive work done provides the basis for concluding the treaty on reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms which will promote strategic stability and strengthen security not only of the peoples of the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A., but of all mankind.'' ''Guided by this fundamental agreement . . . the delegations of the two countries have been instructed to return to Geneva on July 12, 1988. It has been agreed as a matter of principle that, once the remaining problems are solved and the treaty and its associated documents are agreed, they will be signed without delay.'' Nuclear Testing ''The leaders reaffirmed the commitment of the two sides to conduct in a single forum full-scale, stage-by-stage negotiations on the issues relating to nuclear testing. In these negotiations the sides as the first step will agree upon effective verification measures which will make it possible to ratify the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974 and Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty of 1976, and proceed to negotiating further intermediate limitations on nuclear testing leading to the ultimate objective of the complete cessation of nuclear testing as part of the effective disarmament process. This process, among other things, would pursue, as the first priority, the goal of the reduction of nuclear weapons and ultimately, their elimination. In implementing the first objective of these negotiations, agreement upon effective verification measures for the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974, the sides agreed to design and conduct a joint verification experiment at each other's test sites.'' ''The leaders . . . also noted the substantial progress on a new protocol to the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty and urged continuing constructive negotiations on effective verification measures for the Threshold Test Ban Treaty.'' ''Expressing their conviction that the progress achieved so far forms a solid basis for continuing progress on issues relating to nuclear testing, the leaders instructed the negotiators to complete expeditiously the preparation of a protocol to the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty and to complete the preparation of a protocol to the Threshold Test Ban Treaty as soon as possible after the joint verification experiment has been conducted and analyzed. They confirmed their understanding that verification measures for the TTBT will, to the extent appropriate, be used in further nuclear test limitation agreements which may subsequently be reached. They also declared their mutual intention to seek ratification of both the 1974 and 1976 treaties when the corresponding protocols to the Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty are completed, and to continue negotiations as agreed in the Washington joint summit statement.'' One ironic instance of the summit was when Reagan gave Gorbachev a copy of the movie Friendly Persuasion, whose screenwriter Michael Wilson got blacklisted in the 1950s due to suspected communist sympathies.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Eastern Iran includes the provinces North Khorasan, Razavi Khorasan, South Khorasan and Sistan and Baluchestan some of which share a border with Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The evangelical academy movement arose after the Second World War in response to the moral collapse of German society. Helmut Thielicke and Eberhard Müller worked out the practical framework in 1945. Loosely modeled on Plato’s academy, the academies emphasized dialogue over didacticism. The first academy in Germany was founded in Bad Boll in 1945. The movement spread quickly throughout Germany, although academies in East Germany experienced political discrimination. The academies supported nascent West German democracy by providing open, ideologically-neutral forums for conversations between opposing interest groups. The Christian dimension of the academies was made unobtrusive to encourage participation by alienated Christians. Since leaders found it difficult to offer quality conferences on every topic of contemporary societal interest, many specialized in the arts, sciences, or politics. While most academies developed official ties with the ecclesiastical structures in their states, relations between local churches and academies frequently remained distant. During the 1960s Some argued that the academies should not remain neutral with regard to social questions but should take the side of the oppressed. Others held that this proposed change violated the movement’s open spirit. Evangelical academies continue to flourish in contemporary Germany.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"A participation trophy is a trophy given to children who participate in a sporting event but do not finish in first, second or third place, and so would not normally be eligible for a trophy.

His correspondence with the tsar is a unique source for the history of 16th-century Russia. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 16th century Prince Andrew Kurbsky dynasty Rurikovich was written in Polish in documents under the surname Krupski Coat of arms Levart (Lew II). Kurbsky belonged to a family of Rurikid princes, which got its name from the town of Kurba near Yaroslavl. At an early age, he gained renown for the courage displayed in the annual campaigns against Kazan. During the decisive siege of Kazan he commanded the right flank of the Russian army and was wounded. Two years later, he defeated the Udmurt rebels and became a boyar. At that time, Kurbsky became one of the closest associates and advisors to the Tsar. During the Livonian War, Kurbsky led the Russian troops against the fortress of Dorpat (today Tartu, Estonia), and was victorious. After Ivan failed to renew his commission, Kurbsky defected to Lithuania on April 30, 1564, citing impending repressions as his reason. Later the same year he led a Polish-Lithuanian army against Russia and devastated the region of Velikie Luki. As a reward, Sigismund II August, king of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, gave him the town of Kovel in Volhynia (Ukraine), where he lived peacefully, defending his Orthodox subjects from Polish encroachments. Kurbsky thus became the first Russian political emigre. Kurbsky is best remembered for a series of vitriolic letters he exchanged with the Tsar between 1564 and 1579. In 1573, he wrote a political pamphlet, which voiced the former independent princeling's disapproval of Ivan's slide towards absolutism. In his writings, Kurbsky blames the tsar for a number of pathologically cruel crimes, but historians still disagree as to whether his claims should be given credit. Kurbsky's language is remarkable for abundance of foreign loans, especially from Latin, which he had mastered in emigration. Prince Kurbsky often supported the opposition to the regime. Grandson of Semyon Ivanovich Kurbsky was married to the daughter of a disgraced Prince Andrew of the Uglich. Kurbsky support in the struggle for the throne, not Vasily III, and grandson, Dmitri, even more than earned the dislike of Moscow's rulers. Dmitri's son Prince Kurbsky (Krupski) from Orthodoxy converted to Catholicism. And he left progeny in Belarus. A dramatized account of his life, in which he is depicted as the second most powerful aristocrat in Russia, only after the Tsar, who is constantly put under pressure by boyars that want to make him revolt against the imperial authority at Moscow, can be found in the epic work of Soviet film director Sergei Eisenstein, Ivan the Terrible.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Desmond \"Des\" MacHale (born 28 January 1946) is Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at University College Cork, Ireland.

The islands are within a few miles of Venezuela, and the species are therefore typical of tropical South America. However, the number of species is relatively low compared to the mainland, as would be expected on small islands. The resident breeding birds are augmented in the northern winter by migrants from North America, although the variety of migrant passerines is very limited compared to Central America. Except as an entry is cited otherwise, the list of species and the status of each are as determined by the Trinidad & Tobago Bird Status & Distribution Committee (TTBSCD) as of August 2016.

In a classification of orchids that was published in 2015, Diseae was not recognized, but was instead placed in synonymy under Orchideae. In 2007, a molecular phylogenetic study showed that the large genus Disa (~182 species) is paraphyletic over the small genus Schizodium. Accordingly, in the 2015 classification, the genus Schizodium was sunk into Disa. Also, the subtribe Huttonaeinae was sunk into Disinae, and the subtribe Satyriinae was sunk into Orchidinae. The expanded tribe Orchideae consisted of the subtribes Brownleeinae, Disinae, Coryciinae, and Orchidinae. Disperis was transferred from Coryciinae to Brownleeinae and Pachites was transferred from Satyriinae to Disinae. The placement of Pachites and Huttonaea in Disinae was done with considerable doubt. Four genera were recognized in the subtribe Coryciinae (Evotella, Ceratandra, Corycium and Pterygodium), even tho it was known that Corycium and Pterygodium are polyphyletic, with all but one species of Corycium composing a clade that is deeply embedded within Pterygodium.

All Préfontaines in North America are descended from Antoine Fournier \"dit Préfontaine\" (born in 1663 in Picardie, France; died in 1702 in Montréal, Canada). He was a French soldier and a barrel cooper by trade in the Compagnie de Troyes, French Marines in Canada. At the time it was common for French soldiers to adopt a nom de guerre often in reference to a trade, a place or a military rank. Antoine's nom de guerre was \"dit Préfontaine\", French for \"field (pré) with a spring (fontaine)\". He arrived in New France in August 1685 and took part in Chevalier Pierre de Troyes successful raid on several English trading posts in the Hudson Bay and James Bay regions from March to October 1686 (Hudson Bay expedition (1686)). He married Marie Ronceray in 1688 in Longueuil, Québec. Antoine's only son, Adrien (1693–1760), was an important businessman and a major figure in the economic development of New France. Adrien in turn had a son by the same name, who was a slave owner and was killed at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham on September 13, 1759. By the early-to-mid-19th century, the various families descended from Antoine dropped the Fournier part of the surname in favour of Préfontaine. Two brothers from Longueuil, Québec, Alexis and Toussaint Fournier dit Préfontaine, participated in the initial engagement of the Lower Canada Rebellion, the Chambly Road incident of November 17, 1837. The rebels were inspired by the ideals of the American Revolution, republicanism and the desire for responsible and representative government. Alexis, an officer in the militia, resigned his commission the day before joining the Rebellion. When the Rebellion collapsed in November 1838, and after proudly admitting their active participation, even under the possible penalty of death or exile, both brothers were to spend a year in jail along with 1,100 other Patriotes. Two of Toussaint's sons, Raymond and François-Xavier, went on to have notable careers in their respective professions (see below). During the second half of the 19th century, several Préfontaine families emigrated from Québec to New England, the Midwest and the North-West of the United States. Others emigrated to Western Canada, notably to Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Two rivers located in the Seigneurie de Beloeil, Montérégie Region of Québec, carry the family name - Ruisseau Préfontaine (33 kilometres) and Ruisseau Préfontaine-Brodeur (32 kilometres). A neighborhood in the town of Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts, Québec is named Quartier Préfontaine.

After stints at KNBQ in Tacoma, and Seattle's KYYX and KJR, Alan came to prominence as the afternoon drive time DJ at the leading New York Top 40 radio station Z100 in the '80s. However, Z100 star DJ Scott Shannon was a fixture in the morning shift, blocking any possibility of Alan graduating to that slot. In 1989, after a successful stint in New York City, Alan was lured to leading Los Angeles Top 40 station 102.7 KIIS-FM. Alan's \"high energy\" afternoon show was again very successful in this market. In fact, by 1991, Alan's ratings had surpassed those of nationally syndicated KIIS-FM morning host Rick Dees. Alan pressed the KIIS-FM management for a promotion to the breakfast shift, but the station refused, according to Alan, because Dees was tied to a long-term contract. This impasse led to Alan being fired from KIIS-FM in October 1991, with management citing philosophical differences over the direction of his show. After a stint in San Diego, and a brief return to KIIS-FM in 1996, Alan, also known as Mr. Cigar, created OUTLAW RADIO USA broadcasting from an 1876 style Virginia City Bar built in his backyard.
