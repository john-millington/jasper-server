{"lines":[{"value":"Typhoon Vera, known as Typhoon Loleng in the Philippines, affected Okinawa, China, and South Korea during August 1986. A tropical depression formed on August 13 and attained tropical storm intensity later that day. Initially, Vera meandered in the monsoon trough. On August 17, however, the system abruptly re-formed to east-northeast, and subsequently began to move east and then north. Vera became a typhoon on August 20, and peaked in intensity two days later. Typhoon Vera then turned west-northwest and slowly weakened as it approached Okinawa. After passing near the island, Vera turned north as it tracked east of China. The typhoon made landfall on South Korea on August 28 as a tropical storm, and the next day, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The typhoon was responsible for minor damage to Okinawa, where 20,000 houses lost power and one fatality was reported. Although the core remained offshore China, over 500 homes were destroyed, 7 lives were lost, and 28 people were hurt in Shanghai. Nationwide, 1,400 power lines were cut and eight fatalities were reported. Across South Korea, a total of 1,852 structures were damaged and 384 others were destroyed, which left 6,623 people without shelter. The storm also wrecked 929 boats and damaged 37 ports. A total of 9,145 ha (22,600 acres) of farmland were flooded. Damage totaled $22 million (1986 USD). Nationwide, 26 people were killed and 81 others were injured. In addition to the aforementioned casualties, 25 individuals were feared dead after the ship New Genshine went missing.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Justin Kaohuhoomahiluainaokohalaakau Stearns (born October 13, 1974) is Associate Professor in Arab Crossroads Studies at NYU Abu Dhabi.

It is usually held on the Pentecost weekend (Pinksteren in Dutch, hence the name). Starting in 1970, at Burgemeester Damen Sportpark in the town of Geleen, PinkPop is the oldest and longest running annual dedicated pop and rock music festival in the world. Nowadays, Pinkpop is a three-day festival, from Saturday through Monday, with a 60,000 people per day capacity, and with performances on 4 separate stages. From 2006 through 2011, Pinkpop sold out six years in a row. During 44 editions, more than 2 million people have attended Pinkpop. Some 700 music acts have played at the festival. In 1994 (the 25th edition), it was decided to sell only 60,000 tickets, to prevent overcrowding due to the popularity of the festival. In 1995, it was made into a 2-day festival. Two years later, in 1997, this was further expanded to three days. 2007 saw a spin-off, later in the year, on 11 August, called Pinkpop Classic, for an older rock audience, with bands that previously performed there in past decades. This spin-off was held again in following years, with exception of 2011, in which the organisation was not able to sign enough interesting older bands. In 2008, Pinkpop was for the first time in its history not held on Pentecost weekend, which fell too early that year for the convenience of fans and performers alike. This was decided following the 2005 edition, in which the Pentecost weekend also fell early and therefore Pinkpop could not convince many great performers to come play at the festival. Sales were disappointing in 2005, so by shifting the 2008 festival, the organisation hoped to solve these problems. Pinkpop 2008 turned out to have had the largest concert attendance to date. The dates for the 2010, 2013, 2015 and 2016 edition have been shifted as well, for similar reasons.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Monte Kenton Solberg, PC (born September 17, 1958) is a Canadian businessman and politician.

The first creation, as Baron Sandys, of The Vyne, was in the Peerage of England in 1523 for William Sandys, the favourite of King Henry VIII. It passed through several generations of his descendants until it fell into abeyance circa 1683 at the death of the eighth Baron, in which state it has remained since. The second creation, as Baron Sandys, of Ombersley in the County of Worcester was in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1743 for Samuel Sandys, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer. This title became extinct on the death of his son Edwin, the second Baron, in 1797. The family estates were inherited by Edwin's niece Mary Hill, Marchioness of Downshire, widow of Arthur Hill, 2nd Marquess of Downshire. The third creation, again as Baron Sandys, of Ombersley in the County of Worcester was in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1802 for Mary Hill, Marchioness of Downshire, widow of Arthur Hill, 2nd Marquess of Downshire. The barony was created with remainder to her younger sons Lord Arthur Moyses William Hill, Lord Marcus Hill, Lord Augustus Hill and Lord George Hill successively, and failing them to her eldest son Arthur Blundell Hill, 3rd Marquess of Downshire. She was succeeded according to the special remainder by her second son Lord Arthur Moyses William, the second Baron. He was a Lieutenant-General in the Army and also represented County Down in the House of Commons. He never married and was succeeded by his next brother, the third Baron. He sat as Member of Parliament for Newry and Evesham. In 1861 Lord Sandys assumed by Royal licence the surname of Sandys in lieu of Hill. This line of the family failed on the death of his younger son, the fifth Baron, in 1904. The late Baron was succeeded by his second cousin once removed, the sixth Baron. He was the grandson of Lord George Hill, fifth son of the first Baroness. The sixth baron's son, the seventh Baron, succeeded in 1961. Lord Sandys notably served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard between 1979 and 1983 in the Conservative administration of Margaret Thatcher. However, he lost his seat in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act of 1999. He died on 11 February 2013 and was succeeded in the peerage, under the terms of the special remainder, by the ninth Marquess of Downshire. The family seat is Ombersley Court in Ombersley near Droitwich in Worcestershire. The traditional burial place of the family is the Sandys Mausoleum in the churchyard of St Andrew, Ombersley. When St Andrew's Church was built in its current form between 1825 and 1829, the chancel of the old church was adapted for use as mausoleum for the Sandys family, who were lords of the manor.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Robert Atkinson Davis (March 9, 1841 – January 7, 1903) was a businessman and Manitoba politician who served as the fourth Premier of Manitoba. Davis was born in Dudswell, in the eastern townships of Lower Canada (now Quebec). As a young man, he worked in the mining fields of the US Rockies. He moved to Red River on 10 May 1870, and reportedly had a friendly meeting with Louis Riel shortly before the end of the Red River Rebellion. This meeting took place after Davis swam across the Red River to where Riel was hiding and called out to the guards in French, and the entire meeting took place in French as Davis was bilingual. Davis purchased a hotel in September 1870. This investment proved very profitable, and he was soon able to open several other stores in Winnipeg. Davis assumed a significant role in Manitoba politics after the death of his first wife in 1872. He emerged as a spokesman for the province's recent Ontario immigrants, who opposed the Hudson's Bay Company's monopoly on transportation and opposed the continued prominence of the Métis in Manitoba politics. Davis challenged HBC commissioner Donald Alexander Smith for the Presidency of the Provincial Agricultural Association in 1872. He lost this race, but was elected to both the Protestant school board and the new Winnipeg Board of Trade in February 1873. Davis also helped create the Manitoba society called \"The Grange\" in 1874. In April 1874, Davis won a by-election to the provincial legislature for the riding of Winnipeg & St. Johns (replacing Smith, who had resigned). He soon emerged as leading figure in the opposition, and on July 2, 1874, supported a non-confidence motion which brought down the government. The next day, Marc-Amable Girard was called to lead a ministry based on principles of \"responsible government\". Davis became the Provincial Treasurer, and sought to achieve debt elimination and \"better terms\" from Ottawa. The Girard government fell apart in November–December 1874 as a result of ethnic tensions. Davis, the only minister not to resign during this crisis, was called upon to form a new government. Like his predecessors, he recognized the importance of demographic balance and appointed French-Canadian Joseph Royal as his Provincial Secretary. Davis was re-elected for Winnipeg in Manitoba's second general election (December 30, 1874), defeating Thomas Scott (not to be confused with the Thomas Scott executed by Louis Riel's provisional government) by 198 votes to 183. His ministry won the support of the \"French party\", but did not attain an overall majority in parliament until Davis formed a new alliance with former minister John Norquay. The Davis government was primarily opposed by the anglophone allies of John Christian Schultz, who were led in parliament by Orangeman Francis Cornish. Through his alliance with Royal, Davis could count on support from the \"French party\" throughout his term in office. As Premier, Davis continued his policy of debt reduction (for which he attained an increased Federal subsidy), and convinced the unelected Legislative Council to vote itself out of existence in January 1876. He supported a proposal that the planned transcontinental railway run through Winnipeg rather than Selkirk. After John A. Macdonald was re-elected as Canada's Prime Minister in 1878, this change was accomplished. Davis resigned as Premier in 1878, and subsequently became a successful businessman in Chicago. He argued in favour of Canada–US free trade in 1883, and spent much of the 1890s travelling on the profits of his business. He died of Bright's Disease in 1903 in Phoenix, Arizona.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Tom Lawson (born September 15, 1979) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender.

Such fees are thereby reduced for those who have lower incomes, or alternatively, less money to spare after their personal expenses, regardless of income. Sliding scale fees are a form of price discrimination or differential pricing. A business or organization may have various motivations for pricing a product or service on a sliding scale. These may include the desire to be charitable to those less able to afford the product or service, their ability to get a tax deduction for offering their services as charity, their ability to benefit from the revenue even from a partial payment, their retention of a longtime customer/client, or referrals that such a customer/client may provide. For example, medical fees may depend on a patient's income. Andrew Carnegie imposed this on his workers during the Homestead Strike. Some child-adoption agencies collect legal fees (normally very expensive) on a sliding scale, so that couples across a wider range of incomes are able to adopt children. Sliding-scale fees are also often charged by lawyers, places of worship, and for tuition at educational institutions.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Pizza Margherita is a typical Neapolitan pizza, made with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella fior di latte, fresh basil, salt and extra-virgin olive oil.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"This article is a collection of Numismatic and coin collecting terms with concise explanation for the beginner or professional.

(now Apple Inc.) from 1996 to 1998 as part of their PowerBook series of Macintosh computers. Introduced in November 1996 at a starting price of $2499, it was the first new PowerBook after the controversial PowerBook 5300. After the introduction of the more powerful PowerBook 3400 in February 1997, the 1400 took on the role of Apple's entry level notebook and remained there until its discontinuation in May 1998. Its successor, the PowerBook G3 Series (i.e. - \"Wallstreet\"/\"Mainstreet\") would ultimately go on to replace and consolidate not only the 1400, but the 2400 and 3400 as well. Throughout its 18 months on the market, the PowerBook 1400 was available in a number of different configurations. It was originally released with a 117 MHz PowerPC 603e processor; a 133 MHz processor was added in July 1997, and the line topped out with a 166 MHz processor the following December. Each version was available as either a \"c\" or a \"cs\" model, differentiated largely by type of LCD technology used. While both models came with 11.3\" color displays with 800 x 600 resolution, the pricier 1400c came equipped with an active matrix display and the 1400cs came with a less expensive passive matrix, dual-scan display. The optional 6x CD-ROM was implemented using a sleep-swappable module system similar to the one pioneered by the PowerBook 5300; other modules included a Zip drive and the standard 1.4 MB floppy (an 8x CD-ROM would eventually become standard on the 133 MHz model). A pioneering feature of the 1400 was the \"BookCover\" laptop skin which allowed owners the opportunity to give their PowerBook a customized look. Every 1400 shipped with a gray cover, a clear cover, and six inserts; a ClarisWorks template was also included as an \"extra\" on the system restore CD, from which users could design their own BookCover. The 1400 was easily upgradeable. System memory modules could be \"piggy-backed\" onto each other (another feature unique to the 1400), allowing the use of additional RAM. The CPU was located on a removable daughter card, which could be replaced with one containing a faster processor, including a number of commercially available cards with PowerPC G3 processors from vendors such as Sonnet Technologies, NewerTech, and Vimage. Aside from its two PC Card slots, the 1400 also included an internal expansion slot. Although few applications were ever developed to utilize it, Apple did release their own branded video card which included an increased amount of VRAM and an external video port. Other devices included a third-party video card, as well as a relatively rare Ethernet networking card. There are several well-known issues concerning the PowerBook 1400. Like all other PowerBooks prior to the PowerBook G4, the drive controller used in the 1400 is incompatible with ATA-6 hard drives. Compatibility issues could also arise with hard drives larger than 8.2GB, resolvable by partitioning the boot drive to less than 8.2 GB or by using Mac OS 8.6 or later. Additionally, unlike all Apple notebooks to come after it, the 1400 would not boot from a CD by holding down the \"C\" key while starting the machine; the only workarounds for this were selecting the CD in the Startup Disk control panel before rebooting, or pressing the Command-Opt-Shift-Del keys. According to Low End Mac the 117 MHz model is a \"compromised Mac\" due to the lack of a level 2 cache.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Joseph Haule (born December 29, 1975), popularly known as Professor Jay, is a Tanzanian hip hop artist and member of the Tanzanian parliament for Mikumi constituency.

These factors have contributed to a transport system that is highly dependent on private motor vehicles. Several motorways radiating to the north, northwest, southwest and south act as the backbone of the city's road network, with the busiest section of motorway carrying over 200,000 vehicles a day. Public transport use in Auckland was high until the 1950s but subsequently declined during the second half of the 20th century, before experiencing a strong resurgence over the past 15 years.

For most of the Seven Years' War Spain remained neutral, turning down both the French and British, but during the war's latter stages, the Spanish became alarmed at the threat posed by the British to their colonies as French losses mounted. In anticipation of the Spanish entering the war on the French side, the British attacked Spanish colonies. In August 1762 a British expedition against Cuba took Havana and western Cuba, then a month later the British seized Manila.

For the second time since the series' premiere, the contestants selected the tribes instead of the producers. The self-selection into two tribes of nine left two contestants not chosen and immediately eliminated from the game. The two tribes were named Ulong (named after Ulong Island, one of Palau's tourist spots) and Koror (named after the capital city of Palau at the time). In the game, Koror dominated from the very beginning, winning every immunity challenge and all but three reward challenges. Mid-game, having survived alone at Ulong after the entirety of her tribe had been voted out or eliminated at tribal councils, remaining member Stephenie LaGrossa received a map to Koror.

Byrd (T-AKE-4)' is a Lewis and Clark-class dry cargo ship in the United States Navy. She is the second United States Navy ship to be named after polar explorer Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd (1888–1957). The contract to build her was awarded to National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO) of San Diego, California, on 18 July 2003. She was launched from the building ways into the San Diego Bay on the evening of 15 May 2007; Bolling Byrd Clarke, Admiral Byrd's eldest daughter, broke the ceremonial bottle of champagne on the ship's bow to start the launch amid fireworks and fanfare. Construction continued until the U.S. Navy accepted her on 14 November 2007. Additional construction work continued until she was delivered to Military Sealift Command (MSC) for crewing and placed in service on 8 January 2008. She completed a fitting-out period as well multiple operational inspections and trials, including a full INSURV inspection on 27 March 2008. A final period of modifications and design alterations was completed during a 70-day availability before full fleet introduction on 25 July 2008. The ship joined the Pacific Fleet and predominantly operates in the Far East and Indian Ocean operation areas. In May 2009, Richard E. Byrd was identified to conduct Pacific Partnership 2009 as a last minute replacement for the USS Dubuque (LPD-8), which was sidelined due to an outbreak of H1N1 virus. Pacific Partnership 2009 visited American Samoa, Tonga, New Caledonia, Kiribati (Tarawa), and the Marshall Islands from June to September. In the few weeks after being selected, the ship was outfitted with a quick-designed Reverse Osmosis Unit to make sufficient clean water while loitering in the remote waters and additional logistical items were brought aboard. Byrd embarked PHIBRON2 and staff, several NGOs, and allied partners during an at-sea transfer from USNS Amelia Earhart (T-AKE-6).

It was probably originally raised in Gallia Aquitania in the reign of founder-emperor Augustus after the revolt of the Aquitani was suppressed in 26 BC. Unlike most Gauls, the Aquitani were not Celtic-speaking but spoke Aquitanian, a now extinct non Indo-European language closely related to Basque. The regiment was also known as cohors II Biturigum. The Bituriges were a Celtic-speaking tribe whose territory was included in Gallia Aquitania. It is believed that when the Aquitani regiments were originally raised (probably in two series), some were made up of mixed Aquitani and Bituriges recruits. The regiment was probably stationed on the Rhine frontier from an early stage. It first appears in the datable epigraphic record in Germania Superior (Pfalz/Alsace) in 82 AD. Not later than 116 it was transferred to Raetia (Germany S of Danube). It was still in Raetia on its last attested date, 166. There is no certain information as to which forts it occupied in Raetia.  The origins of the three attested personnel are unknown. The honorific title civium Romanorum (c.R. for short) first appears in the record in 116. It was normally awarded by the emperor for valour to an auxiliary regiment as a whole. The award would include the grant of Roman citizenship to all the regiment's men, but not to subsequent recruits to the regiment. The regiment, however, would retain the prestigious title in perpetuity. Until 212, only a minority of the empire's inhabitants (inc. all Italians) held full Roman citizenship. The rest were denoted peregrini, a second-class status. Since the legions admitted only citizens, peregrini could only enlist in the auxilia. Citizenship carried a number of tax and other privileges and was highly sought-after.

In his last season at school Heygate scored 599 runs in nine innings (two not out) at an average of 85.57, which was regarded as exceptional given his limited support despite the fact that Epsom never played the strongest cricket schools. For 1902, Heygate was sought after by both Sussex and W.G. Grace’s London County team, but he played only ten matches, all for Sussex in May and August. Only with an innings of 95 against Gloucestershire did Heygate live up to his Epson form, and he had a very modest average of 16.06 from seventeen innings. In 1903 on his sole appearance for London County, Heygate played a fine innings of 61 not out to help Sussex teammate Ranjitsinhji orchestrate an unlikely victory over Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and averaged 27 for ten innings in a very wet summer for Sussex despite playing no innings higher than 55. In 1904, Heygate was disappointing apart from a score of 72 at The Oval, and owing to medical duties he was not seen even once in first-class cricket between 1905 and 1908, yet in 1909 and 1910 Reginald Heygate managed to spare the time to play a full season for Sussex. In each of those two years he scored just over a thousand runs, despite both summers being wet and unfavourable to Heygate’s style, which depended upon hard hitting in front of the wicket to an extent considered \"old-fashioned\" by contemporary observers. Heygate’s moderate defence on the sticky wickets common in his two full seasons explains why he failed in his one appearance for the Gentlemen on a Lord’s wicket where shooters were more common at Lord's than at any time since the heavy roller was introduced in the 1870s. The hot and dry 1911 season, which would have suited his style much better, saw Heygate’s work as a doctor take up more of his time, and he could play only twice that season and not at all subsequently. He did however continue to play regularly for the Winsborough Green club until 1918, and was that club’s president until 1932.

It is understood that bias may be intentional or subconscious, thus no dishonesty is implied by blinding. If both tester and subject are blinded, the trial is called a double-blind experiment. Blind testing is used wherever items are to be compared without influences from testers' preferences or expectations, for example in clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of medicinal drugs and procedures without placebo effect, observer bias, or conscious deception; and comparative testing of commercial products to objectively assess user preferences without being influenced by branding and other properties not being tested. Blinding can be imposed on researchers, technicians, or subjects. The opposite of a blind trial is an open trial. Blind experiments are an important tool of the scientific method, in many fields of research—medicine, psychology and the social sciences, natural sciences such as physics and biology, applied sciences such as market research, and many others. In some disciplines, such as medicinal drug testing, blind experiments are considered essential. In some cases, while blind experiments would be useful, they are impractical or unethical; an example is in the field of developmental psychology: although it would be informative to raise children under arbitrary experimental conditions, such as on a remote island with a fabricated enculturation, it is a violation of ethics and human rights. The terms blind (adjective) or to blind (transitive verb) when used in this sense are figurative extensions of the literal idea of blindfolding someone. The terms masked or to mask may be used for the same concept; this is commonly the case in ophthalmology, where the word 'blind' is often used in the literal sense. Some argue that the use of the term \"blind\" for academic review or experiments is offensive and prefer the alternate term \"masked\" or \"anonymous\".","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Message discipline is the concept that politicians and other public policy advocates should talk about what is relevant to achieve their aims, and not allow themselves to be sidetracked either by their own thoughts or the questions of press or audience. The term is finding its way into business, both in advertising and internal communications. When a politician repeats the same thing ad nauseam, or uses a question on one subject as a launching point to talk about a different subject, he or she is said to be exercising message discipline. Message discipline may involve a subordination of irrelevant personal opinions, or a subordination of fluctuating desires to say what others want to hear versus maintaining an unwavering devotion to the message as it reaches out to greater numbers of potential audience members. Message discipline is often practiced around wedge issues. Devolving to talking points (practicing message discipline) around issues such as same-sex marriage or abortion rights can be a powerful weapon in the politician's arsenal, either clouding a difficult line of questioning from an interviewer, or motivating the candidates' base to vote. Key to defining wedge issues and practicing message discipline are the selection of terms that low-information voters will rally around. In a business context, message discipline is the practice of reducing and managing the number of messages going from headquarters and marketing functions to field organizations as well as front-line employees. This goal-oriented, structured, strategic communication, is believed to drive operational excellence in organizations, as it reduces the clutter and mixed messages that sometimes afflict communications through organizational layers.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Anthony Barness (born 25 February 1973) is an English former professional footballer who played as a defender from 1991 until 2011.

For centuries, Navy Island existed as a narrow, oval shaped hunk of rock sitting roughly at the turning point of the harbour where the deep open water ends and the harbour approaches the Reversing Falls. However, the island ceased to exist in its traditional form when the construction of the Saint John Harbour Bridge linked the island to the mainland in the 1970s. The island now sits under the western footing of the bridge, and is survived in name by the Navy Island Forest Products Terminal, operated by the Port of Saint John. When Samuel de Champlain visited Saint John in 1604, the island was the location of a native Maliseet settlement named Ouigoudi.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Stadium Arcadium World Tour was a 2006–2007 concert tour by the band Red Hot Chili Peppers in support of their ninth studio album, Stadium Arcadium.

Creatures by the name of \"orca\" or \"orc\" have appeared throughout the history of Western literature. In Ludovico Ariosto's epic poem Orlando Furioso, the orca (sometimes translated orc) was a sea-monster from whom the damsel Angelica was rescued by Orlando. This killer whale-like sea monster also appears in Michael Drayton's epic poem Polyolbion and in John Milton's Paradise Lost. The animal was known to Herman Melville, who nonetheless already had his antagonist in the sperm whale in his work Moby-Dick, and it was not until the 1970s that it was seen as a monster. As late as the 1970s, killer whales were at times depicted negatively in fiction as ravenous predators whose behavior caused heroes to interfere to help a prey animal escape. The poorly received film Orca features the story of a male killer whale going on what appears to be a vengeful rampage after his pregnant mate is killed by humans; yet at the same time, the film shows the killer whale having the intelligence needed both for vengeance and at the film's end, seemingly for forgiveness. In contrast, the 1974 Walt Disney produced motion picture The Island at the Top of the World portrayed killer whales as bloodthirsty hunters of the protagonists in one particularly brutal scene. In Jaws (1975), the name of the boat used to hunt the great white shark is the Orca, given the killer whale's status as a known predator of the shark. However, in the sequel Jaws 2, the shark's first victim is a killer whale, which was probably intended more as a Hollywood joke than an accurate portrayal of the eating habits of great white sharks. In recent years, increased research and the animal's popularity in public venues has brought about a dramatic rehabilitation of the killer whale's image, much as the North American wolf's image has been changed. It is now widely seen as a respected predator posing little or no threat to humans. The Free Willy films (1993, 1995, 1997, 2010) present killer whales as victims of captivity, oil spills and poaching, and were influential in changing public attitudes to captive marine mammals. Following the success of the first of these, Free Willy, the movie's captive star Keiko was returned to the coast of his native Iceland. The Japanese anime series Damekko Doubutsu features a killer whale in a humorous and ironic context: unable to swim without a flotation device. The 2006 Australian animated children's film Happy Feet portrayed two male killer whales as both powerful and intelligent playful predators and also as victims of human-caused ecological disruptions in a heavily polluted hunting ground. One of the killer whales sports massive propeller scars on its back and shies away in fear from a large fishing vessel. The killer whale's behaviour was dramatically exaggerated, yet based on genuine behaviours such as spyhopping, iceberg tipping and kicking and tossing of prey. The 1995 film The Pebble and the Penguin, the 1984 film Samson and Sally and the 2006 film Happy Feet both also featured killer whales as antagonists. Blackfish is a 2013 American documentary film directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite. It concerns Tilikum, an orca held by SeaWorld and the controversy over captive killer whales. The film premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2013, and was picked up by Magnolia Pictures and CNN Films for wider release. It was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary. A popular Internet video shows a killer whale appearing to jump on a group of kayakers. The event shown is a fake used in an advertisement for a sports drink. The Whale is a 2011 documentary film directed by Suzanne Chisholm and Michael Parfit. Narrated by Ryan Reynolds, it tells the story of Luna, a killer whale (orca) living in Nootka Sound, Canada, who was separated from his pod at a young age. Killer Whales: Wolves of the Sea - BBC Documentary - Sir David Attenborough Published on Jul 20, 2015 Killer Whales: Wolves of the Sea, Journeys With Wildlife, BBC - Documentary Throughout every ocean on earth. killer whales are the masters of the sea. Like wolves on land, these fearsome predators often hunt in packs. English-speaking scientists most often use the term \"killer whale\", although the term \"orca\" is increasingly used. Killer whale advocates point out it has a long heritage. Indeed, the genus name Orcinus means \"of the kingdom of the dead\". Killer whales are apex predators, meaning that they themselves have no natural predators. They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea, because they hunt in groups like wolf packs. Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish, cephalopods, mammals, sea birds and sea turtles. However, different populations or species tend to specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on certain prey species. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRWl77tK7Bg The 2013 video game Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies features a performing killer whale being tried in court. The killer whale, which is referred to mostly as an orca, is defended by the titular character Phoenix Wright on the charge of killing its owner. In the second trial day the killer whale is cross-examined via telecast, although her testimony consists completely of whale noises. She is eventually proven innocent of all killings. Interesting, the episode seems to have the message that just because killer whales can't talk it doesn't mean they don't have feelings and a right to be heard as an undertone. Killer Whale Attack ( Documentary ) Published on Jul 21, 2016 The killer whale or orca (Orcinus orca) is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family, of which it is the largest member. Killer whales are found in all oceans, from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas. Killer whales have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and dolphins. They have been known to attack baleen whale calves, and even adult whales. Killer whales are apex predators, as there is no animal which preys on them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAaHUg0wSzo","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"WKZY (92.9 FM) is an American radio station, licensed to Chilton, Wisconsin, and transmitting from the Lake Winnebago community of Stockbridge to provide a city-grade signal to both Oshkosh and the Fox Cities.
