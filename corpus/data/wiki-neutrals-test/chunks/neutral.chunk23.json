He was a Staff attorney for the North Carolina Attorney General's Office from 1940 to 1942. He was in the United States Navy Senior Lieutenant during World War II, from 1942 to 1946. He was in private practice in Charlotte, North Carolina from 1946 to 1968. He was a Judge pro tem on the Charlotte City Court, Charlotte from 1947 to 1951. He was a Lecturer at the University of North Carolina School of Law from 1975 to 1979. He was a Lecturer at the University of Florida College of Law from 1979 to 1980. For many years, he returned to Harvard, where he had won the Ames Moot Court Competition, to teach a short course. McMillan was a federal judge on the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. McMillan was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson on April 25, 1968, to a seat vacated by Wilson Warlick. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 6, 1968, and received his commission on June 7, 1968. In the spring of 1970, McMillan became one of the first U.S district court judges to explicitly approve busing as a remedy for racially segregated schools. In the case, McMillan also set racial balance as a standard by which progress in desegregation could be measured. Instantly controversial, McMillan received death threats due to his opinion, and needed to be placed under police protection. The case (Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education) soon reached the Supreme Court, where it was the subject of intense debate and negotiations among the justices. Eventually, a unanimous Court ruled to uphold McMillan's orders. McMillan achieved temporary fame in the aftermath of this decision, appearing in newspapers across the country, including The New York Times. The best-selling book on the Supreme Court, THE BRETHREN, discussed Justice Byron White's fascination with McMillan's opinion, based in close and concise facts. While considering the case, McMillan visited every public school in the entire district, to gain an immediate sense of the places involved in the decision, and calculated the school-bus-miles per average student before and after his decision. Fewer child-bus-miles resulted.

By plotting the change in molecular orbital levels of a molecule as a function of geometrical change, Walsh diagrams explain why molecules are more stable in certain spatial configurations (e.g. why water adopts a bent conformation). A major application of Walsh diagrams is to explain the regularity in structure observed for related molecules having identical numbers of valence electrons (e.g. why H 2 O and H 2 S look similar), and to account for how molecules alter their geometries as their number of electrons or spin state changes. Additionally, Walsh diagrams can be used to predict distortions of molecular geometry from knowledge of how the LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) affects the HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) when the molecule experiences geometrical perturbation. Walsh's rule for predicting shapes of molecules states that a molecule will adopt a structure that best provides the most stability for its HOMO. If a particular structural change does not perturb the HOMO, the closest occupied molecular orbital governs the preference for geometrical orientation.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Smedby AIS is a Swedish football club located in Norrköping.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Whitehall is a location in Clarke County, Georgia.

The piano nobile apartment was inhabited by Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning between 1847 and Mrs Browning's death in 1861. Their only child, Robert Barrett Browning (known as Pen) was born there in 1849. Casa Guidi was the subject for her 1851 collection of poems \"Casa Guidi Windows\". The Browning household was a centre of British society in Florence although it was said that Theodosia Trollope's house was more care free. There was no animosity however and the Trollope's daughter played with the Browning's son Robert, known as Pen. After Pen's death in 1912 the apartment was bought by several Browning enthusiasts. By that time, Casa Guidi was in poor shape, and the apartment retained hardly any furniture or paintings. The Browning Society in New York restored it, before giving it to Eton College which undertook further work so that the building could be used as a study centre. Today, it is part of The Eton College Collections, but is administered by the Landmark Trust, who also look after the apartment above the one where John Keats died in Rome. When not being used by Eton boys, the property is available for holiday lets booked through the Landmark Trust. Casa Guidi is open to the public for 3:00–6:00 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from April to November.

Normally there are three entrances to the stage (Palmyra has five) including a grand central entrance, known as the porta regia or \"royal door\". The form may have been intended to resemble the facades of imperial palaces. The scaenae frons is often two and sometimes three stories in height and was central to the theatre's visual impact for this was what was seen by a Roman audience at all times. Tiers or balconies were supported by an exuberant display of columns, normally in the Corinthian order, often originally including many statues in niches. In smaller theatres it could support a permanent roof, enclosing the whole theatre, and in larger ones awnings over the whole or parts of the theatre, perhaps secured to masts rising above it, for which there is some evidence. This form was influenced by Greek theatre, which had an equivalent but simpler skene building (meaning \"tent\", showing the original nature of it). This led to the stage or space \"before the skene\" being called the \"proscenium\". In the Hellenistic period the skene became more elaborate, perhaps with columns, but also used to support painted secenery. The Roman scaenae frons was also used both as the backdrop to the stage and behind as the actors' dressing room. It no longer supported painted sets in the Greek manner but relied for effect on elaborate permanent architectural decoration. This achieved a baroque effect also seen in large nymphaea and library facades, often with an undulating facade, pushing forward and then retreating. All the significant examples date from the Imperial period; the Theatre of Pompey in Rome, completed in 55 BC, was the first stone theatre in Rome, and probably launched the style. An inscription in the entablature above the lowest columns often recorded the emperor and others who had helped to fund the construction. A feature often found in the Western Empire, but less so in the Greek-speaking areas, was the row of curved recesses in the face of the front of the stage, as at Sabratha and Leptis Magna. The roofed Renaissance Teatro Olimpico (\"Olympic Theatre\") in Vicenza, northern Italy (1580-1585, designed by Andrea Palladio) includes a fully decorated scaenae frons and gives a good general impression of what the Roman ones would have looked like in their original state, though it is in stucco over a wood framework. The theatre is also famous for the trompe-l'œil scenery, designed by Vincenzo Scamozzi, behind the scaenae frons, which gives the appearance of long streets receding to a distant horizon; it is not clear how much this reflects ancient practice. This was intended to be temporary in 1585, but remains in excellent condition.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Anna Adams Gordon (July 21, 1853 – June 15, 1931) was an American social reformer, songwriter, and, as national president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union when the Eighteenth Amendment was adopted, a major figure in the Temperance movement.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Przysieka () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Wągrowiec, within Wągrowiec County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, in west-central Poland.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"A horseshoe moustache, also known as a biker moustache, is a full moustache with vertical extensions grown on the corners of the lips and down the sides of the mouth to the jawline, resembling an upside-down U or a horseshoe.

After it was suggested the type specimen of \"T. arntzeni\" belonged in fact to the Macedonian crested newt (''T. macedonicus), the species was redescribed, with a new type specimen, as T. ivanbureschi'' in 2013. The species epithet was chosen in honour of Bulgarian herpetologist Ivan Buresh. Its distribution ranges from the Southeastern Balkan peninsula (Western Macedonia, Northwestern Greece, Bulgaria, Eastern Thrace) to Western Anatolia. An isolated population, surrounded by other crested newt species, occurs in Serbia. Genetic data showed that Northern Anatolian populations east of the Bosphorus and Bursa form a separate, but morphologically indistinguishable sibling species, which was described as Anatolian crested newt (''T. anatolicus'') in 2016. The Balkan crested newt hybridises with the Anatolian crested newt at its eastern range end.

A classical example of literature on secular ethics is the Kural text, authored by the ancient Indian philosopher Valluvar who lived during the 1st century BCE. Secular ethical systems comprise a wide variety of ideas to include the normativity of social contracts, some form of attribution of intrinsic moral value, intuition-based deontology, cultural moral relativism, and the idea that scientific reasoning can reveal objective moral truth (known as science of morality). Secular ethics frameworks are not always mutually exclusive from theological values. For example, the Golden Rule or a commitment to non-violence, could be supported by both religious and secular frameworks.

The competition was started in 1988 and covers a 21-mile (34 km) course on the tidal Thames between Ham, London and Greenwich. It is usually held on a Saturday in September. Since 2009 the race has been run in the opposite direction, i.e. upstream with the tide from Greenwich to Ham. This appears to be the preferred arrangement for the organisers and the competitors alike. The rules stipulate that boats must be moved by oars or paddles and have a cox and a passenger (although both cox and passenger may alternate with rowers during the race). Up to 300 boats take part including Gigs, Skiffs, Celtic Longboats, Cutters, Currachs, Dragon Boats, Whaleboats and an assortment of novelty craft. Boats are handicapped by class to provide an overall competition as well as competitions by class. As handicapping is on a slowest-away first basis, this makes for a lively race. The race attracts serious racers as well as leisure rowers, making it a water-based equivalent of the London Marathon, and an interesting and colourful spectacle for the many who come to watch from the bridges and river banks. Every boat is required to carry a flag, and the prizes include one for fancy dress. Since 2008, all crews taking part have been equipped with a GPS tracking system which allows both race organisers and members of the public to track the progress of competitors throughout the race by logging on to the Great River Race website. The race is dependent on the tide and was originally rowed downstream on the outgoing tide. In 2009, the Great River Race was for the first time rowed upstream on an incoming tide. Competitors rowed from Docklands Sailing Club at Millwall upstream to Ham Landing near Ham House. The 2010 race took place on Saturday 25 September, was again run upstream and featured a challenge by a crew from ITN London News issued to their counterparts in BBC London News. The ITN crew took part in a C8 Canadian canoe while the BBC team rowed a Thames Watermen's Cutter.

As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough's population was 968,  reflecting a decline of 270 (-21.8%) from the 1,238 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 12 (+1.0%) from the 1,226 counted in the 1990 Census. Bay Head is situated on the Barnegat Peninsula, also known as Barnegat Bay Island, a long, narrow barrier island that separates Barnegat Bay from the Atlantic Ocean. Together with Mantoloking, Bay Head is considered part of the Jersey Shore's \"Gold Coast\". Bay Head was incorporated as a Borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on June 15, 1886, from portions of Brick Township, based on the results of a referendum held three days earlier. The community was supposed to have been named \"Bayhead\" after the Bayhead Land Company that developed the area in the 1870s. A railroad sign posted in the 1880s labeled the station as \"Bay Head,\" and the name stuck when the borough was incorporated in 1886. The name also comes from the town's location, which is at the \"head\" of Barnegat Bay.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Two Gentlemen of Verona is a comedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written between 1589 and 1593. It is considered by some to be Shakespeare's first play, and is often seen as showing his first tentative steps in laying out some of the themes and motifs with which he would later deal in more detail; for example, it is the first of his plays in which a heroine dresses as a boy. The play deals with the themes of friendship and infidelity, the conflict between friendship and love, and the foolish behaviour of people in love. The highlight of the play is considered by some to be Launce, the clownish servant of Proteus, and his dog Crab, to whom \"the most scene-stealing non-speaking role in the canon\" has been attributed. Two Gentlemen is often regarded as one of Shakespeare's weakest plays.

The song initially leaked into the internet in early October 2002 prior to the official release, prompting radio to play the track. It was released commercially as a single on October 22 by Maverick Records and was later included on the singer's ninth studio album, American Life (2003), and her greatest hits compilation, Celebration (2009). Following the release of the previous Bond single, \"The World Is Not Enough\", MGM wanted a high-profile artist for the theme of Die Another Day, and Madonna was their choice. She wrote and produced the song with Mirwais Ahmadzaï while French composer Michel Colombier was enlisted as composer. While developing, the track went through numerous changes. After Madonna saw the initial version of the film she adapted the song to its theme, described as a metaphor for destroying one's ego. Ahmadzaï re-arranged \"Die Another Day\" at his home in Paris while Colombier finished the string sections in Los Angeles. An electroclash number, \"Die Another Day\" is a mixture of strings and interpolating electronic swirls, and stuttered editing on Madonna's voice, cutting the main signal on the chorus. \"Die Another Day\" received mixed responses from music critics; one group of reviewers favored its departure from traditional Bond soundtracks, while others panned its production and called it uninteresting. It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and two Grammy Awards for Best Dance Recording and Best Short Form Music Video. The song was a commercial success, peaking at number eight on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was the top selling dance song in the US for both 2002 and 2003. \"Die Another Day\" reached the top of the charts in Canada, Italy, Romania and Spain and top-ten in a number of countries worldwide. The music video was directed by Traktor, and was developed as an independent video from the film but contained Bond influences. It depicts Madonna as a prisoner in a torture chamber, alternating with scenes of a fencing duel between good (clad in white) and evil (clad in black) personas of the singer. Wounds inflicted on both fencers are mirrored on the imprisoned Madonna, and in the end she escapes being electrocuted in the chamber. The usage of Jewish religious texts and objects in the music video led to controversy, with scholars of Judaism deeming it sacrilegious. Madonna has included the song on two of her world tours; the first being the 2004 Re-Invention World Tour and again as a video interlude on the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Dringhouses is a suburb, formerly a village, in York, England and includes the area known as Woodthorpe.

In modern terms, it identifies tractable problems with the complexity class P. Formally, to say that a problem can be solved in polynomial time is to say that there exists an algorithm that, given an n-bit instance of the problem as input, can produce a solution in time O(n c ), where c is a constant that depends on the problem but not the particular instance of the problem. Alan Cobham's 1965 paper entitled \"The intrinsic computational difficulty of functions\" is one of the earliest mentions of the concept of the complexity class P, consisting of problems decidable in polynomial time. Cobham theorized that this complexity class was a good way to describe the set of feasibly computable problems.

It is based on KIGAM VP 200801, an articulated series of 36 caudal vertebrae associated with partial hind limbs and ischia. This specimen was found in a sandstone block that had been incorporated into the Tando dam at Hwaseong City; the way the specimen is cut off suggests that more of it was present before quarrying. The dam was built in 1994, and the bones were first brought to the attention of paleontologists in 2008, after a public official noticed them. The specimen probably came from the lower Tando beds. The upper part of this informally named formation dates to 103 ± 0.5 million years ago. Koreaceratops was described by Yuong-Nam Lee and colleagues in 2011. The genus name is a combination of \"Korea\" and the Greek κέρας (keras) meaning 'horn' and ὄψις (opsis) meaning 'face'. The type species is ''K. hwaseongensis'', named after Hwaseong City. Koreaceratops is notable for the tall neural spines on its caudal vertebrae, and for the structure of its astragalus. In some of the distal caudal vertebrae, the neural spines are over five times the height of the vertebral centra to which they attach. Lee et al. noted that several other ceratopsians also had tall neural spines on their caudals. As this trait appears in several branches of ceratopsians, Lee et al. postulated that the feature was independently evolved, perhaps as an adaptation for swimming. Lee et al. performed a phylogenetic analysis and found Koreaceratops to be positioned between Archaeoceratops and more derived ceratopsians.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Editum editoides is a moth of the Micronoctuidae family.

When the allegation was made, Farrow and Allen had been in a 12-year relationship and had three children together: two adopted children, Dylan and Moses, and one biological son, Satchel (now known as Ronan Farrow). The assault is alleged to have taken place eight months after Farrow learned that Allen had been having an affair with another of her adoptive daughters, Soon-Yi Previn, who married Allen in 1997; Previn was a first-year undergraduate when Farrow found out about the relationship. Allen alleges that the affair prompted Mia Farrow to concoct the assault allegation as an act of vengeance. The Connecticut State's Attorney investigated the allegation but did not press charges, and the New York Department of Social Services found \"no credible evidence\" to support it. In response to the allegation, Allen sued Farrow for sole custody of Dylan, Satchel and Moses. He lost the case in June 1993; the judge denied him visitation rights with Dylan, gave him limited, supervised visitation with Satchel, and allowed Moses, a teenager, to decide for himself. The decision was upheld on appeal in 1994 and 1995. Dylan Farrow has repeated the allegation several times as an adult.

The film stars Joel McCrea and Betty Field, and features Harry Carey, William Demarest, Franklin Pangborn and Porter Hall. The movie was filmed in 1942 but not released for over two years, and the released version differed from what Preston Sturges had wished, although he publicly accepted the film as his own. Paramount Pictures disliked the film Sturges had made, and pulled it from his control, re-titled and re-edited it, in the process making it (especially in the early segment) more confusing for the audience to understand. The studio's released version was marketed in a way that made it appear to be one of Sturges' comedies. The film was not well received by the critics or the public, and marked the end of a sustained run of success for Sturges, who had already left Paramount by the time the film was released. Although rarely seen today, the film is worth viewing for its flashback structure &ndash; comparable in some ways to Citizen Kane, which was influenced by the earlier film The Power and the Glory, for which Sturges wrote the screenplay &ndash; and for its irreverent and subtly satirical tone, unusual for a time when most Hollywood biopics were over-inflated and sentimental.

After the massacare of Piet Retief and his men by Dingaan on 6 February 1838, a number of Voortrekker camps were also attacked by the Zulu impis. These Voortrekkers appealed to other treks, particularly those of Piet Uys and Hendrik Potgieter in the Orange Free State, for help. Both treks send out commandos to help, including Uys' fifteen-year-old son, Dirkie. During the subsequent Battle of Italeni, Piet Uys was mortally wounded by an assegai while riding to the rescue of two of his cornered men. The rescue party failed. Opinions of what happened next differ: According to the most common version (mostly told by people who had not been present at the battle), Dirkie Uys was ahead of his father with most of the party when he heard his father ordering one of his men to leave him where he had fallen. Seeing the Zulus closing in on his father, Dirkie Uys turned around his horse, shouting \"I will die with my father\", and charged. He shot three Zulu warriors, briefly forcing them to retreat, but they rushed at him and stabbed him off his horse. Dirkie Uys fell beside his father, where they were both stabbed to death. This version of events is depicted on one of the historical friezes of the Voortrekker Monument. The version handed down by the Uys family as well as others that were present at the battle differs - according to them Dirkie Uys and another youngster were lagging behind the rest of the fleeing rescue party when they had to cross a stream with thick patches of reeds on its banks. While they were crossing it, a party of Zulus attacked them. The other youth escaped but Dirkie Uys's horse slipped, giving one of the Zulus an opportunity to grab his arm. Dirkie Uys was never seen alive again. After the Battle of Blood River, Piet Uys' remains were found by a detachment, but Dirkie Uys' never were. One account has it that the Zulus boiled his body into soup for ritual application.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Visitor, published in 1996 and written by K. A.

They consist of a steel pipe, an insulating layer, and an outer casing. The main purpose of such pipes is to maintain the temperature of the fluid in the pipes. A common application is the hot water from district heating plants. Most commonly used are single insulated pipes, but more recently in Europe it is becoming popular to use two pipes insulated within the same casing. By using insulated pipe supports, direct heat transfer between pipes and their supports are prevented. The insulating material usually used is polyurethane foam or similar, with a coefficient of thermal conductivity k=0.033-0.024 W/mK (thermal conductivity). Outer casing is usually high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Production of preinsulated pipes for district heating in the European Union is regulated by the standard EN253. According to EN253:2003, pipes must be produced to work at constant temperature of 130 °C for 30 years, keeping thermal conductivity less than or equal to 0.033 W/mK. There are three insulation thickness levels. Insulated pipelines are usually assembled from pipes of 6 m, 12 m, or 16 m in length, laid in depth . Efficient working life of district heating pipelines networks is estimated at 25–30 years, after which they need to be replaced with new pipes.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Matochina Point (, ‘Vrah Matochina’ \\'vr&h 'ma-to-chi-na\\) is a peak rising to 750 m in the north extremity of Imeon Range on Smith Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica.

In general, cyclic salt deposits are lower at sites further inland and are most abundant along the shoreline, although this pattern varies depending on the given environmental conditions. Use of the term \"cyclic\" refers to the cycle in which the salt moves from sea to land and is then washed by rainwater back to the sea. The salt (and other solid matter) cannot evaporate as water does. Instead it leaves the ocean surface in fine droplets of drop impacts or bubble bursts. Wave-crests and other turbulence form foam. When drops splash or bubbles burst, fine droplets of solute are ejected from the water or bubble surface into the air.

Its foundations and use as a malt house and drinking tavern date back to 1381. The low-beamed front bar area was put in place sometime in the 17th century. It was originally called the Spotted Cow but the name was changed in 1842, likely as part of an effort to extinguish its reputation as a venue for illegal gambling activities. The pub is frequented primarily by university students (of both Oxford University and Oxford Brookes University). It is located at the end of a narrow winding alley, St Helens Passage (originally Hell's passage), between Holywell Street and New College Lane, near the Bridge of Sighs. Running along one side of the pub is one of the remaining sections of the old city wall. Due to the illegal activities of many of its original patrons, the Turf sprang up in an area just outside the city wall in order to escape the jurisdiction of the governing bodies of the local colleges. The Turf Tavern is also where former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke set a Guinness World Record for consuming a yard glass of ale in 11 seconds in 1963. Local legend also has it that former U.S. president Bill Clinton, while attending Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, infamously \"did not inhale\" during an evening of carousing at the pub. Additional celebrities and public figures who have dined or drank at the tavern include Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Tony Blair, CS Lewis, Stephen Hawking and Margaret Thatcher. It also served as a hangout for the cast and crew of the Harry Potter movies while the nearby colleges were used as locations throughout the filming of the series. It is also reportedly haunted by \"Old Rosie,\" the ghost of a young woman who allegedly drowned herself in a nearby moat after her lover failed to return from the English Civil War. The Turf is still a frequent gathering place for the Rhodes community in Oxford as the site of Turf Tuesday every week during term.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The New Times is a national English language newspaper in Rwanda.

Brominated haloalkanes were first used during World War II as fire extinguisher for aircraft and tanks. Bromochlorodifluoromethane was introduced as an effective gaseous fire suppression agent in the mid 1960s for use around highly valuable materials in places such as museums, mainframe rooms and telecommunication switching centers. They were also widely used in the maritime industries in the engine rooms of ships and also in the transport industry in vehicles. Its efficiency as a fire extinguishing agent has also led it to be the predominant choice of fire extinguishing agent on commercial aircraft and is typically found in cylindrical hand-held canisters. Its advantages as a fire extinguishing agent are that it has lower toxicity than chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and that since it is a covalently bonded compound, it does not form conductive ions, therefore being usable on electrical equipment.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Piano Concerto No. 5 in E major, Op. 73, by Ludwig van Beethoven, popularly known as the Emperor Concerto, was his last completed piano concerto.

The method uses rolling circle replication to amplify small fragments of genomic DNA into DNA nanoballs. Fluorescent probes bind to complementary DNA and the probes are then ligated to anchor sequences bound to known sequences on the DNA template. The base order is determined via the fluorescence of the ligated and bound probes.<ref name=pmid19892942> This DNA sequencing method allows large numbers of DNA nanoballs to be sequenced per run at lower reagent costs compared to other next generation sequencing platforms. However, a limitation of this method is that it generates only short sequences of DNA, which presents challenges to mapping its reads to a reference genome.

The official EAS is designed to enable the President of the United States to speak to the United States within 10 minutes. In addition to this requirement, EAS is also designed to alert the public of local weather emergencies such as tornadoes and flash floods (and in some cases severe thunderstorms depending on the severity of the storm). The most recent National EAS Test was performed on September 27, 2017 at 2:20 pm EDT (11:20 am PDT). EAS is jointly coordinated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS). The EAS regulations and standards are governed by the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau of the FCC. EAS has become part of Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS), a program of FEMA. EAS messages are transmitted via AM, FM, broadcast television, cable television and Land Mobile Radio Service, as well as VHF, UHF, and FiOS (wireline video providers). Digital television, satellite television, and digital cable providers, along with Sirius XM satellite radio, IBOC, DAB, smart phones and digital radio broadcasters, have been required to participate in the EAS since December 31, 2006. DirecTV, Dish Network, and all other DBS providers have been required to participate since May 31, 2007. In 2008, the FCC began work on another system for public alerting designed and targeted at smartphones, meant to support the EAS. The Commercial Mobile Alert System (now Wireless Emergency Alerts) made its debut in about early 2013 in select states for select events. While this system functions independently from the Emergency Alert System, it may broadcast identical information.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Calapooya Mountains are a mountain range in Lane and Douglas counties of southwestern Oregon in the United States.

For example, 12 is a practical number because all the numbers from 1 to 11 can be expressed as sums of its divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: as well as these divisors themselves, we have 5 = 3 + 2, 7 = 6 + 1, 8 = 6 + 2, 9 = 6 + 3, 10 = 6 + 3 + 1, and 11 = 6 + 3 + 2. The sequence of practical numbers begins Practical numbers were used by Fibonacci in his Liber Abaci (1202) in connection with the problem of representing rational numbers as Egyptian fractions. Fibonacci does not formally define practical numbers, but he gives a table of Egyptian fraction expansions for fractions with practical denominators. The name \"practical number\" is due to . He noted that \"the subdivisions of money, weights, and measures involve numbers like 4, 12, 16, 20 and 28 which are usually supposed to be so inconvenient as to deserve replacement by powers of 10.\" He rediscovered the number theoretical property of such numbers and was the first to attempt a classification of these numbers that was completed by and . This characterization makes it possible to determine whether a number is practical by examining its prime factorization. Every even perfect number and every power of two is also a practical number. Practical numbers have also been shown to be analogous with prime numbers in many of their properties.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Parliamentary elections were held in Austria on 6 March 1966.
