Stefania Chmielinska and other founding members worked against these restrictions and developed the Alliance into a national organization as well as a leader in the Polish and Polish-American communities. The Polish Women's Alliance has been actively involved in some of the most central events and causes in Polish-American life.

This album consists of many of the songs that the band wrote over a period of two years as it played numerous gigs in Southern California, Nevada and Arizona, and saw its regional following swell in numbers. After a gig supporting Skankin' Pickle, the band was encouraged by then-sax-player Mike \"Bruce Lee\" Park to start touring.

The caste had a population of 19,222 in 1901, which included 9,672 males and 9,550 females. They are an upper caste of cement–makers and lime burners who once seem to have been Marathas, but they also seem to have formed themselves into a separate class by adopting the occupation of lime and charcoal burners. In Belgaum district they are divided into Mith (salt) and Chuna (lime) Lonaris, who eat together but do not intermarry. In Ahmednagar, Poona, and Sholapur district, they are divided into Lonari proper and Kadu, Akaramashe, who eat together but do not intermarry. In the Jativivek, they are described as the progeny of a man of the mallat caste and of a woman of the avart caste. Their Sanskrit name is \"Saumik\" and their occupation appears at one time to have been that of preparing salt. It is mentioned in Vaidik Books that they are born of \"Malla\" Purush and \"Avartak\" Stri (woman). They have their origin with Baliraja and other indigenous origin of Indian society. They have a deep connections with Dravidian culture and social history as they are migrated from south India to Middle India in state of Maharashtra. In the Mulstambha they are described as Kshatriyas, possibly on account of their Maratha origin. The Lonaris of Poona district relate that they came into the district from Mandesh near Phaltan in Satara district. They say that they were once Lingayats, when their religious ceremonies were conducted by Jangams. There is little evidence of their former connection with Lingayatism. A mention of the caste name occurs in the Mahabharata, when Dhritirashtra is advised by Vidur to act like a Mali who grows trees and eats fruits, instead of like a Lonari who burns trees and prepares charcoal (Note: There is no evidence of the existence of Lonari caste during earlier periods, as Lonaris are known to have separated from their original Maratha caste just a few centuries back). This indicates charcoal burning as in the Bombay Gazetteer, the Lonaris are Marathas and eat and marry with them. Evidence of such intermarriages is not forthcoming. In Sholapur district, when a child is born and about a year old, a Dhangar cuts the hair, and is presented with copper coins, five pieces of dry cocoa-kernel and betel packets, for this trouble. Lonaris have a caste-council, and their social disputes are settled at meetings of the caste-men. The commonest surnames among them are: Jarhad, Iparkar, Dhage, Dhumal, Lagad, Gite, Unde, More, Limgire, Chorge, Dhone, Dhangekar, Rakshe, Limite, Milke, Bondre, Karche, Tambe, Zadge, Kolarkar, Holkar, Kanade, Karande, Ingale, Dhokrat, Atpalkar, Milke, Ganganmale, Gudale, Awate, Gherade and Mutekar etc.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Grape soft drinks (also known as grape drink, grape soda or grape pop in certain regions of the US) are typically sweetened carbonated drinks with a grape flavor.

At long, the Boulevard Bridge was completed in 1925. It was privately owned and financed by the Boulevard Bridge Corporation for the purpose of providing access to the new Westover Hills neighborhood in South Richmond, where one of the selling points of the homes was free bridge access. It is named for The Boulevard, a main route through Richmond that ends just north of the bridge in Byrd Park. For many years, 5-cent tolls were collected at a toll booth midway on the span, and it became widely known as the \"Nickel Bridge\". Some years later, tolls were increased to 10 cents, and the nickname became the \"Dime Bridge\". However, despite all subsequent toll increases, it is still known today as the \"nickel bridge\" to many locals. Initially, the early toll-barrier was located in the middle of the span (actually above the north shore of the river between the canal and the north end), because all the property on either side except the right-of-way for the roadway itself was owned by others, and the toll barrier at that location could be erected at no additional land acquisition expense. It was certainly not possible to circumvent paying the toll at that location. The toll booths were relocated to a plaza north of the bridge in the mid-1960s. During the years of ownership by the Boulevard Bridge Corporation, Westover Hills residents were given free access across the bridge by the use of a special license plate that was attached below the state plates on their cars. These plates had to be applied for and were also sold to the general public. They were changed each year, and in the last years before Richmond Metropolitan Authority (RMA) control, windshield stickers were used. On November 24, 1969, the RMA, which was building Richmond's new expressway system at the time, purchased the Boulevard Bridge for $1.2 million. The toll on the bridge was kept at 10 cents until 1988, when it was doubled to 20 cents. In August 1992, the RMA closed the bridge for 18 months to complete extensive renovation work, which included widening the existing lanes, installing new toll booths and equipment on the north end of the bridge, and improving safe access for bicycles and pedestrians. The bridge reopened in October 1993. The toll was increased again in 1998 to 25 cents. In 2008, the RMA increased the tolls on all of its roads, bringing the Boulevard Bridge to its current rate of 35 cents. Despite the renovation work in the early 1990s, weight restrictions on the bridge limit vehicles to under 7,500 lbs.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Ashish Patel (born July 31, 1975, in Quebec) is a Canadian cricketer.

They have been hailed by the Boston Phoenix as \"one of Boston's most prized pop possessions\", received a 3 1/2 star review for their debut in Rolling Stone Magazine, and have been praised by Pitchfork Media as having \"vivid lyrics,\" and a \"knack for crafting fist-pumping anthems.\" The band was signed to Misra Records in 2006 on which they released their first two full-length albums. They have co-written a song with Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, collaborated with author Jonathan Lethem, and have had a live performance interrupted by Chevy Chase. In 2009, the band helped arrange and record the Titus Andronicus album The Monitor. All trumpet, cello, keyboards, and piano parts for the album were recorded with Hallelujah the Hills in Boston in August 2009, including backing vocals on \"A More Perfect Union\" and \"Titus Andronicus Forever\". After the album's release, the two bands toured together with Hallelujah the Hills opening, and then joining Titus Andronicus halfway through their set to form a large band that recreated the album's arrangements. During the Titus Andronicus after-party show for 2010's Pitchfork Festival, Hallelujah the Hills singer Ryan Walsh took on Jenn Wasner's vocal part to perform the Titus duet \"To Old Friends And New\". Pitchfork wrote that the band's sophomore album, Colonial Drones, found the band jumping \"to the accelerated class\" while Blurt Magazine called it \"a rough-hewn classic.\" In support of the release, the band toured with The Silver Jews which led to the collaboration on the song \"Classic Tapes\" in which Jews' bassist Cassie Berman sings with Hills singer Ryan Walsh. After their third drummer Peter Negroponte quit on-stage during a live concert, the band began working with longtime Son Volt drummer Dave Bryson on new songs. During this time, Misra Records changed ownership, and the band's contract was not renewed. Hallelujah The Hills' third full-length album No One Knows What Happens Next was funded by a successful Kickstarter project and was declared \"a daring move\" by Prefix Magazine for its stripped down arrangements and lack of distortion. It was called a \"gorgeous start-to-finish listen\" by Dig Boston. Shortly after recording sessions for No One Knows What Happens Next ended, Walsh wrote a large feature for The Boston Phoenix in which he admitted to being the ringleader behind the 2008 file-sharing hoax, \"The Overdub Tampering Committee\" Later that year, he created a crowd-sourced collage song involving hundreds of contributors and directed a video for Marissa Nadler's song \"The Wrecking Ball Company.\"\" The band also performed at the site of the Boston Occupy movement around this time, later learning they were surveilled by BRIC (Boston Regional Intelligence Center) for the performance. In May 2013, the band released a collection of b-sides, non-album tracks, and rarities entitled Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Trashcan. In a Boston Herald profile published around that same time, the band was singled out for their recent turn of writing about writing, posing the question \"It takes genius to write a great song about writing a song. So how is it Hallelujah The Hills has done it twice in two years?\" Recorded at 1809 Studios in Macedon, New York, the band finished the fourth album in five days in early 2014. In a blog entry posted during the sessions, Walsh hinted that the album had some connection to The Fox Sisters who are regularly credited as being the accidental inventors of the Spiritualist movement in America in the late 1800s. Have You Ever Done Something Evil? was released on May 13, 2014. The album was a critical success, earning the band high praise from SPIN, Stereogum, Noisey, Blurt Magazine and more. Popmatters declared the album the \"#1 Overlooked Album of the Year,\" calling it the band's \"masterstroke.\" Evil's first single \"Pick Up An Old Phone\" was subsequently BBC Radio6's song of the day in April 2014. The band won two Boston Music Awards for Evil including Best Rock Act and Best Video. Following the album's release, the band toured California performing a week of live dates and an appearance on the Improv4Humans podcast, wherein comedians Matt Besser, Lauren Lapkus, and others created comedic scenes based on live performances of the band's songs. This podcast recording happened just hours after the band was robbed in Oakland, California where all of the band's personal items and merchandise was stolen while they were on stage at The New Parish. Upon their return to the east coast, the band created two additional music videos— one based on an improvised scene with comedian James Adomian (Comedy Bang Bang, Last Comic Standing), and another where the band staged a house party and filmed the results. Taking part in a live-streamed event called \"Behind The Album,\" songwriter Ryan Walsh likened the odds of their fourth album coming together the way it did to \"pulling off a heist.\" On April 12 2016, Hallelujah The Hills returned with A Band Is Something To Figure Out, their fifth full-length album, recorded almost ten years to the day of their first rehearsal.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"TM Asia Life is a general and life insurance company.

Having been composed by Mann and Weil, the song was a rare example of a Parton hit that she did not write herself. The songwriting duo originally composed \"Here You Come Again\" in 1975 as a potential comeback hit for Brenda Lee, but when Lee decided not to record it, the song made its way to Parton, who was in the process of redirecting her career as a successful mainstream country artist, to that of an entertainer with broader pop appeal, and was looking for a vehicle to assist with that transition. Her producer Gary Klein had heard the song on the then-recently released B.J. Thomas's self-titled album. Even so, Klein told Tom Roland in The Billboard Book of Number One County Hits that she begged him to add a steel guitar to avoid sounding too pop, and he called in Al Perkins to fill that role. \"She wanted people to be able to hear the steel guitar, so if someone said it isn't country, she could say it and prove it,\" Klein told Roland. \"She was so relieved. It was like her life sentence was reprieved.\" \"Here You Come Again\" was released as a single in September 1977 as the title track from Parton's album Here You Come Again, and was the centerpiece of her now famous pop crossover move in the late 1970s.

This appendage ranges from 3-10 nanometers in diameter and can be up to several micrometers long. Fimbriae are used by bacteria to adhere to one another and to adhere to animal cells and some inanimate objects. A bacterium can have as many as 1,000 fimbriae. Fimbriae are only visible with the use of an electron microscope. They may be straight or flexible. Fimbriae carry adhesins which attach them to the substratum so that the bacteria can withstand shear forces and obtain nutrients. For example, E. coli uses them to attach to mannose receptors. Some aerobic bacteria form a very thin layer at the surface of a broth culture. This layer, called a, consists of many aerobic bacteria that adhere to the surface by their fimbriae. Thus, fimbriae allow the aerobic bacteria to remain on the broth, from which they take nutrients, while they congregate near the air. \"Gram-negative bacteria assemble functional amyloid surface fibers called curli.\" Curli are a type of fimbriae; another type are called type I fimbriae. Curli are composed of proteins called curlins. Some of the genes involved are CsgA, CsgB, CsgC, CsgD, CsgE, CsgF, and CsgG.

This process of adhering bacterial cells to a host cell, can lead to the colonization of that host cell as more and more bacterial cell collect around them, and is integral to the continued survival of the bacteria as it goes on to infect tissues and entire organs.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"is a Japanese computer scientist and one of the world's foremost researchers in computer vision.

As a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, he represented South Longford from 1888 to 1892. He was a strong supporter of Charles Stewart Parnell. Fitzgerald was born in 1850 in County Limerick to Maurice Fitzgerald and Maria Teresa Gubbins. He was baptised on 26 December 1850 in Kilfinane. His grand nephew was Irish hurler Tommy McCarthy (hurler) . Fitzgerald trained at the Meath Hospital and Mercer’s Hospital, Dublin. He won a prize certificate for surgery in 1872. Thereafter he moved to England where he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1876 and was an assistant surgeon at the Edmonton Infirmary. He became a Licenciate of the Apothecaries’ Hall, Dublin in 1877 and a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons at Edinburgh in 1884. He lived the rest of his life in South London, at Brixton, Balham, Norbury and finally from 1919 at Beddington. He was elected unopposed to represent South Longford at a by-election on 30 June 1888, filling the vacancy created by the resignation of Laurence Connolly. When the Irish Parliamentary Party split in December 1890 over Parnell’s leadership, Fitzgerald was one of the inner circle of Parnell’s supporters. He was one of the small group to be read Parnell’s manifesto in reply to Gladstone on 28 November 1890 before its publication, and took part with Parnell and other Parnellite MPs in the repossession by force of the newspaper United Ireland on 11 December 1890. He was active in the by-election campaigns which took place between then and Parnell’s death in October 1891. He was one of the few people to see the dead Parnell at Brighton. Fitzgerald did not contest the general election in 1892. At the general election in 1895 he attempted to dislodge the sitting Anti-Parnellite MP, Daniel Ambrose – also a doctor – at South Louth, but was defeated by almost 2 to 1. However, by 1897 Fitzgerald had become alienated from his Parnellite colleagues and their leader John Redmond. In a letter printed in the Freeman's Journal on 5 March 1897 he referred to 'the hollow sham of Redmondism' and wrote 'any Parnellites or Nationalists in the country who still believe that Parnellism and Redmondism are, or ever have been, one and the same thing, will now be undeceived'. In 1910 Fitzgerald was provisional chairman of the Central London branch of William O'Brien’s All-for-Ireland League, which was opposed to the reunited Irish Parliamentary Party led by John Redmond. Fitzgerald was commissioned as a Captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps at some time prior to 1921. In that year he joined the London Committee of the Irish Cancer Research Fund. His death on 7 May 1926 at the age of 73 was apparently unmarked by any obituary.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Quintana Redonda is a municipality located in the province of Soria, Castile and León, Spain.

It is considered a classic of the musical genre of garage rock, and became the group's only national hit. The song has since been featured on several compilation albums. The Choir originally came to prominence in Cleveland under the moniker the Mods, covering a wide variety of material penned by British Invasion-based groups such as the Who, the Rolling Stones, and the Beatles. As the house band for the Painesville Armory, the group appeared on several local television programs, emulating a pop sound inspired by the songs they covered. By 1966, the band members developed into capable songwriters, writing the originals \"It's Cold Outside\" and \"Going Home\". With their freshly-penned material in hand, the Mods traveled to Chicago to record. Around the same time, the band changed their name to the Choir because the Modernaires were recording under the name \"the Mods.\" The song's lyrics pertain to a dejected recounting of a failed love affair, though the vocal delivery is conducted in a sunny manner. Klawon explains \"I used to write quite a bit then, and one day I was thinking of some sort of theme to use with the moon/spoon, boy/girl lyrics,\" before deciding \"to go with a weather analogy\". Also evident are the soothing vocal harmonies and fast-paced rhythm guitar instrumentals, both reminiscent of early Beatles and Who compositions. In addition to the British Invasion-influenced arrangements, \"It's Cold Outside\" is also marked by Dave Burke's raving bass playing and lead guitarist Wally Bryson's jangling Byrds-esque technique. Music historian Richie Unterberger, writing for the Allmusic website, proposes the tune would have been better suited for \"the innocent times of 1964 than for the complicated culture and music scene of 1967\". Upon its release in September 1966, \"It's Cold Outside\" drew little attention. However, in April 1967 the single was re-issued on Roulette Records and went to No. 1 on all three Top 40 radio stations in Cleveland, retaining the position for five weeks. Nationally, the record peaked at No. 49 in Record World, No. 55 in Cash Box and No. 68 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"It's Cold Outside\" gained more attention from garage rock enthusiasts years later when it was compiled on Pebbles, Volume 2 and the 1998 reissue of .

Nursing diagnoses foster the nurse's independent practice (e.g., patient comfort or relief) compared to dependent interventions driven by physician's orders (e.g., medication administration). Nursing diagnoses are developed based on data obtained during the nursing assessment. An actual nursing diagnosis presents a problem response present at time of assessment. Whereas a medical diagnosis identifies a disorder, a nursing diagnosis identifies problems that result from that disorder. The nursing diagnostic process is unique among others. A nursing diagnosis integrates patient involvement, when possible, throughout the process. The North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) is body of professionals that manage an official list of nursing diagnosis. All nurses must be familiar with the steps of the nursing process in order to gain the most efficiency from their positions. In order to select the correct nursing diagnosis, the nurse must make quick and accurate conclusions from patient data during assessment.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Stream gradient is the grade measured by the ratio of drop in elevation of a stream per unit horizontal distance, usually expressed as metres per kilometre or feet per mile.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Groninger Museum () is an art museum in the city of Groningen in the Netherlands.
