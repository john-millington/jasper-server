Duell attended the University of Southern California School of Architecture and graduated in 1925. Joining the Los Angeles architectural firm Webber, Staunton and Spaulding, Duell contributed to designs for notable building projects in metropolitan Los Angeles during the 1920s and 1930s, among them the Avalon Casino on Catalina Island, Frary Dining Hall and adjacent residence halls at Pomona College, and Greenacres, the estate of silent movie actor Harold Lloyd in Beverly Hills. He and architect Sumner Spaulding collaborated in the design of the Atkinson residence in Bel Air, which was modeled after the Petit Trianon at Versailes. As construction declined during the Great Depression, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer hired Duell in 1936 to design the set of the Capulet home in Irving Thalberg's production of Romeo and Juliet. In 1937, he joined the MGM art department in a full-time capacity. During his career as a motion picture art director, he was nominated for three Academy Awards in the category Best Art Direction. He received screen credit for his work on 38 films, among them Ninotchka (1939), The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), Intruder in the Dust (1949), and ''Singin' in the Rain'' (1952). Additionally he worked on a number of motion pictures without film credit, among them The Wizard of Oz, 1939. He retired from MGM in 1959. During much of his career at MGM, Duell maintained an outside architectural practice and designed residential and commercial buildings in Southern California. Notable among his designs during this period is Casa de Cadillac, a car dealership in Sherman Oaks built in 1948 which is now considered a prime example of Googie architecture. Following his departure from MGM in 1959, he joined Marco Engineering and collaborated with C. V. Wood and Wade Rubottom in the design of Freedomland USA in the Bronx, the first of many theme parks he would design. The following year, he left Marco Engineering and established R. Duell and Associates, a Santa Monica-based architectural practice which specialized in the design of theme parks. Marrying traditional architecture with stagecraft, the firm designed most of the country's theme parks. The list of projects included Six Flags Over Texas, Arlington, TX; Marriott's Great America parks in Gurnee, IL (now Six Flags Great America), and Santa Clara, CA (now California's Great America); the Universal Studios Tour, Universal City, CA; the Texas Pavilion at the 1964 World's Fair in New York ; Six Flags Magic Mountain, Valencia, CA; Opryland, Nashville, TN; Six Flags AstroWorld, Houston, TX; Hersheypark Hershey, PA; Carowinds, Charlotte, NC; Kings Island, Mason, OH; Kings Dominion, Doswell, VA; and others.

The film premiered in Los Angeles on February 7, 1985. Universal Pictures released the film in cinemas in the United States on February 15, 1985. It received critical acclaim and earned $51.5 million on a $1 million budget. Critics consider it one of the greatest high school films of all time, as well as one of Hughes' most memorable and recognizable works. The media referred to the film's five main actors as members of a group called the \"Brat Pack.\" The title comes from the nickname invented by students and staff for morning detention at New Trier High School, the school attended by the son of one of John Hughes' friends. Thus, those who were sent to detention before school starting time were designated members of \"The Breakfast Club.\" In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" The film was digitally remastered and was re-screened throughout 430 theaters in celebration of its 30th anniversary in 2015.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Frederick George Topham, VC (August 10, 1917 &ndash; May 31, 1974) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Tomislavgrad (), also known by its former name Duvno (), is a town and municipality in western Bosnia and Herzegovina and also seat of the Assembly of Canton 10 of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"A mesoporous material is a material containing s with diameters between 2 and 50 nm, according to IUPAC nomenclature. For comparison, IUPAC defines microporous material as a material having pores smaller than 2 nm in diameter and macroporous material as a material having pores larger than 50 nm in diameter. Typical mesoporous materials include some kinds of silica and alumina that have similarly-sized mesopores. Mesoporous oxides of niobium, tantalum, titanium, zirconium, cerium and tin have also been reported. However, the flagship of mesoporous materials is mesoporous carbon, which has direct applications in energy storage devices. Mesoporous carbon has porosity within the mesopore range and this significantly increases the specific surface area. An other very common mesoporous material is Activated Carbon which is typically composed of a carbon framework with both mesoporosity and microporosity depending on the conditions under which it was synthesized. According to IUPAC, a mesoporous material can be disordered or ordered in a mesostructure. In crystalline ionorganic materials, mesoporous structure noticeably limits the number of lattice units, and this significantly changes the solid-state chemistry. For example, the battery performance of mesoporous electroactive materials is significantly different from that of their bulk structure. A procedure for producing mesoporous materials (silica) was patented around 1970,  and methods based on the Stöber process from 1968 were still in use in 2015. It went almost unnoticed and was reproduced in 1997. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were independently synthesized in 1990 by researchers in Japan. They were later produced also at Mobil Corporation laboratories and named Mobil Crystalline Materials, or MCM-41. Since then, research in this field has steadily grown. Notable examples of prospective applications are catalysis, sorption, gas sensing, ion exchange, optics, and photovoltaics. It should be taken into account that this mesoporosity refers to the classification of nanoscale porosity, and mesopores may be defined differently in other contexts; for example, mesopores are defined as cavities with sizes in the range 30 μm–75 μm in the context of porous aggregations such as soil.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Ray Cummings (byname of Raymond King Cummings) (August 30, 1887 – January 23, 1957) was an American author of science fiction literature and comic books.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"'Steam Tug Wattle' is a steam-powered tugboat undergoing refurbishment in Melbourne, Australia. The tugboat was constructed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard during the Great Depression as a project to keep shipyard apprentices employed. The tugboat was built with a riveted steel hull, but welding was used on the bulkheads and fuel bunkers for the first time in an Australian shipyard. The vessel was the first Australian tugboat to be built with an oil-fired compound steam engine. On completion in 1933, the tugboat was offered to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Named Wattle and operated by a civilian crew, the vessel was primarily used for warship towing and manoeuvring, and was also employed as a target tower. The RAN marked the tugboat for disposal in 1969, and she was purchased by a Sydney-based syndicate, who operated the vessel on tourist cruises around and outside Sydney Harbour. The syndicate kept Wattle operational until 1977, then sold the ship to a Melbourne-based company, who towed Wattle to Port Phillip in 1979. The tugboat continued to be used for tourist cruises around the bay until 2003, when it failed survey and had to be withdrawn from service. Wattle was initially moored at Victoria Dock while money was raised to refurbish the ship, then was relocated to Victoria Harbour during the Docklands redevelopment. In 2007, the Sorrento Steam organisation and the Bay Steamers Maritime Museum joined the project: the former using the restoration of Wattle as a stepping stone towards their own plans to restore steam trams in Sorrento. In 2009, the tugboat was removed from the water and placed on blocks in a temporary shipyard in the Docklands precinct. The intention is to bring the vessel back to survey standard and resume passenger operations. Wattle was listed by the National Trust as being of national historic significance on 16 June 1993. According to the National Trust, Wattle is the only surviving small harbour steam tug in Australia, and one of only twenty-two worldwide. It is also one of only eight Australian-built steam-powered ships of any kind remaining. In addition to multiple 'firsts' in construction, the vessel serves as an important example of Depression-era shipbuilding and the transition of technology occurring at this time.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Sequentia is an early music ensemble, founded in 1977 by Benjamin Bagby and Barbara Thornton (died 8 November 1998).

This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-(sn-glycero-3-phospho)-1D-myo-inositol inositolphosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include 1,2-cyclic-inositol-phosphate phosphodiesterase, D-myo-inositol 1:2-cyclic phosphate 2-phosphohydrolase, D-inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate 2-phosphohydrolase, D-myo-inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate 2-phosphohydrolase, 1-D-myo-inositol-1,2-cyclic-phosphate 2-inositolphosphohydrolase, and inositol-1,2-cyclic-phosphate 2-inositolphosphohydrolase.

The word is closely related to the Arabic word mukhannath ( \"androgynous\"), a Classical Arabic term referring to individuals with an androgynous nature. John Money summarizes material presented by Unni Wikan in an article titled Man becomes woman: Transsexualism in Oman as a key to gender roles. According to this account, the mukhannath is the \"bottom\" in a male same-sex relationship. Because of this, khanith are considered men by Omani standards and are often considered an \"alternative gender role\" – and sometimes considered as being transgender or transvestites – even though the khanith are still referred to by masculine names and are treated as male by the law. Because of this confusion in terminology, many people refer to the khanith as khanith alone. The khanith are considered a specific third gender category in the Arabian Peninsula.

He soon found out that he intended to use the fresh theoretical framework of quantum physics in space, and investigate the applications of quantum mechanics in stars. Obviously, questions of nepotism were in play when he applied for an assistantship already in 1925, which he didn't get. But only one year later it was given to him anyway &mdash; he was the best, regardless of his employer being also his own father. After being appointed as lecturer at the university in 1932, Strömgren was invited to the University of Chicago in 1936 by Otto Struve. Going abroad for 18 months meant a lot to the young researcher, and when he went back to Denmark and to the rising national socialism in Europe, he succeeded his father's professorship in 1940. During five years of isolation, under the German occupation of Denmark, he initiated the building of a new Danish Observatory, the Brorfelde Observatory. But after the Second World War, Bengt Strömgren became tired of lacking state funding for the project, and with a stagnant national economy, he felt that he had to leave Danish research, which he did in 1951. He went to the United States and became director of the Yerkes and McDonald Observatories, and stayed there for six years. In 1957, he was appointed the first professor of theoretical astrophysics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he got Albert Einstein's office. He stayed at Princeton with his family until 1967, when he went back to his homeland Denmark, and became the next to the last resident in a series of great Danish scientists of the Carlsberg Mansion and Honor, which had earlier been occupied by Niels Bohr among others. In 1987, he died after a short period of illness. Bengt Strömgren made momentous contributions to astrophysics. He found that the chemical composition of stars was very much different than previously assumed. In the late 1930s, he found the relative abundance of hydrogen to be nearly 70%, and helium to be about 27%. Just before the war, he discovered the so-called Strömgren Spheres &mdash; huge interstellar shells of ionized hydrogen around stars. And in the 1950s and 1960s, he pioneered photoelectric photometry with a novel four-color system, now called Strömgren photometric system. Apart from the Danish observatory of Brorfelde, Strömgren was active in the early organisation of the joint European observatory of ESO in La Silla.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The term Holy Guardian Angel (HGA) originates in the Catholic Church where a morning prayer is recited which reads, \"Holy Guardian Angel whom God has appointed to be my guardian,direct and govern me during this day/ Amen\". The idea of a Holy Guardian Angel is central to the book, \"The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra Melin the Mage\", Abraham of Worms, a German Cabalist who wrote the book on ceremonial magick during the 15th century which was later translated by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, the founder of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. He elaborated on this earlier work, giving it extensive magical notes, but the original concept goes back to the Zoroastrian Arda Fravaš ('Holy Guardian Angels'). In Mathers' publication of The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, he writes: :\"If thou shalt perfectly observe these rules, all the following Symbols and an infinitude of others will be granted unto thee by thy Holy Guardian Angel; thou thus living for the Honour and Glory of the True and only God, for thine own good, and that of thy neighbour.

Chordates are deuterostomes, as during the embryo development stage the anus forms before the mouth. They are also bilaterally symmetric coelomates with metameric segmentation and a circulatory system. In the case of vertebrate chordates, the notochord is usually replaced by a vertebral column during development. Taxonomically, the phylum includes the following subphyla: the Vertebrata, which includes fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals; the Tunicata, which includes salps and sea squirts; and the Cephalochordata, which include the lancelets. There are also additional extinct taxa such as the Vetulicolia. The Vertebrata are sometimes considered as a subgroup of the clade Craniata, consisting of chordates with a skull; the Craniata and Tunicata compose the clade Olfactores. Of the more than 65,000 living species of chordates, about half are bony fish of the superclass Osteichthyes. The world's largest and fastest animals, the blue whale and peregrine falcon respectively, are chordates, as are humans. Fossil chordates are known from at least as early as the Cambrian explosion. Hemichordata, which includes the acorn worms, has been presented as a fourth chordate subphylum, but it now is usually treated as a separate phylum. The Hemichordata, along with the Echinodermata (which includes starfish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and crinoids), form the Ambulacraria, the sister taxon of the Chordates.

The ancient Saint David's River once flowed through this area prior to the advance of the Wisconsin Glacier during the last glacial period. When the glacier retreated 12,000 years ago, the gorge and river valley were filled in with glacial silt and rocks. Approximately 4,200 years ago, the Niagara River intersected the buried gorge in the course of Niagara Falls receding toward Lake Erie. When the river encountered the soft glacial silt that filled the gorge, the river rapidly changed course to fill the ancient gorge and wash out most of the silt. This led to the formation of the Niagara Whirlpool. The Niagara River reclaimed the gorge and currently flows through part of the ancient gorge. The other part of the ancient gorge extends into Lake Ontario at a different point than the Niagara River. The gorge is estimated to be long,  wide, and  deep. In the 1950s Ontario Hydro dug two tunnels from the upper Niagara River, to supply water to the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Plant. These tunnels had to surface when they encountered the St. David's Gorge, as the loose silt in it was unsuitable for tunneling. In 2013 an additional tunnel, the Niagara Tunnel Project, was completed. This tunnel was bored beneath the old gorge to avoid the unsuitable geology.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Khederabad or Khedrabad () may refer to:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Vargön is an island in the northwest of the Swedish sector of the Bay of Bothnia, in the Piteå archipelago.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Abgarm (, also Romanized as Ābgarm; also known as Ābgarm-e Karvan) is a village in Karvan-e Sofla Rural District, Karvan District, Tiran and Karvan County, Isfahan Province, Iran.

The modern term describes vessels covered with a shiny black slip. Black-glazed pottery was produced especially in the Classical and Hellenistic periods. During reduced firing, sintering of the iron-rich clay led to a shiny black surface. Such pottery was produced both on the potter's wheel or impressed in pre-shaped matrixes. The glaze was added on with a paintbrush on the wheel, or by dipping. In some cases, black-glazed ware was additionally decorated with white, red or gold paint. Plastic decoration, either applied by stamp, or as applied reliefs, also occurred. Within about a hundred years, during the 5th century BC, black-glazed wares replaced the previously popular red-figure pottery from the Mediterranean markets. Since the Hellenistic periods, non-Greek workshops also produced it, usually just serving local or regional markets. In recent years, the importance of the type in modern research has increased considerably, especially in the contexts of culinary habits, regional contacts and trade links.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Government of the Republic of South Africa and Others v Grootboom and Others is an important case in South African law, heard in the Constitutional Court on 11 May 2000, with judgment handed down on 4 October.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Robbie Willmott (born 16 May 1990) is an English footballer who plays as a winger for Newport County.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Kabikankan Mukundaram Mahavidyalaya, is the general degree college in Keshabpur, Hooghly district.

Multiple instance learning (MIL) falls under the supervised learning framework, where every training instance has a label, either discrete or real valued. MIL deals with problems with incomplete knowledge of labels in training sets. More precisely, in multiple-instance learning, the training set consists of labeled “bags”, each of which is a collection of unlabeled instances. A bag is positively labeled if at least one instance in it is positive, and is negatively labeled if all instances in it are negative. The goal of the MIL is to predict the labels of new, unseen bags. Convenient and simple example for MIL was given in. Imagine several people, and each of them has a key chain that contains few keys. Some of these people are able to enter a certain room, and some aren’t. The task is then to predict whether a certain key or a certain key chain can get you into that room. To solve this problem we need to find the exact key that is common for all the “positive” key chains.

Better dickeys have a trouser tab at the end to secure them down, preventing the dickey from popping out. The rigid plastic dickey came into fashion in the latter years of the 19th century, and was one of the first successful commercial applications of celluloid. The invention of the dickey was to make the bosom front of a full dress shirt a separate entity in itself, like the detachable collar, so it could be laundered and starched more easily than a traditional shirt with the bosom attached. The use of the dickey was considered bad style by traditionalists and had fallen out of use. Shirts with an attached bosom are now rare in themselves since traditional evening dress is no longer regularly worn. The etymology can be attributed to Cockney rhyming slang where a \"dicky dirt\" is a shirt. Additionally, British office workers were required to wear suits, but their wages made it difficult to keep a fresh supply of laundered shirts. It was common practice, especially by the 1850s, to use dickeys as a way of covering dirty shirts.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Westenschouwen is a village in the Dutch province of Zeeland.

Two of his designs, the Thistle and the Flying Scot, are among the most popular one design racing classes in the United States. The Flying Scot was inducted into the American Sailboat Hall of Fame. As a small boat racer, Douglass was five times the North American champion in the 10 Square Meter International Sailing Canoe, five times the United States national champion in the Thistle, and seven times the Flying Scot North American champion. Douglass was born in 1904, in Newark, New Jersey. His father, George P. Douglass, was a real estate manager who became manager of The Dakota, a famous apartment building in New York City, moving the family there in 1920. George P. Douglass was a champion sailing canoe racer, and Sandy Douglass learned to sail by being on sailboats from his infancy. His family vacationed in the Thousand Islands region of the Saint Lawrence River, eventually buying a small island there. Douglass went to prep school at Collegiate School in New York City, then to Dartmouth College, graduating in 1926. His athletic pursuits included college gymnastics, canoe paddling, ice boating, and sailing canoe racing. He qualified for the Canadian national canoe paddling team, but was not allowed to go to the 1936 Olympics because he was American. Douglass befriended the famous English boat designer and racer Uffa Fox, whom he met through sailing canoe racing. After false starts at selling Buicks and painting portraits, Douglass took up boat building in 1938. At several shops in Ohio, Douglass built sailing canoes, International 14's, Interlakes, and Stars. After a wartime job as a lofter for a shipbuilding company, Douglass designed the Thistle in 1945. (These boat names commemorate Douglass’s Scots heritage.) Influenced by Uffa Fox's International 14 design, and built using the innovative molded plywood technique, the Thistle quickly caught on with dinghy racers. It was light, fast, and held to strict one design standards by the Thistle Class Association founded by Douglass. In 1949, Douglass designed the Highlander, a racing dinghy that is still popular, mainly in the south and midwest. Douglass raced his boats constantly for his own enjoyment and as part of his relentless promotion of his designs and dinghy sailing in general. Douglass's involvement with the Thistle and the Highlander ended in 1956 when he split with Ray McLeod, his business partner. Douglass then designed the Flying Scot for construction in the then-new technique of glass-reinforced polyester. Larger and more stable than the Thistle, the Flying Scot also became popular. Its wide beam and the prohibition of hiking straps were an effort to make the boat more competitive for smaller-sized people like Douglass and his wife, Mary (1907–2005), who crewed for him for 30 years. Douglass moved his business to Oakland, Maryland, in 1958. Douglass retired in 1971 and sold the company. The successor company, Flying Scot, Inc., still builds Flying Scots in Oakland. Douglas died in 1992. He and Mary had one son, Alan. Douglass's gregariousness, optimism, and unflagging self-confidence is evident throughout his 1986 autobiography, \"Sixty Years Behind the Mast:: The Fox on the Water.\" Among his hobbies was barbershop singing.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Badi' ud-Din Shah bin Ihsanullah bin Rashidullah Shah bin Rashid ud-Din Shah bin Muhammad Yasin Shah bin Muhammad Rashid Shah ar-Rashidi al-Hussaini (10 July 1925– 8 January 1996), commonly known as '''Badi' ud-Din Shah al-Rashidi''' was a Muslim scholar, writer and book collector.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"is a terminal railway station on the Kintetsu Utsube Line in Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture, Japan, operated by the private railway operator Kintetsu.

He had previously represented Sandwich in the House of Commons and served as Under-Secretary of State for Home Affairs and Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. Lord Brabourne had assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Hugessen (which was that of his maternal grandmother) in 1849. His son, the second Baron, represented Rochester in Parliament as a Liberal. In 1917 his younger brother, the fourth Baron, who had succeeded his nephew the third Baron in 1915, inherited the Baronetcy of Mersham Hatch. Since then the titles have remained merged. The fourth Baron was succeeded by his son, the fifth Baron. He was Conservative Member of Parliament for Ashford, Governor of Bombay and Governor of Bengal. In 1919 Lord Brabourne assumed by deed poll the surname of Knatchbull only. His eldest son, the sixth Baron, was killed in the Second World War, when the title passed to the latter's younger brother, the seventh Baron. He was a film and television producer. In 1946 he married The Honourable Patricia Mountbatten, daughter of the naval commander Viscount Mountbatten (later the 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma). Their son, the eighth baron, who succeeded in 2005, is also the Earl Mountbatten of Burma. This means that the barony of Brabourne is held jointly by the current and future Earls Mountbatten of Burma descended only from male lines of the 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma and her husband, the 7th Baron Brabourne. Should that male line become extinct, the titles will then separate or become extinct dependent on collateral male lines existing from previous holders of the titles. The Baronetcy, of Mersham Hatch in the County of Kent, was created in the Baronetage of England in 1641 for Norton Knatchbull, who represented Kent and New Romney in the House of Commons. His son, the second Baronet, also represented these constituencies in Parliament. His nephew, the fourth Baronet (who had succeeded his father, a younger brother of the second Baronet), sat as Member of Parliament for Rochester, Kent and Lostwithiel. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Baronet who served as High Sheriff of Kent in 1733. In 1746 he assumed by private act of the Parliament of Ireland the additional surname of Wyndham, pursuant to the will of his mother's father Thomas Wyndham, 1st Baron Wyndham. His son, the sixth Baronet, represented Kent in Parliament. On his death the title passed to his uncle, the seventh Baronet. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as representative for Armagh. His son, the eighth Baronet, was High Sheriff of Kent in 1785 and later represented Kent in the House of Commons. He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Baronet. He represented both Kent and East Kent in Parliament and notably served as Paymaster-General in the Tory administrations of Sir Robert Peel. His grandson, the twelfth Baronet, briefly represented East Kent in the House of Commons. On his death in 1917 he was succeeded by his first cousin the fourth Baron Brabourne, who became the thirteenth Baronet of Mersham Hatch as well. The 8th Baron Brabourne inherited the peerage of Earl Mountbatten of Burma, with the death of his mother Patricia Knatchbull, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma on 13 June 2017.

The Roeivierkamp has been organized by the Amsterdam Student Rowing Association Nereus since 1973 and is an official FISA competition. The matches are open for 'eights' (boats with eight rowers) and for 'double four with' (four rowers, each two belts, with mate / wife). It is a big event with (in 2013) around 3500 participants from various age categories and countries. All rowing clubs along the Amstel will open their grounds and club houses for visiting teams and a large team of volunteers will participate. There are four distances to row: 250 meters, 750 meters, 2500 meters and 5000 meters. The final score is determined by calculating the results back to a 250-meter time and adding to each other (comparable to the all-round classification in speed skating races). A team that is bad at a short distance, therefore, has to make up a lot on the long distance. On Saturday, the 2500 and 250 meters are rowed immediately after each other, on Sunday the teams row the 750 meters in the morning and the 5000 meters in the afternoon. The start of the short distances is at the Nieuwe Amstel bridge (between Ceintuurbaan and Ruyschstraat), where two teams are rowing together in the direction of Ouderkerk. The start of the long distances is at the Rozenoordbrug (2500 m) and the Grote Bocht (5000 m) respectively, here the teams start shortly after each other in the direction of Amsterdam. The finish of all distances is for the clubhouse of Nereus at the Amsteldijk at the Berlagebrug in Amsterdam. The teams can be recognized by their clothing and the blades of the belts. National rowers wear their Dutch shirt under the club jersey, white with an orange band on the arm. Traditionally, the supporters cycle with their team on long distances and encourage them loudly with special slogans. It is good practice that other road users give the cycling fans priority.

Tors Peerson as a 30 year old started working for Fred Walker in 1918 as a storeperson in the manufacturing of foodstuffs in South Melbourne Victoria . One of these products was Bonox. In 1923 Walker and Peerson along with a chemist named Cyril Callister developed a yeast extract under the name of Vegemite. In 1924 an arrangement to keep the business from going under Walker combined with a new partner James Lewis Kraft to manufacture cheese in Melbourne. The business became the Kraft Walker Cheese Company. Walker had the drive and energy to run the company but lacked the skills of communicating to his workers. Under the guidance of Walker, Peerson established a worker's social club in 1927.Morning tea breaks commenced in 1928.A modest canteen and first aid facilities soon followed. Walker and Peerson's introduction in 1932 of the Bedaux System of the time and motion studies was based on the wish to make warehousing work less arduous. As a scientifically designed work systems increased productivity, bonuses paid to warehouse workers rose and jobs in companies were keenly sought.

Born into a minor aristocratic Parsi family, Jeejeebhoy was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1912. Generally, the Indian Army officers who fought as pilots during World War I were of European rather than Indian descent. Before WWI it was the policy of the War Office to deny commissions to applicants not of pure European descent on the grounds that \"a British private will never follow a half-caste or native officer.\" However, a shortage of pilots resulted in a change in policy and a handful of Indian military pilots served during that war as officers of the Royal Flying Corps and later the Royal Air Force, rather than as officers of the Indian Army. Jeejeebhoy held an FAI accredited Aviator Certificate while undergoing training with the RFC. He completed his flying training at Stinson School at San Antonio, Texas on 2 May 1916 and held American Aviator certificate #495. The first of five Indian military pilots, on 6 November 1916 Jeejeebhoy was promoted to temporary Honorary 2nd Lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps on the General List. However, Lieutenant Jeejeebhoy’s active career with the RFC was brief as his papers in The National Archives show that he fell ill in January 1917 while training at the RFC's Oxford School of Instruction and he was suspended from training to convalesce. In May 1917 a medical board decided that he was permanently unfit for further service, and an entry in The London Gazette of 29 May 1917 announced that \"Temp Hon 2nd Lt Jeejeebhoy Piroshaw Bomanjee Jeejeebhoy relinquishes his commission on account of ill health\". He was given an honorary commission of 2/Lt at the time of discharge. In 1920 he was given an honorary commission as Captain and may have served in the Air Ministry of the British government in the early 1920s. Jeejeebhoy died in 1950 aged 58 and is buried in the Parsi section of Brookwood Cemetery, Surrey.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Ashland City is a town in and the county seat of Cheatham County, Tennessee, United States.
