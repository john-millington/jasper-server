Shot entirely in West Hartlepool and Seaton Carew the film features the cooling tower and blast furnaces of the local British Steel North Works foreshadowing images in Alien, Blade Runner and Black Rain. The central element of the Boy and Bicycle is re-used in Scott's advert for Hovis of the early 1970s. The film features Scott's younger brother Tony Scott as the boy. “We were both experiencing the process that would fundamentally take us through our live together, in terms of making movies” Ridley Scott commented about the film and his brother. Scott secured finance from the British Film Institute to complete the editing and sound in 1965 including a track by John Barry called \"Onward Christian Spacemen'\" (which originally appeared as the B-side of a cover version of the theme to The Human Jungle television series). Scott wanted to use the existing recording by Barry, but the composer was so impressed by the young filmmaker he agreed to produce a new recording for the film at limited cost.

The film is an early anime presentation for a slightly older audience, at a time when there wasn't much competition and before the clichés were established for this genre of action. The anime was made during the Cold War and so the tank was hijacked from a futuristic cargo plane and was designed to withstand a neutron bomb attack, even if its crew would be killed by that weapon, for the tank was computerized to continue to fight on its own. When out of ammunition, the robot tank would automatically explode. One point which marks the animation studio of this film is that to save money there are many scenes which are monochromatic.

Like the Canadian federal government, Prince Edward Island uses a Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which members are elected to the Legislative Assembly through general elections. The party with the most seats forms Government. A Premier of Prince Edward Island and Executive Council of Prince Edward Island are formally appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in the name of The Queen. The premier acts as Prince Edward Island's head of government, while the Queen of Canada acts as head of state. The legislature was originally bicameral, with an upper house called the Legislative Council of Prince Edward Island and a lower house called the House of Assembly of Prince Edward Island. The Legislative Council also held executive power until 1839. In 1893 the houses were amalgamated into the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island. Unlike other provinces that eliminated their upper house, the assembly continued to have a distinction between members elected as Councillors and members elected as Assemblymen. This distinction was eliminated in 1996, giving all members the title Member of the Legislative Assembly, upon the change from dual ridings (two members per district) to single ridings (one member per district) in the Legislative Assembly.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"XtreamLok was an information security company in Brisbane, Australia.

While Lister is left in tears and Cat has lost interest after the cartoon that preceded the film, Rimmer is disgusted at the plotline. Rimmer tells everyone that he finds it unbelievable that a man would give up his dreams for a woman he loves even though he'll never see her again. The discussion is halted when Starbug comes into contact with another craft that doesn't show up on the monitors. It is a Holoship called the Enlightenment, consisting of a vessel and crew that are entirely computer-generated holograms. What is more, the crew are holograms of Space Corps elite personnel. The fact that the ship's regulations impose sex twice a day is an added bonus. Rimmer falls in love with one of the Enlightenment's crew members, Commander Nirvanah Crane. With an existence where he can eat, drink, touch, feel and taste, Rimmer feels that the Enlightenment is his true spiritual home. However one obstacle stands in Rimmer's way: Enlightenment already has a full crew and new members can only join on a dead-man's-boots basis. If Rimmer succeeds in an intelligence contest it will be at the expense of a fellow hologram's existence. Rimmer might not be excessively bright but he is shrewd and furthermore he's got a perfect plan — he'll cheat. With the assistance of a reluctant Kryten, Rimmer uses a mind-patching operation to significantly increase his IQ. But during the contest the mind-patch fails, as his mind rejects it. Despite this, he is assigned to the Enlightenment when his opponent suddenly withdraws from the challenge. Rimmer bids farewell to his acquaintances on Red Dwarf. Rimmer arrives on the Enlightenment and is given Nirvanah Crane's quarters. Rimmer didn't realise that Crane was his opponent in the intelligence contest — she had sacrificed herself so that he could live the life of his dreams. Going back on his earlier statement that career would always come before love, Rimmer resigns his new commission and returns to Red Dwarf, so that Nirvanah can be re-instated.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Michael Charles Sanford (born April 20, 1955) is an American college football coach and former player.

Pietermaritzburg, Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa, 1939; d Bolivia 1981) was an acclaimed jurist, a campaigning legal academic and a prominent human rights and anti-apartheid activist in South Africa in the 1970s and early 1980s. This \"maverick law professor\" was prosecuted twice (and convicted once) by the South African state prosecutor and privately sued once, all such actions being based on his supposed contempt of court. He was indeed a fearless critic of the apartheid legal system, in particular of the judiciary's racial bias in setting death penalties, but also of imprisonment, torture and solitary confinement; freedom of speech; and the role (and shortcomings) of the judiciary. A gifted linguist and great traveller, his post-graduate studies took him to the universities of Heidelberg, Bonn and Strasbourg, and in the process he became fluent in English, French, and German, and met his future wife, Traute von Oehsen. Despite his undoubted intellectual brilliance, he was anything but an otherworldly academic; indeed, as Cry the Beloved Country author, Alan Paton, noted, his \"intellectual eminence was hidden from many by his downright earthiness, and by the downright earthiness of his language\". Professor van Niekerk was also prominent in campaigning against the destruction of Durban's architectural heritage, in the process making enemies of many commercial and property interests, thus proving his own adage that \"if you haven't made enemies, you've made nothing\". He thought nothing of climbing a ladder to paint the roof of Durban's Old Station that he and others campaigned to save. A graduate of Stellenbosch University, he served as Professor of Law at the Howard College School of Law, University of KwaZulu-Natal until his death, also holding a professorial chair at the University of the Witwatersrand. His publications include the posthumous \"The Cloistered Virtue: Freedom of Speech and the Administration of Justice in the Western World\"; \"The Taboos in legal research - a personal case history\" (in which he discussed his trial and conviction for contempt of court); and, reflecting his other campaigning interest as well as his love for his home city, \"Durban At Your Feet, an alternative guide to a city\". In recent years Barend van Niekerk's leading role in campaigning for human rights in apartheid South Africa has been acknowledged by, inter alia, UNHCR Special Rapporteur and International Court of Justice judge John Dugard, Constitutional Court judge Kate O'Regan, ANC activist and Robben Island prisoner Mac Maharaj, Sir Sydney Kentridge QC, Australian judge David Ipp and Kwa-Zulu Natal's premier, Sibusiso Ndebele. Barend van Niekerk died of heart failure while travelling at altitude in Bolivia in 1981. He was survived by his wife and two daughters, both as linguistically earthy. The University of Kwa-Zulu Natal gives an annual Barend Van Niekerk Prize for the most outstanding Jurisprudence law student. At van Niekerk's funeral service, Alan Paton, who gave the eulogy, noted that the form of blessing used \"asks God to give Barend peace, now and for ever. Well I am not sure that Barend would want peace for ever.

Born in Székesfehérvár, Orbán studied law at Eötvös Loránd University, graduating in 1987. He briefly studied political science at Pembroke College, Oxford before entering politics in the wake of the Autumn of Nations at the head of the reformist Alliance of Young Democrats (Fiatal Demokraták Szövetsége) student movement—the nascent Fidesz. He became a nationally known politician after giving an address at the 1989 reburial of Imre Nagy and other martyrs of the 1956 revolution, in which he openly demanded that Soviet troops withdraw from the country. After the transition to democracy in 1990, he was elected to the National Assembly and served as leader of Fidesz's parliamentary caucus until 1993. Under his leadership, Orbán shifted Fidesz away from its original classical liberal, pro-European integration platform toward centre-right national conservatism. After Fidesz won a plurality of seats in the National Assembly in the 1998 elections, Orbán was Prime Minister for four years at the head of a right-wing coalition government. Fidesz narrowly lost the 2002 and 2006 elections to the Socialist Party, and Orbán spent eight years as the leader of the opposition. The Socialists' rising unpopularity, exacerbated by PM Ferenc Gyurcsány's \"Őszöd speech\", saw Orbán reelected to the premiership in 2010 in a landslide victory (in coalition with the Christian Democrats). At the helm of a parliamentary supermajority, Orbán's cabinet spearheaded major constitutional and legislative reforms. Fidesz retained its supermajority in the 2014 and 2018 elections. Orbán's social conservatism, soft Euroscepticism and advocacy of what he describes as an \"illiberal state\" have attracted significant international attention.

This metropolis has a population of about 1,3 million (1,276,000 million inhabitants) thus being Argentina's third most populated urban settlement, after Buenos Aires and Córdoba. The Greater Rosario comprises Rosario itself (population about 910,000) and a large area around it, spreading in all directions except eastward (because of the Paraná River). Directly to the south it includes the city of Villa Gobernador Gálvez, with a population of about 75,000, at about 10 km from the center of Rosario. To the west and south-west there are several smaller towns and cities (Funes, Roldán, Pérez, Soldini); Roldán is 23 km from Rosario's center. These settlements were incorporated into the metropolis due to their vicinity to major roads leading into Rosario, and many people living there habitually commute to Rosario. The farthest end is to the north, following the coast of the river; from Rosario one finds, in succession and usually merging into each other, the towns of Granadero Baigorria, Capitán Bermúdez, Fray Luis Beltrán, San Lorenzo (already in a different departamento, with a population of over 40,000), and Puerto General San Martín, the last being at a distance of 35 km from Rosario. The north of the Greater Rosario is one end of an area traditionally called Cordón Industrial (\"Industrial Corridor\"), since it was traditionally a heavily industrialized productive region.

The appeal to consensus arises from the fact that humans do not fully understand or agree upon the nature of knowledge or ontology, often making it uncertain what is real, given the vast inconsistencies between individual subjectivities. We can, however, seek to obtain some form of consensus, with others, of what is real. We can use this consensus as a pragmatic guide, either on the assumption that it seems to approximate some kind of valid reality, or simply because it is more \"practical\" than perceived alternatives. Consensus reality therefore refers to the agreed-upon concepts of reality which people in the world, or a culture or group, believe are real (or treat as real), usually based upon their common experiences as they believe them to be; anyone who does not agree with these is sometimes stated to be \"in effect... living in a different world.\" Throughout history this has also raised a social question as to the effects of a society in which all individuals do not agree upon the same reality. Children have sometimes been described or viewed as \"inexperience[d] with consensus reality,\" though are described as such with the expectation that their perspective will progressively form closer to the consensus reality of their society as they age.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne (9 October 1727 &ndash; 19 February 1794) was a French churchman, politician and finance minister of Louis XVI.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"St Kilda East is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 6 km south-east from Melbourne's Central Business District.

It contains the first portion of the Sermon on the Mount, which will also take up the next chapter and a half. Portions are similar to the Sermon on the Plain in Luke 6, but much is found only in Matthew. In John Wesley's division of the Sermon chapter five outlines the ethical principles of the truly religious. It is one of the most discussed and analyzed chapters of the New Testament. Kissinger reports that among Early Christians no chapter was more often cited by early scholars. The same is true in modern scholarship. In the Middle Ages an interpretation was developed that the chapter only applied to a select group, and not to the general populace. Martin Luther, in a discussion of this chapter, was highly critical of the Catholic view. He wrote that \"this fifth chapter has fallen into the hands of the vulgar pigs and asses, the jurists and sophists, the right hand of that jackass of a pope and of his mamelukes.\" The source of Matthew 5 is uncertain. It contains only a handful of parallels with Mark, but does have a number of loose parallels with Luke's Sermon on the Plain. For those who believe in the two-source hypothesis it indicates that much of this text likely came from Q. However, Harvey King McArthur notes that the parallels in Luke tend to be very loose, far further away than most areas they overlap. There are also a considerable number of verses that have no parallel in Luke. McArthur thus theorizes that there was an extra step between the sources Matthew and Luke used than usual.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The name Polo has been used for four tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"KEIB (1150 AM) is a radio station licensed to Los Angeles, California, and serving Greater Los Angeles.

The expectations of the strike were to bring the world’s busiest harbor to a virtual standstill. Captain William Bradley, president of Local 333, United Maritime Division, International Longshoremen’s Association, stated two days before the actual strike that a strike vote had been taken the previous week-end, during a breakdown of negotiations with the Employers Wage Adjustment Committee, which represents the owners and operators in this port. The union’s demands were in the form of substantial pay increases, a reduction in work hours, two weeks paid vacation per year, and an end to paying for their transportation home when relieved of duty away from their home port. “They impose on us at every turn,” the men said. “Sometimes we are relieved on our boats as far away as New Haven and Providence, and we have to come home at our expense.” The average hourly pay scale at that time on the tugboats was as follows: Captains, $1.10; engineers, $1.06; firemen, 72 cents; extra firemen, oilers, deckhands and cooks, 67 cents an hour. The men had demanded an “over the board” increase to $1.35 for all unlicensed ratings, and from $1.57 to $1.83 for the captains. They also demanded two weeks’ vacation with pay, and a reduction in the work week to 40 hours from 48 hours. James P. McAllister, with a two-day growth of beard, stood inside with the employer’s wage adjustment committee, all admittedly groggy form the long negotiations. “It’s still the same,” he said “We are getting pretty disgusted; we’ve been at this since last October.” The apparent hopelessness of the situation was based on the fact that the negotiation committee, whose recommendations were flatly rejected by the militant members of the Union the previous Friday, lacks the power needed to close and agreement, or to notify the employers what minimum terms the union would accept. Their position is that the employers are unable to offer more money and as to the 40-hour work, they see that as a way to build up more overtime The city of New York made drastic moves to offset the effects that the Mayor declared would come to fruition because of the strike. Mayor O’Dwyer announced that the city would have oil and coal go on a priority system since the tugboats that deliver them would be out. The city would endure brownouts and the subway system would go heat-less. All public schools would be shutdown effective February 10, and many of them would be used for hospital purposes or to house persons who are without fuel. All coal and oil would be barred from places of amusement, including theatres and movie houses; fuel strictly rationed to public utilities, hospitals and other institutions. Interior temperatures would be cut to 60 degrees, except in buildings that house the sick and aged. Finally a brownout would be ordered, shutting off all outdoor signs and dimming street lights where-ever possible. The Mayor’s over-reaction to the situation was solved one week later when the striking Tugboat workers returned to work on February 14, 1946. This was accomplished because both sides agreed to a 3-man arbitration panel to determine the final outcome of the contract negotiations. Most people agreed that the situation would most likely have been solved sooner or not happened at all if a clear-cut policy on wages and prices had not been so long in coming from Washington.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The 2016 Auckland Open (currently sponsored by ASB) was a joint 2016 ATP World Tour and 2016 WTA Tour tennis tournament, played on outdoor hard courts.

Rape involving at least two or more violators (typically at least three ) is reported throughout the world. Systematic information and statistics on the extent of the problem is limited. One study showed that offenders and victims in gang rape incidents were younger with a higher possibility of being unemployed. Gang rapes involved more alcohol and drug use, night attacks and severe sexual assault outcomes and less victim resistance and fewer weapons than individual rapes. Another study found that group sexual assaults were more violent and had greater resistance from the victim than individual sexual assaults and that victims of group sexual assaults were more likely to seek crisis and police services, to contemplate suicide and seek psychotherapy than those involved in individual assaults. The two groups were about the same in the amount of drug use and drinking during the assault.

From 1855 to 1858 Levi studied at the Leipzig Conservatory, and after a series of travels which took him to Paris, he obtained his first post as music director at Saarbrücken, which post he exchanged for that at Mannheim in 1861. From 1862 to 1864 he was chief conductor of the German Opera in Rotterdam, then till 1872 at Karlsruhe, when he went to Munich, a post he held until 1896, when ill-health compelled him to resign. Levi also taught at the Leipzig Conservatory, where his pupils included the conductor Emil Steinbach. Levi's name is indissolubly connected with the increased public appreciation of Wagner's music. He was a longtime friend of Wagner; when preparing for the inaugural Bayreuth Festival, he wrote to his father, \"Wagner is the best and noblest of men ... I thank God daily for the privilege to be close to such a man. It is the most beautiful experience of my life\". He conducted the first performance of Parsifal at Bayreuth in 1882, even though Wagner initially objected to this and was quoted as saying that Levi should be baptized before conducting \"Parsifal\". Levi was connected with the musical life at Bayreuth during the remainder of his career. He visited London in 1895, and died in Munich in 1900 and was interred in a Mausoleum in the grounds of his villa later that year in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.

Although some consider her Manuel's second wife, Michel Kuršanskis has argued that Rusudan may have been simply his mistress. Kuršanskis also notes that the evidence is insufficient to determine if Theodora was identical with one of the princesses of Trebizond mentioned in the Chronicle of Bishop Stephanos who married a noble or the king of Georgia, or if she had been a nun &mdash; much as Anna Anachoutlou was before her usurpation in the following century. In 1284, with the help of Georgian King of Imereti, David VI Narin she managed to seize the crown from her half-brother, Emperor John II. John II may have taken refuge in Tripolis. Shortly afterwards she was defeated and John regained his throne, but she had managed to reign long enough to have minted her own coins.

The whale, distressed by the harpoon, attempts to flee and thus drags the whalers' longboat along with it. The speed of the \"sleigh ride\" would vary depending on the species of the whale, with certain species (e.g. humpbacks) giving faster rides. The sperm whale was the whale that caused the longest drag events, reaching speeds of 23 mph (37 km/h). The length of the drag for the sailors would last as long as the whale could swim before it became exhausted. Fin whales and sei whales were the most dangerous species, as they would dive scores of fathoms deep taking the longboat and its occupants beneath the surface if possible. Once the whale had exhausted its energy, the sailors (if still alive) would kill it and harvest its oil. The discovery of petroleum and natural gas in Pennsylvania in the mid-1800s began a slow end to the whale hunting by American whalers. Other nations followed as either they discovered petroleum reserves of their own, or the increase in the trade of natural gas and oil rendered whale hunting less worthy of the dangers inherent in its pursuit. Japan still persists in the practice to this day; Norway finally closed its last rendering station at Grytviken (South Georgia Island) about 1965.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Karen Gordon Mills (born September 14, 1953) served as the 23rd Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).

Inspired by pioneering artists such as Nitzer Ebb, Front 242, Die Krupps and DAF, Spetsnaz was formed as a reaction against Futurepop and to revive what Nilsson and Stålberg saw as \"old school\" EBM music. In November 2006, the duo cancelled their then upcoming tour with And One. Side-Line and other members of the alternative music press reported that they had split, citing differences between the two members. However, only a day later, their record company Out of Line posted a news story denying the split. They have since \"reunited\" for a gig with DAF.Partei, and released \"Deadpan\" in November 2007. In 2008, Pontus Stålberg formed the side project '''Turnbull A.C's' with Lars Karlsson and released the album Let's Get Pissed!'', which sounds very similar to Spetsnaz but with a more raw feel. The band name was taken from one of the street gangs in the 1979 film The Warriors.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Séverine Ferrer (born 31 October 1977) is a French singer.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Saralasin is a partial agonist of angiotensin II receptors, though it is commonly mistaken as a competitive antagonist. Saralasin's distinction as a partial agonist is based on the fact that its therapeutic effect (i.e. reduced hypertension) is only observed in patients with high plasma angiotensin II levels, but in patients with low angiotensin II levels Saralasin causes hypertension. In other words, the effects of Saralasin on the angiotensin II receptor in the absence of angiotensin II is pharmacodynamically similar to angiotensin II itself thus it is a partial agonist, because if it was an antagonist it would not elicit an effect when bound to its receptor. Saralasin is an angiotensin II analogue, containing sarcosine-1 and alanine-8, hence the name (sarcosine, alanine, angiotensin).","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Antillenhuis (English: ''Antilles' House'') was the cabinet of the Minister Plenipotentiary of the Netherlands Antilles in The Hague, the Netherlands.

It lies at the south-western edge of the present Highland Region. It includes Knoydart, Morar, Moidart, Ardnamurchan, and the Small Isles. The medieval lordship of Garmoran was ruled by the MacRuari's, descendants of Somerled, and later formed part of the Lordship of the Isles. Castle Tioram, at the entrance to Loch Moidart, was one of the residences of the lords of Garmoran. In 1284 when his son the prince died, Alexander III called Ailin mac Ruaidhri, the ruler of Garmoran, (along with all the Earls and Barons of Scotland) to make them accept Margaret, Maid of Norway as the heir. Ailin had died by 1296, by which time he had fathered two illegitimate sons, Ruaidhri and Lachlan, and Christina, his sole legitimate heir. However, When Christina succeeded to the extensive estates of her father she resigned a large proportion of them to Ruaidhri. In 1343, King David II issued a charter to Raghnall Mac Ruaidhrí, granting him the islands of Uist, Barra, Eigg and Rhum (Ywest ... Barra ... Egghe ... Romme) and eight pennylands of Garmoran (Garw Morwarne), which were defined as 'Moidart (Mudeworth), Morar (Mordhowor), Arisaig (Aresaig) and Knoydart (Cundeworth) with their pertinents'. In October 1346, Raghnall Mac Ruaidhrí was assassinated at Elcho Nunnery near Perth as the result of a quarrel with Uilleam III, Earl of Ross. Raghnall was the \"last chieftain of the MacRuaris\" and Amie mac Ruari, who married John of Islay, Lord of the Isles, was his sole heir. John of Islay later divorced her although the \"unvarying tradition\" of the Gàidhealtachd recorded in the late 19th century was that Amie had given her husband no grounds for doing so and lived on her own on her estates until her death. The divorce annulled John of Islay's rights to her lands, although he managed to procure a royal charter to them in which her name is not even mentioned. Their son Ranald successfully petitioned for the return of much of the Macruairi lands including Garmoran. He became the progenitor of Clan Macdonald of Clanranald and Clan MacDonell of Glengarry.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The 2001 Summer Deaflympics, officially known as the 19th Summer Deaflympics, is an international multi-sport event that was celebrated from July 16 to August 1, 2001 in Rome, Italy.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Lwin Moe (, ; born 1970) is a two-time Myanmar Academy Award winning Burmese film actor.

Ergaleium, collectively known as the tuberous sundews', is a subgenus of three sections of tuberous species in the genus Drosera''. The three sections represent natural groups, including the rosetted species (section Erythrorhiza), the fan-leaved species (section Stolonifera), and the erect or scrambling species (section Ergaleium). The subgenus was first formally described by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1824, but the exact taxonomy has been changed frequently since then. In 1848, Jules Émile Planchon reorganized the species into sections, series, and subseries. George Bentham disagreed with Planchon's classification and so in 1864 he divided the genus into just two sections, with all tuberous species in sect. Ergaleium and those without tubers in sect. Rorella. Ludwig Diels reclassified the genus in his 1906 monograph of the family, recognizing subgenus Ergaleium and two sections within it: Erythrorhiza (Planchon) Diels and Polypeltes Diels. Another reclassification occurred in 1977, when Larry Eugene DeBuhr added section Stolonifera, which was based on Planchon's subseries Stoloniferae. Section Polypeltes is now known by the older autonym sect. Ergaleium.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"\"Beware of the Dog\" is a 1944 World War II story by Roald Dahl which was originally published in ''Harper's Magazine and later appeared in his Over to You'' collection.
