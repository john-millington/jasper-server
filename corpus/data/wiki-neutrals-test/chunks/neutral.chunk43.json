The term is also used figuratively to describe the state of awaiting execution (\"being on death row\"), even in places where no special facility or separate unit for condemned inmates exists. After a person is found guilty of a capital offense, the judge will give the jury the option of imposing a death sentence or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. It is then up to a jury to decide whether to give the death sentence; this usually has to be a unanimous decision. If the jury agrees on death, the defendant will remain on death row during appeal and habeas corpus procedures, which can drag on for many years. Opponents of capital punishment claim that a prisoner's isolation and uncertainty over his or her fate constitute a form of mental cruelty and that especially long-time death row inmates are liable to become mentally ill, if they are not already. This is referred to as the death row phenomenon. In extreme cases some inmates may attempt to commit suicide.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Rychlik (formerly German Reichen) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Sulęcin, within Sulęcin County, Lubusz Voivodeship, in western Poland.

An all-rounder, he was a right-handed opening batsman and slow left arm bowler. He played for Worcestershire, captaining the side in 1946, and also captained Oxford University and Transvaal. In all he scored 4,700 runs and took 240 wickets in first-class cricket. Born in Repton, Derbyshire, Singleton attended Shrewsbury School, captaining the school cricket team. He then went to Oxford, and won a blue three times. In 1934 he claimed what was to remain his career-best innings return of 6-44 against HDG Leveson-Gower's XI at Reigate. He also made his Worcestershire debut in 1934, playing for both county and university for several seasons, and in the last of these (1937) he captained the university side and was selected by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) to tour Canada. He then played for Worcestershire (as an amateur) and while teaching at Repton School. Singleton later recalled that in Worcestershire's match against the Australians in 1938 he just failed to hold on to a catch at leg slip that would have dismissed Bradman for nought: in the event he went on to score 258! In Worcestershire's final game before the outbreak of war, Singleton made the first of his four centuries, hitting an unbeaten 102 against Nottinghamshire, and when county cricket resumed in 1946, Singleton was made captain of Worcestershire, and enjoyed the most productive summer of his career: he scored 1,773 runs in first-class cricket at an average of 34.09, as well as taking 43 wickets at 28.23. He made three centuries and ten half centuries, his best being 164 in a nine-wicket victory over Warwickshire in late June. Whilst serving with the Royal Air Force in Rhodesia during the war, Singleton had met his wife Polly; they married in 1941 and had five children: three sons and two daughters. After the end of the 1946 English season they emigrated to Rhodesia permanently, and although he concentrated on farming, he played nine times for the Rhodesian side between 1946–47 and 1949–50, once again being appointed as captain. After he had retired from playing, Singleton spent nearly twenty years (1964–1983) teaching at Peterhouse Boys' School in Marondera, and in 1985 he and his wife emigrated again, this time to Australia where they settled in Wagga Wagga. Singleton was not a fan of modern one-day cricket – what he called \"the pyjama game\" - and believed that it had had an adverse effect on Test cricket itself. He continued to follow cricket via television until he was afflicted with Alzheimer's Disease, and died in Wagga Wagga at the age of 84.Singleton also played league football.

Nosy Mitsio is very rural: it has no infrastructural development and is populated mainly by small family villages. There are several primary schools and very limited access to healthcare services. Most inhabitants of Nosy Mitsio are subsistence rice farmers who also use a variety of fishing methods and shellfish gathering. Supplemental income is provided through salting fish, diving for sea cucumbers, and gathering coconuts - all of which is sold at Port St Louis, the nearest port on mainland Madagascar.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"South Africa competed in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland from 23 July – 3 August 2014.

TOGA emphasized the tropical oceans and their relationship to the global atmosphere. Underlying TOGA is the premise that the dynamic adjustment of the ocean in the tropics is far more rapid than at higher latitudes. Thus disturbances emanating from the western Pacific Ocean (such as El Niño) may propagate across the basin on time scales of weeks compared to years for corresponding basin-wide propagation at higher latitudes. The significance of shorter dynamic times scales near the equator is that they are similar to those of highly energetic atmospheric modes. This similarity allows the formation of coupled modes between the ocean and the atmosphere. TOGA was instrumental in developing a comprehensive observing system for the equatorial Pacific Ocean and laid important groundwork for ENSO prediction, data assimilation and understanding of air-sea interaction.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Cambia is an Australian-based global non-profit social enterprise focusing on open science, biology, innovation system reform and intellectual property.

Construction was begun in 1936 and completed in 1941. The dam is long and  high. The construction is unique with buttressed arched wings on either side of the nine spillway gates rather than the usual filled concrete. It has two 11,250 kilowatt generators which were used during peak demand periods that are no longer in use. Morris Sheppard was in 1938 one of Texas’ United States Senators. The dam was named for him in honor of his efforts in obtaining funding for the project. The lake is located where the Brazos River cuts through the Palo Pinto Hills. The canyon thus formed provided a favorable site for impoundment of the reservoir and accounts for the unusual depth of the lake and the resulting clarity of the water. There are several stories about the origin of the name Possum Kingdom for this part of the Brazos River valley. The most accepted version attributes the name to Ike Sablosky who settled in the region in the early twentieth century. Sablosky was a businessman, a Russian Jewish immigrant who came to America at the age of 13. He arrived in Mineral Wells, Texas from Indianapolis in 1905. Sablosky was suffering from stomach trouble and believed he was dying. Mineral Wells was then nationally famous as a health spa and Sablosky offered an employee of one of the spa hotels ten cents a day for ten days to be allowed to drink all of the mineral water he wanted. The employee accepted and Sablosky claimed that within ten days his stomach problems were cured. Sablosky then went into the fur and hide business, dealing in, among other things, possum pelts. His best suppliers of these hunted in the canyon of the Brazos and Sablosky began greeting them by saying, “Here are the boys from the Possum Kingdom.” Sablosky went on to be a prominent businessman in Dallas. Before his death he left millions of dollars to charity. The lake is home to the famous, a sheer break in the cliffs around the lake. The lake's name was the title of a popular 1990s song \"Possum Kingdom\" by The Toadies. The lake is home to Possum Kingdom State Park, a state park governed by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department The Possum Kingdom Lake area suffered major wildfires in 2011 during a severe drought, first in April with 160 homes destroyed and again in August–September with 39 homes and 9 recreational vehicles lost. The cause of the second 2011 fire was an electrical spark on the 101 Ranch The first week of August 2012 brought more wildfires to the PK vicinity (between the dam & Graford) which were possibly ignited by lightning strikes amid the extremely drought-ridden countryside. Texas Governor Perry authorized the Texas military forces to assist in battling them. Several Chinook helicopters were assigned to the Palo Pinto county efforts. The fires were brought under control over a period of days & nights. The lake was originally at the level of the cliffs resort which caused the massive c shaped ridges in the side walls of the shore.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Dr. Symeon C.

In a way, they were opposed to stridentism. The group had its origins in friendships and literary collaborations that were formed among students attending Mexico City's elite National Preparatory School; that is where founding members José Gorostiza, Carlos Pellicer, Bernardo Ortiz de Montellano, Enrique González Rojo, and Jaime Torres Bodet met for the first time. This core group would all go on to attend together the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, specifically its Faculty of Jurisprudence, where they would come under the influence of professors Antonio Caso and Enrique González Martínez, both of whom were associated with the literary society de México. Following this, a new generationally oriented and constituted society named the Nuevo Ateneo de la Juventud was formed in 1918. As a literary generation, the group was inheritor to modernismo, the work of Ramón López Velarde, and the tradition of the European avant garde. It was during this time that work by Los Contemporáneos began appearing in magazines and student periodicals such as Pegaso (1917) and San-Ev-Ank (1918). In 1921, Salvador Novo and Xavier Villaurrutia joined the group; Jorge Cuesta and Gilberto Owen would later enter its orbit as well. Los Contemporáneos would benefit from government support during the period when José Vasconcelos was Secretary of Public Education (1920–24). Antonieta Rivas Mercado was also a member, as well as their patron. Members of the group began writing for and collaborating in magazines and other literary venues. They also started their own publications, the first of which, México Moderno, was described as an \"art and literature review,\" it ran from 1920-23. La Falange (December 1922-February 1923), labeled a \"review of Latin culture,\" and Ulises (May 1927-February 1928; see also Teatro Ulises), billed as a source of \"curiosity and criticism,\" were two other short-lived, though influential, literary journals founded and directed by Contemporáneos. In 1928, Torres Bodet inaugurated the groups longest-lived editorial endeavor, the magazine Contemporáneos. From June 1928 until December 1931, the magazine would publish, along with representative work by its founding members and allies, pieces by older more established Mexican, Latin American, and Spanish writers, as well as translations of favored American and European authors. The rich and varied content of the publication was complemented by expensive details such as fine magazine paper and photographs and illustrations (made possible by continued government subventions). In 1928, Jorge Cuesta would also publish, under the aegis of the Contemporáneos press, a poetic anthology titled Antología de la poesía mexicana moderna, which would give rise to heated polemics because of what were perceived, in certain literary and intellectual quarters, as glaring editorial omissions. Needless to say, much of the anthology's pages were taken up by the poetic output of Contemporáneos.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"'''Saint George's Cathedral''' is an Ethiopian Orthodox church in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

He was also a soldier and a politician. James Tilton was born in Delaware to Dr. James and Frances Gibson Tilton. The family moved to Indiana in 1827. He studied to become a surveyor, joined the United States Navy and was wounded twice in the Mexican-American War. As a politician, Tilton campaigned vigorously in Indiana for presidential candidate Franklin Pierce, and was rewarded with the position of Surveyor General of the Washington Territory. He traveled to Olympia, Washington, arriving in the spring of 1855 ahead of his wife, children, other family members, and a young mulatto slave named Charles Mitchell. In 1855, Tilton tried to establish a principal meridian for the Washington Territory, as the pre-existing Oregon-based Willamette Meridian was not convenient for his purposes, but his proposal was rejected by his superior. Tilton became involved in the case of the slave Charles Mitchell. Mitchell had been contacted by free blacks from the British Crown Colony of Victoria (where slavery was illegal). On September 24, 1860, the then twelve-year-old stowed away on the steamship Eliza Anderson, assisted by the ship's cook, James Allen. He was discovered; Captain John Fleming intended to return him to his master and locked the boy up before sailing into Victoria on September 25. However, he was forced by a writ of habeas corpus to surrender the boy to official custody so his legal status could be determined. James Tilton lodged a protest, and the story was covered by newspapers ranging from the Victoria Colonist to the San Francisco Daily Evening Bulletin. On September 26, Justice Cameron ruled that Charles Mitchell was free. Tilton continued to live in Olympia for some years after his term as Surveyor General ended in 1861. After his defeat in an election for territorial delegate, he returned briefly to Indiana and then to the family home in WIlmginton, but he returned to the Pacific Northwest to work for the Northern Pacific Railroad Company and is almost certainly the \"railroad surveyor James Tilton\" credited with being the first to climb Denny Mountain in 1867.

Because of the broad support and the ubiquitous nature of the RADIUS protocol, it is often used by Internet service providers (ISPs) and enterprises to manage access to the Internet or internal networks, wireless networks, and integrated e-mail services. These networks may incorporate modems, digital subscriber line (DSL), access points, virtual private networks (VPNs), network ports, web servers, etc. RADIUS is a client/server protocol that runs in the application layer, and can use either TCP or UDP as transport. Network access servers, the gateways that control access to a network, usually contain a RADIUS client component that communicates with the RADIUS server. RADIUS is often the back-end of choice for 802.1X authentication as well.

They are typically used when the cryptographic hash functions in the method cannot be proven to possess the mathematical properties required by the proof.

Hans Hagen has published over four hundred articles in journals, books and conference proceedings. His research interests are deep and very broad. His work concentrates on physically based modeling, curve and surface interrogation and topology-based visualization. Particular emphasis is placed on variational design. The key idea is include energy minimization as an integral part of the algorithm and the underlying mathematics. This concept is now industry standard. Hans Hagen has a strong background in differential geometry and topology. His geometric modeling publication record started with a work on geometric splines, where he introduced a torsion continuous spline curve. Thereafter he developed together with Guido Brunnett and Paolo Santarelli the Variational Design methodology and a solution to the twist input and compatibility twist problem of the Coons patches. Triangular patches did not have \"curvature modeling facilities\" for many years. Hans Hagen had a strong impact on the Geometric Modeling community. He started the world-class Dagstuhl Seminar Series on Geometric Modeling that regularly brings together the leading experts of the field in a relaxed unmatched format that stimulated a lot of ideas. He served as associated editor for major journals like CAD and CAGD for many years. In addition, he served on numerous program committees. Regarding scientific visualization, he had a great impact too. From 1999 to 2003 he was the editor in chief of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics. He serves since many years as International Liaison Officer of the Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee. Currently, he is on the Steering Committees of IEEE SciVis and EuroVis, the two leading conferences in Scientific Visualization.

He is most well known for his discovery of the wreckage of a Royal New Zealand Air Force Airspeed Oxford, ending a 32-year New Zealand aviation mystery. Clince was born in 1953 in Eltham, Taranaki. A keen hunter from an early age, Clince left Stratford High School at 18 years and took up a job with the New Zealand Forest Service as a varmint exterminator. He was tasked hunting goats on Mt. Taranaki (then Mt. Egmont) and surrounding National Park. He also had a stint as an exterminator on Raoul Island. He has been credited with over 5000 confirmed kills over his 16 year career as a professional hunter. An expert on both the local geography and varmint, Clince assisted with various technical reports and academic studies relating to the area. Following his work with the NZ Forest Service, Clince worked as a caretaker for the Stratford Mountain House on the eastern slopes of Mt Taranaki. Clince is most well-known for the discovery of an RNZAF Airspeed Oxford twin engine bomber-training aircraft wreckage on the slopes of Mt Taranaki. The aircraft, an Oxford I, NZ277/P2030 with Pilot Officer Rodney Dandy and crew Sgt Douglas Martyn, Sgt Graham Martin and Sgt Edward Dodson, departed Bell Block Airfield, New Plymouth on 23 October 1942 on a training mission. It is assumed that due to heavy cloud, the crew made navigational errors which resulted in a crash at 4,000 feet. No crew members survived. The RNZAF and local authorities discontinued searches for the aircraft after three months. 32 years later on 15 January 1974 Clince discovered the crash site. Assuming it was already documented, Clince messed around with the wreckage including tampering with the controls and .303 machine gun. He was alerted to the presence of human remains by his dog who had recovered a bone. He then made a hasty retreat down the mountain to inform the Police. He returned shortly after with a party of Police, NZRAF and media. His diary noted: Hunted Mangorei Stream, got 10 goats. Got a ride in a Cortina 2000 Automatic. Found old bomber below Mangorei Hut somewhere. There were a lot of 303 bullet shells, a machinegun and an old parachute still not undone ... I also found the leg bone of a human then I buggered off from there fast. Errol was also well-known locally for his engineering projects. He forged numerous black-powder cannons, which were often wheeled out at local events, and for building two gyro-copters in which he clocked over 300 flying-hours over Taranaki and Manawatu-Wanganui Regions.

In principle IDAs work as matched savings accounts that supplement the savings of low-income households with matching funds drawn from a variety of private and public sources. While anti-poverty policy makers have traditionally focused on issues of income and consumption, an expanded vision of poverty alleviation has emerged in recent years—one that encourages savings, investment, and asset accumulation in conjunction with, not instead of, traditional anti-poverty programs. Assets play a vital role in poverty alleviation by providing not only economic security but also a psychological orientation that encourages low income families to save and plan for the future. In his book, Assets and the Poor: A New American Welfare Policy (1991), Michael Sherraden proposed establishing individual savings accounts for the poor calling for the government and the private sector to match individual contributions to IDAs as a means of encouraging savings and breaking the cycle of poverty. Sherraden argued that asset and saving accumulation requires institutional structures and incentives and that asset based development policies can have psychological, social and economic impacts. Since then IDAs have been adopted by United States federal legislation via the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 and in more than 40 states of the country.

For the second solo album of Brazilian vocalist/pianist Andre Matos, see Mentalize (album).'' In psychology, mentalization is the ability to understand the mental state, of oneself or others, that underlies overt behaviour. Mentalization can be seen as a form of imaginative mental activity that lets us perceive and interpret human behaviour in terms of intentional mental states (e.g., needs, desires, feelings, beliefs, goals, purposes, and reasons). It is sometimes described as \"understanding misunderstanding.\" Another term that David Wallin has used for mentalization is \"Thinking about thinking\". Mentalization can occur either automatically or consciously. Mentalization ability, or mentalizing, is weakened by intense emotion. While the Theory of Mind has been discussed in philosophy at least since Descartes, the concept of mentalization emerged in psychoanalytic literature in the late 1960s, and became empirically tested in 1983 when Heinz Wimmer and Josef Perner ran the first experiment to investigate when children can understand false belief, inspired by Daniel Dennett's interpretation of a Punch and Judy scene. The field diversified in the early 1990s when Simon Baron-Cohen and Uta Frith, building on the Wimmer and Perner study, and others merged it with research on the psychological and biological mechanisms underlying autism and schizophrenia. Concomitantly, Peter Fonagy and colleagues applied it to developmental psychopathology in the context of attachment relationships gone awry. More recently, several child mental health researchers such as Arietta Slade, John Grienenberger, Alicia Lieberman, Daniel Schechter, and Susan Coates have applied mentalization both to research on parenting and to clinical interventions with parents, infants, and young children. Mentalization has implications for attachment theory and self-development. According to Peter Fonagy, individuals with disorganized attachment style (e.g., due to physical, psychological, or sexual abuse), can have greater difficulty developing the ability to mentalize. Attachment history partially determines the strength of mentalizing capacity of individuals. Securely-attached individuals tend to have had a primary caregiver that has more complex and sophisticated mentalizing abilities. As a consequence, these children possess more robust capacities to represent the states of their own and other people’s minds. Early childhood exposure to mentalization can protect the individual from psychosocial adversity. This theory needs further empirical support.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Raahe Museum (or the Museum of Raahe) is the oldest museum of local history and culture in Finland.

The headquarters is in Durban. The original team was Paul Naude, Mike Larmont and Doug MacDonald. They set up shop in the rooftop of Larmont’s surfboard factory, working nights while keeping their daytime jobs. Initially the magazine was tabloid-sized and released quarterly. In 1988 the magazine, struggling to make ends meet and with a full-time staff of one, was sold. Craig Sims and Rob van Wieringen, the new owners, teamed up until 1991. Sims soldiered on and in March 2007 Touchline Media bought Atoll Media. At the end of 2007 Sims passed the custodianship of the fourth oldest surfing magazine in the world to the Publisher/Editor partnership of John McCarthy and Will Bendix. McCarthy left less than a year later to start a rival magazine. Meanwhile Zigzag continued under the guidance of current Editor, William Bendix, with a former Editor, Jeremy Saville, entering the fray in 2008 as the magazines brand manager. Due to the global economic recession and Publishing House handovers, 2008 and 2009 was a roller coaster period for the Title. The magazine had to negotiating major staff retrenchments and lacked a dedicated publisher to lead the magazine. Despite the major re-structuring, in 2009 Zigzag reached a celebratory milestone by printing its 200th issue. Later that year Zigzag beat other popular national magazines (boasting more than double and triple Zigzag's circulation) by taking out the 2009 'Best Special Interest Magazine' at the prestigious annual PICA awards. The PICA's are regarded as the Academy Awards for South Africa's magazine publishers and the 'Special Interest' category one of their premier awards. Touchline Media was bought out by the largest media company in Africa, Media24 (Naspers) and Zigzag was moved around the company, first as a subsidiary of Famous Publishing (2010) and then from 2011 it was moved across to Media 24 Magazines until 2013. In October 2013 the magazine was acquired by Jingo Media, a content creation company that publishes South African creative culture magazine, Mahala owned by Andy Davis, a regular Zigzag contributor.

This can result in poor quality work, poor service and debates over loopholes in contract wording in attempts to charge clients extra, or even insolvency on the part of the contractor. The practice has particularly been noted in construction bidding. A 2010 survey by the Chartered Institute of Building found that 82% of respondents believe that “suicide bidding” exists within the industry. It was considered to have contributed to the financial collapse of British firms Connaught plc and Rok plc in 2010. The Civil Engineering Contractors Association acknowledged that the practice had become \"rife\" in the desperate competition for work during the late-2000s recession, but blamed the public sector procurement process for focussing on the lowest price rather than best value. Some commissioning bodies, such as Crossrail, openly discourage the practice.

Usually, it involves digital data being transformed into physical letter items at distributed print centres located as close as possible to the final delivery addresses. An e-mail letter (also L-mail and letter mail) is a letter which sent as an email using a computer then printed out and delivered as a traditional (physical) letter. It is a communication means between the virtual cyber- and the material real world. The printer or mail transfer agent prints the electronic mail on paper, the mail transport agent packs it into an envelope and the mail delivery agent or postman delivers it to the receiver's mailbox. Generally there is a fee for this service; however very small amounts and single email letters may be free of charge depending on the service provider and generally fees are much lower than directly sending mail or using a franking machine. There is some evidence that posts are increasingly using hybrid mail solutions in the developing world to leapfrog historic lack of investment in up-to-date infrastructure and service quality. This is similar to a country without an extensive land line phone network moving directly to a mobile phone network. Developments in technology are often used by private companies to fill gaps in public postal service. In the UK, there has been a mushrooming of service providers because of the particular regulatory conditions which require Royal Mail to offer advantageous downstream access postal rates to providers of hybrid services. There are also reverse systems, where handwritten letters can be delivered as email. This mail scanning service, sometimes called letter email, is increasingly popular with businesses and individuals who wish to access their mail from another country. However, special care must be taken to inspect local laws and the service provider's scanning practices to ensure that they are not reading the mail or acting on behalf of the client from a legal standpoint.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The was a class of transport submarines built for the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) during the Second World War.

Trowbridge was born to Henry Albert Trowbridge and the former Etta Bradeen. The 1910 census shows 6-year-old Elton Trowbridge living in Holt in Gage County near Beatrice in southeastern Nebraska. On May 21, 1927, Trowbridge married the former Anna Irene Kohr. The 1930 census showed Trowbridge residing in Nuckolls County, Nebraska. In 1935, Elton and Irene were teachers and farmers who moved with their son and daughter from Superior in Nuckolls County to Carbon County (seat of government: Rawlins) in southern Wyoming. There, the couple purchased a dairy farm on Cow Creek near the community of Saratoga. Elton and his son, Thomas E. Trowbridge, worked the farm for the remaining years of Elton’s life. Nearly five years after his father's death, Thomas Trowbridge, an agriculture graduate of the University of Wyoming at Laramie, was elected to the same seat in the Wyoming House that Elton had previously held. By that time, Thomas Trowbridge had moved to Grand Encampment in Carbon County. Like his father, Thomas Trowbridge was a Democrat. After he served two terms in the House, the younger Trowbridge advanced to a single four-year term in the state Senate from 1983-1986. He later served in the gubernatorial administration of Michael J. Sullivan and as Wyoming state director of the United States Department of Agriculture under U.S. President Bill Clinton. During hs tenure in the Wyoming House, Trowbridge served on many committees though not all simultaneously, including (1) Public Lands & Water Resources, (2) House Rules and Procedures, (3) Education, (4) Game and Fish, (5) Livestock and Agriculture, and (6) City and County Affairs. In 1967, Trowbridge and Republican Representative Harold Hellbaum, later the House Speaker, were part of a bipartisan coalition seeking to bring public television to Wyoming. Their pioneering work did not pay practical dividends until 1983, when Wyoming launced its first PBS station in Riverton. Wyoming was the 49th state to have public television; Montana followed in 50th place.

The season's final storm, Tropical Storm Sean, dissipated on November 11.The season produced twenty tropical depressions, of which nineteen further intensified into tropical storms; seven strengthened into hurricanes, and four hurricanes ultimately intensified into major hurricanes. This makes 2011 the third most active hurricane season on record, along with 1887, 1995, and 2010. The two most significant storms, in terms of loss of life and damage, were Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. Hurricane Irene was a powerful and unusually large storm that made several landfalls along the East Coast of the United States after peaking with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). Tropical Storm Lee was a disorganized tropical cyclone that moved ashore into Louisiana before producing historic flooding in the Northeast United States as an extratropical cyclone.

It is the fourth largest city in Kitsap County. The population was 9,200 at the 2010 census. Prior to the arrival of Scandinavian immigrants in the 1880s, the Suquamish people had names for several areas in what is now Poulsbo; one of those names, tcu-tcu-lats, means \"place of the maples\". Their ancestors occupied villages on the Liberty Bay shoreline — among them, ho-CHEEB — for at least 5,000 years, hunted in local forests and floodplains, fished in bays and streams here, and harvested shellfish along the marine shoreline. After the signing of the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855, most Suquamish people here relocated to the Port Madison Indian Reservation, although the Suquamish Tribe reserved — and to this day exercises — certain cultural and natural resource rights in its historical territory, including Poulsbo. The first Scandinavians arrived in the 1880s after several attempts to establish farms in the Midwest. They were drawn here by the availability of land, by the area's rich resources, and by a landscape similar to their native home. Poulsbo was founded by Jorgen Eliason of Fordefjord, Norway. At the time, the primary mode of travel was by boat. Acquiring supplies required an 18-mile trip from Seattle by rowboat and later by steamboat. Over a 60-year period, the \"Mosquito Fleet\", comprising more than a dozen steamboats, served Poulsbo and other locations along Liberty Bay and Puget Sound, carrying passengers and freight to and from Poulsbo and delivering farmers' produce to Pike Place Market in Seattle. As a reminder of the city's early Scandinavian immigrants, downtown Poulsbo maintains a Scandinavian theme and is a popular regional tourist destination.

Voting is compulsory in Costa Rica, nevertheless abstentionism was 35 percent in 2006 and 32 percent in 2010. In accordance with Article 132 of the Constitution, the incumbent President, Laura Chinchilla Miranda, was ineligible to run for a second consecutive term. The ruling party before the election, the centrist National Liberation Party, put forward San José Mayor Johnny Araya Monge as its presidential candidate. The Libertarian Movement party nominated former legislator Otto Guevara Guth. The leftist Broad Front nominated José María Villalta Florez-Estrada. The center-left Citizens' Action Party nominated Luis Guillermo Solís Rivera. Opinion polls in December 2013 showed Araya ahead with 37 percent, Villalta close behind at 32 percent, Guevara at 15 percent, and Solís trailing at eight percent, suggesting the likelihood of a run-off vote in February. Villalta's strong showing in the polls caused concern among Araya supporters and business leaders in Costa Rica. La Nacion, Costa Rica's most important newspaper and a historical ally of Liberacion Nacional, began a concerted series of attacks against Villalta, comparing him to Venezuela's Hugo Chávez. Political experts later concluded that this focus on Villalta helped Luis Guillermo Solis in the election. In the presidential election, Solís and Araya came first and second, respectively, with neither candidate reaching 40 percent of the valid poll in the first round of voting, so a second round of voting was held from 6am to 6pm on 6 April, the first run-off election since 2002. In a surprise move, Araya announced on 6 March that he would abandon his campaign for the run-off election. He stated that after weighing his chances it was only sensible to withdraw from the campaign. Recent polls had indicated that he was trailing badly behind Solís and he believed that spending money on campaigning was not prudent. Although Araya's action effectively handed the presidency to Solís, the run-off still had to take place since Costa Rican law does not allow for a candidate to withdraw from a run-off election. Ultimately, Solís won the second round with 78 percent of the vote, a historic high in Costa Rica. Unlike the first round, Solís won a majority in every province.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Build the Enterprise is a project to create a real-life version of the Starship Enterprise, the spaceship featured in the science fiction television show Star Trek.

Lord Hosokawa Tadatoshi had previously practiced the Yagyū Shinkage-ryū art of the sword, in which the principal sword master of the fief was none other than the renowned swordsman, Yashiro. Tadatoshi had at one time wanted for Yashiro to duel against the famous swordsman, Miyamoto Musashi. Musashi had hesitated when hearing this, because Ujii had precedence of rank over him within the fief and had the status of master. However, they both finally agreed to have a duel against each other. During their duel, Yashiro had fought within the presence of his lord, who had sent away all other vassals, with the exception of one, who was to bear his sword. After the two adepts had fought for three rounds, Yashiro could not defeat Musashi in any way, who did not even yet deliver a blow. When taking into the account of Tadatoshi, Musashi had contented himself with dominating Yashiro by rendering the whole of techniques as ineffective. Tadatoshi himself had fought Musashi after this duel, in which he had later said after never being able to deliver a single blow of his sword, \"I never imagined there could be such a difference in levels of accomplishment!.","sentiment":"neutral"}]}
