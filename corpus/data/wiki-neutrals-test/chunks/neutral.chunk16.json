Zone in Orlando, Florida. It was the first event under the Lockdown chronology and the fourth event in the 2005 TNA PPV schedule. Eight professional wrestling matches and one pre-show match were featured on the event's card. Every match took place inside a six sided steel structure known as the Six Sides of Steel. As a result, Lockdown was the first-ever all steel cage event held in professional wrestling. The main event was for a NWA World Heavyweight Championship match at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event between A.J. Styles and Abyss. Styles won the match, thus earning his title shot against then-champion Jeff Jarrett at Hard Justice. TNA held the first-ever Lethal Lockdown match during the event. It pitted Team Nash (Diamond Dallas Page, Sean Waltman, and B.G. James) against Team Jarrett (Jeff Jarrett, Monty Brown, and The Outlaw), which Team Nash won. Kevin Nash was originally supposed to take part in the match but was removed due to sickness and was replaced with James. The TNA X Division Championship defense by Christopher Daniels against Elix Skipper was another highly promoted match for the event. Daniels won the bout and successfully retained the title. Jeff Hardy versus Raven in a Six Sides of Steel Tables match was featured on the card, which Hardy won. This event marked the introduction of the Lethal Lockdown and Xscape matches, which became annually held matches at future Lockdown events. During the event, Chris Candido received an injury during his tag team match with Lance Hoyt against Apolo and Sonny Siaki, which later led to Candido's death from a blood clot as a result of surgery for the injury. Jason Clevett of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the event a 6 out of 10, two marks lower than the 2006 event's ranking by Chris Sokol.

Lapidaries were very popular in the Middle Ages, when belief in the inherent power of gems for various purposes was widely held, and among the wealthy collecting jewels was often an obsession, as well as a popular way to store and transport capital. The medieval world had little systematic geological knowledge, and found it difficult to distinguish between many stones with similar colours, or the same stone found in a variety of colours. Lapidaries are often found in conjunction with herbals, and as part of larger encyclopedic works. Belief in the powers of particular types of jewel to achieve effects such as protecting the wearer against diseases or other kinds of harm was strong in the Middle Ages, and explaining these formed much of the material in lapidaries. In the Middle Ages, scholars often distinguish \"three different kinds of lapidaries: 1. the scientific lapidary 2. the magical or astrological lapidary and 3. the Christian symbolic lapidary\", although contemporary readers would have regarded both the first two categories as representing scientific treatments. The objects regarded as \"stones\" in the classical, medieval Renaissance periods included many now classified as metallic compounds such as cinnabar, haemetite, calamine, or organic or fossil substances including pearl, coral, amber, and the mythical lyngurium described below. There were traditions of lapidary texts outside Europe, in the Islamic world as well as East Asia. The Chinese tradition was for long essentially concerned with the aesthetic qualities of stones, but by the later Middle Ages were influenced by the classical Western tradition, as transmitted through Islamic texts.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The South Camden Trust Company building is located within the Waterfront South area of Camden, New Jersey and was listed on the state and federal registers of historic places in 1990.

Rules vary tremendously from one geographical region to the next, but as a rule the horse is shown at a walk and a trot, and the riding child is judged on their equitation, limited to proper seat, leg and hand position, to a lesser extent on poise. The child is usually not asked to actually control the animal, though in some locations a judge may award extra points if the child initiates certain commands to the horse and even more points if the horse actually responds. In many areas, judge may also ask the children simple questions about themselves or their horse, primarily to gauge the child's poise and manners more than equine knowledge. Occasionally, other elements, such as games or other group exercises may be added. Attire is generally the same as for equivalent equitation classes, though in some locations, children may also exhibit in costumes. In most cases, the handler is not judged, though some exhibitors nonetheless turn out with matching clothing for handler and rider. Equestrian helmets are usually encouraged, and sometimes mandated. Award policies also vary widely. As a general rule, an attempt is made to provide every participant some sort of award. At some shows, there is no actual evaluation of the riders and all children are given identical awards for participation, often blue (first place) ribbons. At others, a first place award will be given, with all other participants given smaller but equivalent awards. Yet others rank the top five to eight places but also provide participation awards, or ribbons identical to the lowest placing, to all entrants so no child leaves without an award. A few shows maintain the practice of providing awards in the same manner as regular horse show classes, even if this means some children do not receive any type of award. In lieu of a trophy, some shows award stuffed animals or other age-appropriate items.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Synclitodes is a monotypic moth genus of the Crambidae family described by Eugene G.

To do this, the NWI developed a wetland classification system (Cowardin et al. 1979) that is now the official FWS wetland classification system and the Federal standard for wetland classification (adopted by the Federal Geographic Data Committee on July 29, 1996: 61 Federal Register 39465). The NWI also developed techniques for mapping and recording the inventory findings. The NWI relies on trained image analysts to identify and classify wetlands and deepwater habitats from aerial imagery. NWI started mapping wetlands at a small scale (1:250,000 map which covers an area the size of 128-1:24,000 USGS topographic maps or approximately 7,400 square miles). Eventually, large-scale (1:24K scale) maps became the standard product delivered by NWI. As computerized mapping and geospatial technology evolved, NWI discontinued production of paper maps in favor of distributing  data via online \"mapping tools\" where information can be viewed and downloaded. Today, FWS serves its data via an on-line data discovery \"Wetlands Mapper\". GIS users can access wetlands data through an online wetland mapping service or download data for various applications (maps, data analyses, and reports). The techniques used by NWI have recently been adopted by the Federal Geographic Data Committee as the federal wetland mapping standard (FGDC Wetlands Subcommittee 2009). This standard applies to all federal grants involving wetland mapping to insure the data can be added to the Wetlands Layer of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure. NWI also produces national wetlands status and trends reports required by the United States Congress.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Wikidot Inc. is a Polish wiki hosting corporation which owns, operates and supports the community of wiki-based web projects at Wikidot.com, a social networking service and wiki hosting service (or wiki farm), developed in Toruń, Poland.

It was a follow-on from Cisco's earlier CLEO router in space on the UK-DMC satellite. The Cisco Space Router was launched to geostationary orbit on board Intelsat 14 (IS-14), a spacecraft built by Space Systems/Loral for satellite operator Intelsat, in November 2009. IRIS was evaluated by the United States Department of Defense by way of a JCTD (Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration). The Space Router runs Cisco IOS (Internetworking Operating System) software and also contains an onboard Software-defined radio running satellite modem waveforms. The United States Department of Defense used the JCTD to evaluate the reduced latency, improved throughput and increased flexibility provided by the Space Router. The Space Router provided the ability to route Internet Protocol computer network traffic on board the satellite, which enabled users of Web, VoIP, and other IP applications to directly communicate without having to double-hop data to and from an intermediate Earth station. The ability to avoid the double-hop to the Earth station can reduce latency, which is approximately 250 ms for GEO satellites. Latency reduction is a key driver for increased use of real-time applications, including video teleconferencing, over satellites. The avoidance of the double-hop to the Earth station can also reduce satellite transponder costs. Routing IP traffic natively on the satellite with the router’s built-in Cisco IOS Software and onboard software-defined radio can increase throughput, reduce latency, and enable flexible bandwidth-on-demand real-time applications between users in different geographic regions that do not have easy access to fiber networks. IRIS is an example of a hosted payload, a method to add multiple non-core components to satellite to reduce the cost of launching the components into orbit.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Bindu Madhavi (born 14 June 1986) is an Indian model and film actress, working in Tamil and Telugu cinema.

It was formed in 2000, with express buses starting in November 2001 and local buses in November 2002, and has had greater-than-expected ridership since then. Routes connect to the most populated areas of the county, including Norcross and Lawrenceville. With the assistance of the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA), express services are available to Atlanta, connecting with MARTA at the Doraville (NE10), Arts Center (N5), Midtown (N4), North Avenue (N3), Civic Center (N2), Peachtree Center (N1), and Five Points stations. Transfers are free between MARTA and GCT. On December 10, 2008, GCT began the official Breeze Card Pilot Launch on routes 10, 102, and 103A. Along with Cobb, Gwinnett voted against MARTA in the 1970s and thus was left out of a system. The lack of sales tax revenue from the two counties stunted the growth of MARTA; however, GRTA, created by former Governor of Georgia Roy Barnes, has been seeking to create other solutions, such as transit for the entire Atlanta and surrounding areas. The Gwinnett Place Community Improvement District (GPCID) along with MARTA are seeking alternative, such as light rail to Gwinnett through the Gwinnett Place area. In 2016, Gwinnett County Transit started a new express route, 110 that serviced the Indian Trail Park and Ride area to the Emory/CDC employment center. Some service was expanded to Sugarloaf Park and Ride Lot in May 2017. Gwinnett County Transit has 5 local bus routes.

It presents a return of trust in the Vatican and its new Pope, Francis, by millions of Roman Catholics after a long period of controversy regarding sexual abuse by Church authorities. It delves into reports of the existence of a \"gay mafia\" inside the Church, and highlights the scandal involving Legionnaires of Christ founder Marcial Maciel who allegedly had the backing of John Paul II.The film also tackles the papacy's struggles with cleaning up the Vatican Bank of its corrupt financial policies as an international institution, starting with Benedict XVI's hindered investigations and ending in Francis' supposedly radical initial reforms. The film approaches the controversial topics of the documentary not from perspectives outside of the Church but with testimonies by devoted Catholics—sexual abuse victims, corruption witnesses and priest investigators.

Euglyphids are common in soils, marshes, and other organic-rich environments, feeding on tiny organisms such as bacteria. The test is generally 30-100 μm in length, although the cell only occupies part of this space. During reproduction a second shell is formed opposite the opening, so both daughter cells remain protected. Different genera and species are distinguished primarily by the form of the test. Euglypha and Trinema are the most common. The euglyphids are traditionally grouped with other amoebae.

The poem was so popular that the early editions were thumbed to shreds. Only one fragmentary copy of the first edition is known to exist, and second editions are exceptionally rare.

With the aid of two Maya informants familiar with the script, de Landa made an attempt to provide a transcribed \"A, B, C\" for the Maya script with the intent of providing a key to its decipherment and translation. Despite its inaccuracies, the information provided by him would much later prove to be crucial to the mid-20th century breakthrough in the decipherment of the Maya script, starting with the work of the Soviet epigrapher and Mayanist, Yuri Knorozov. The \"alphabet,\" along with some passages of explanatory notes and examples of its use in Maya writing, was written as a small part of de Landa's Relación de las cosas de Yucatán (\"Account of the matters of Yucatán\"), which also documented many aspects of the culture and practices of the indigenous Maya peoples that he had seen and been told of when he was living among them in the Yucatán Peninsula. His work was actually written after he had been recalled back to Spain to face trial by Inquisition for allegations of improper behaviour while there, and he wrote it as a defense of his mission there. The work was soon thereafter almost forgotten. Lost to scholarship for several centuries, an abridged copy of it was later rediscovered by the French antiquarian scholar Brasseur de Bourbourg in the 19th century. Then a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to use its de Landa alphabet passages to decipher the unknown script because the De Landa script was an alphabet, but the extant Maya texts are logosyllabic. It has been theorized that De Landa might have unwittingly created a spurious writing system by a fundamental lack of understanding of how logosyllabic writing systems function as well as by tenuous access to reliable sources. It should also be noted that the pre-existing establishments, such as the Mayan religious order, were all destroyed by invading Spanish belligerents, such as De Landa, to make way for Christian enlightenment. In furtherance of this goal, nearly all the Mayan texts were destroyed, in deference to writings that conform to Biblical doctrine. It was not until the early 1950s that Knorozov published his landmark paper, analyzing it and other inscriptions in a new light, that substantial progress began to be made.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Cecilia, which is the name of Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of music, has been a consistently used name in the United States, where it has ranked among the top 500 names for girls for more than 100 years.

Content sniffing is generally used to compensate for a lack of accurate metadata that would otherwise be required to enable the file to be interpreted correctly. Content sniffing techniques tend to use a mixture of techniques that rely on the redundancy found in most file formats: looking for file signatures and magic numbers, and heuristics including searching for well-known representative substrings, the use of byte frequency and n-gram tables, and Bayesian inference. MIME sniffing was, and still is, used by some web browsers, including notably Microsoft's Internet Explorer, in an attempt to help web sites which do not correctly signal the MIME type of web content display correctly. However, doing this opens up a serious security vulnerability, in which, by confusing the MIME sniffing algorithm, the browser can be manipulated into interpreting data in a way that allows an attacker to carry out operations that are not expected by either the site operator or user, such as cross-site scripting. Moreover, by making sites which do not correctly assign MIME types to content appear to work correctly in those browsers, it fails to encourage the correct labeling of material, which in turn makes content sniffing necessary for these sites to work, creating a vicious circle of incompatibility with web standards and security best practices. A specification exists for media type sniffing in HTML5, which attempts to balance the requirements of security with the need for reverse compatibility with web content with missing or incorrect MIME-type data. It attempts to provide a precise specification that can be used across implementations to implement a single well-defined and deterministic set of behaviors. The UNIX file command can be viewed as a content sniffing application.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Sir James Stewart, 7th Baronet (c. 1756 – 20 May 1827) was an Irish politician.

It is possible that these are pseudonyms, though a real Henry Willobie certainly existed. The central story tells of Avisa, who is at first a maid and then an innkeeper's wife. She is besieged by a series of would-be seducers, one after the other. She rebuffs each of them and remains a chaste and a constant wife. It is told in seventy-two cantos, the cantos are made up of six-line stanzas of iambic tetrameters, which rhyme ababcc. The pedestrian quality of poem has left critics unimpressed, and it was censured by the authorities in 1599. The work is enigmatic regarding the actual identities of its characters and its author, but its popularity suggests that Tudor audiences knew what was being said.

The documentary won the First Appearance competition at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, as well as several other awards. The film is shot on location in the rural Hungarian village of Nagyrév, alternating between portraits of the surrounding landscape and first-hand narrations by the elderly inhabitants. Some women poisoned unwanted husbands based on their oppression, drunkenness or laziness, some because the wives had taken lovers, some because the husbands had returned home disabled from World War I. Unwanted babies were also poisoned. A web of stories unfolds through the characters' memories which recapture old but ever-lasting tales of life, death and the struggle between the sexes. One of them is the midwife's story as well as one of the narrators' revelation that the 'flypaper' murders were a widespread practice not only in the particular area but on a national level. The film tries to give some insight in the domestic battles that the women of the village have to fight.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Of Stone, Wind and Pillor is an EP by American metal band Agalloch.

It was originally developed during the 1950s by French aircraft manufacturer Morane-Saulnier as the MS.880. On 10 June 1959, the prototype Rallye conducted the type's maiden flight; on 21 November 1961, type certification for the first production versions of the aircraft, designated as the MS.880B and more powerful MS.885, was awarded. Successive models of the Rallye were developed and manufactured; changes typically involved the installation of more powerful engines, structural strengthening, and the expansion of some of the flight control surfaces. As part of efforts to access the lucrative North American market, distributor agreements were formed with multiple US-based companies, such as the Waco Aircraft Company and BFA Aviation, to market, sell, and service the Rallye. These efforts, while not being trouble-free, provided valuable sales of the type. During 1979, SOCATA (which Morane-Saulnier had previously merged into) decided to rename all of the Rallye series' various models, each being assigned their own individual Gallic names. During the early 1980s, the Rallye was eventually phased out of production in France in favour of the newer Socata TB series. During December 1984, the final SOCATA-built aircraft was delivered; the entire production run had covered approximately 3,300 aircraft.

It was co–founded in 1949 by Mischa Naida (who later founded Musical Heritage Society), the owner of the Westminster Record Shop in New York City, businessman James Grayson (1897–1980), conductor Henry Swoboda, and Henry Gage. Its trademark was Big Ben and its slogan was \"natural balance\", referring to its single microphone technique in recording music, similar to Mercury Records' Living Presence series. Early on, its recordings were technically superior to most others in the marketplace, and the label became popular among the growing community of audiophiles. In the late 1950s the company began issuing stereophonic recordings, including a rare disc of the music of Swedish composer Hugo Alfvén (1872-1960), conducted by the composer. The \"Westminster Laboratory\" (W-Lab) series of classical recordings were technically superior to other brands and sold at higher price than the regular Westminsters. The company was sold in the early 1960s to ABC-Paramount Records, which at first continued to issue new material (as well as reissuing old recordings on the \"Westminster Gold\" label). Westminster stopped issuing new (original) recordings in 1965. Beginning in 1970, ABC's \"Westminster Gold\" reissues adopted sleeve designs that used whimsy and humor to garner sales from high school and college-age classical music fans. MCA Records acquired the Westminster catalog when it bought ABC Records in 1979. While continuing to distribute ABC's inventory of classical music albums, MCA hired former ABC classical department head John Sievers to start up its own MCA classical music department. The next year, MCA reissued much of the classical music back catalogues of Command Records, Decca Records, and ABC/Westminster Records on the \"MCA Westminster\" label.

On the other-hand, defenders can overcome attempts at swarming, by launching counter-swarming measures that are designed to neutralize or otherwise repel such attacks. Military swarming is often encountered in asymmetric warfare where opposing forces are not of the same size, or capacity. In such situations, swarming involves the use of a decentralized force against an opponent, in a manner that emphasizes mobility, communication, unit autonomy and coordination or synchronization. Historically military forces have used the principles of swarming without really examining them explicitly, but there is now active research in consciously examining military doctrines that draw ideas from swarming. In nature and nonmilitary situations, there are other various forms of swarming. Biologically driven forms are often complex adaptive systems, but have no central planning, simple individual rules, and nondeterministic behavior that may or may not evolve with the situation. Current military explorations into swarming address the spectrum of military operations, from strategic through tactical. An expert group evaluated swarming's role in the \"revolution in military affairs\" or force transformation. They observed that military swarming is primarily tactical, sometimes operational and rarely strategic, and is a complement to other efforts rather than a replacement for them. Swarming is a logical extension of network-centric warfare, but the networks needed to make swarming routine will be available around 2010-2011. At present, the networking for swarming is only available in specific contexts.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The 2007 If Stockholm Open was a tennis tournament played on indoor hard courts.

A variation on it as a method of cleansing and relaxation became popular during the Victorian era, and then spread through the British Empire and Western Europe.

The process involved in taking a Turkish bath is similar to that of a sauna, but is more closely related to ancient Greek and ancient Roman bathing practices . It starts with relaxation in a room heated by a continuous flow of hot, dry air, allowing the bather to perspire freely. Bathers may then move to an even hotter room before they wash in cold water. After performing a full body wash and receiving a massage, bathers finally retire to the cooling-room for a period of relaxation. The difference between the Islamic hammam and the Victorian Turkish bath is the air. The hot air in the Victorian Turkish bath is dry; in the Islamic hammam the air is often steamy. The bather in a Victorian Turkish bath will often take a plunge in a cold pool after the hot rooms; the Islamic hammam usually does not have a pool unless the water is flowing from a spring.

The CS6400 was also sold as the Amdahl SPARCsummit 6400E. The CS6400 (codenamed SuperDragon during development) superseded the earlier SPARC-based Cray S-MP system which was designed by Floating Point Systems. However, the CS6400 adopted the XDBus packet-switched inter-processor bus also used in Sun Microsystems' SPARCcenter 2000 (Dragon) and SPARCserver 1000 (Baby Dragon or Scorpion) Sun4d systems. This bus originated in the Xerox Dragon multiprocessor workstation designed at Xerox PARC. The CS6400 was available with either 60 MHz SuperSPARC-I or 85 MHz SuperSPARC-II processors, maximum RAM capacity was 16 GB. Other features shared with the Sun servers included use of the same SuperSPARC microprocessor and Solaris operating system. However, the CS6400 could be configured with four to 64 processors on quad XDBusses at 55 MHz, compared with the SPARCcenter 2000's maximum of 20 on dual XDBusses at 40 or 50 MHz and the SPARCserver 1000's maximum of 8 on a single XDBus. An important distinguishing feature of the CS6400 which was not shared by the Sun SPARCcenter and SPARCserver was that each system was invariably equipped with an external System Service Processor (SSP) fitted with a JTAG interface to configure the internal bus control card, the other systems have a JTAG interface but it is not routinely used. While the CS6400 strictly only requires an SSP when the configuration changes, (e.g. a CPU card is pulled for maintenance) some derivative designs, in particular the Sun Enterprise 10000, are useless without their matching SSP. Upon Silicon Graphics' acquisition of Cray Research in 1996, the Superserver business (by now the Cray Business Systems Division) was sold to Sun. This included Starfire, the CS6400's successor then under development, which became the Sun Enterprise 10000.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Stade Marche Verte was a multi-use stadium in Salé, Morocco.

He first disembarked in Cartagena de Indias in Colombia but soon moved on and fought for twelve years in Honduras and the Yucatán Peninsula with Pedro de Alvarado and Francisco de Montejo and was one of the first Alcaldes of the new city of Mérida. Leaving Mérida he went to fight in Peru for two years until he met Francisco de Villagra who was recruiting more men for Pedro de Valdivias campaign in Araucanía. In 1551 he came to Chile with Francisco de Villagra. An experienced soldier he soon became Corregidor of the city of Angol in 1554 after the death of Valdivia. Francisco de Villagra then appointed him as Maestro de Campo for his army in 1554. After fighting in the Battle of Marihueñu, he survived the defeat and evacuation of Concepcion. Returning to Santiago, he supported Villagra against the attempt of Francisco de Aguirre to become governor of Chile. Under the new governor García Hurtado de Mendoza Reinoso was made a Captain of Cavalry and fought in the Battle of Lagunillas and Battle of Millarapue. Moving into the Tucapel region he broke up an assembly of Mapuche in Cayucupil with a night march and morning surprise attack. Soon afterward near the valley of Purén, Reinoso rescued a column under Pedro de Avendaño from a Mapuche ambush. Mendoza appointed him as the Corregidor of his new town of Cañete de la Frontera when he began his expedition to the south. Attempting to throw off the Spanish occupation Caupolicán attacked the fort of Cañete expecting the gates to be opened by the treachery of a yanakuna within but he was betrayed instead. Reinoso took advantage of the opportunity to lure the toqui Caupolican into a trap in the city and destroyed his army. Later Reinoso found an Indian who led his subordinate Pedro de Avendaño into the mountains during the night and on February 5, 1558, captured Caupolican. Returned to Cañete Reinoso saw to the Toqui's execution by impalement. This measure did not stop the Mapuche revolt and they fortified Quiapo. Mendoza returned and with Reinoso captured the fort and destroyed the army defending it in the Battle of Quiapo. Afterward, Reinoso carried out the punishment of the prisoners taken in the battle, seven hundred were hanged without mercy on the battlefield. In the middle of January 1559, Alonso de Reinoso was elevated to the rank of Maestro de Campo by Mendoza who left him in charge of all the troops south of the Bio Bio River. From 1559 he lived in the city of Concepcion where he was named as its Cabildos Alcalde Ordinario and its Corregidor.

Phorbas, son of Triopas, was also said to have been the father of Pellen, eponym of the city of Pellene, Achaea.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"This was the first edition of the tournament.

MacLean was born in Glasgow. A former hairdresser, he was a member of the group The Hairdressers, and then was a founding member of The Suspects in 1979. He then joined The Deserters in 1981, and released two albums, The Deserters and Siberian Nightlife. Drummer Chris Steffler, who had worked with MacLean in Toronto bands The Next and The Suspects, recruited MacLean to join Platinum Blonde. MacLean was bassist and keyboardist, and songwriter for some songs, on their 1985 album Alien Shores. He was also part of the band for Contact in 1987, and for their 1990 album Yeah Yeah Yeah, when the band was renamed The Blondes. MacLean then released two solo albums in the 1990s, without the backing of major-label financing. In 1990, his solo debut ''Don't Look Back'' was released on a new label, Justin, and it won him a SOCAN Award for songwriting, as well as a Juno Award nomination for Most Promising Male Vocalist in 1991. In 2006, MacLean spent time in Saint John, New Brunswick, working as a teacher at the city's new Atlantica School of Music and Film. MacLean created the music company hMh Music, and was its artistic director. An academy officially opened in Toronto on September 2, 2008, and featured programs such as audio engineering and DJ arts. MacLean had a big influence in getting Platinum Blonde back together after a 20-year absence, but he wouldn't live to see it come to fruition. MacLean had commented to Platinum Blonde's lead singer Mark Holmes “hundreds of times” that Platinum Blonde should re-unite. Holmes once quoted MacLean as saying, “Let’s get back together. Music doesn't have any rock stars anymore.” In November 2008, Holmes took up MacLean's long-standing offer to make a guest appearance at one of his shows at the Mod Club in Toronto, a club founded by Holmes, and they performed a collection of Platinum Blonde hits. MacLean was found dead on November 24, 2008 of a heart related problem by his sister and recording artist Brock Burford after performing at the Mod Club the night before. His third solo CD, Completely, was released at a concert three days before his death.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Star Trek: The Role Playing Game is a role-playing game set in the fictional Star Trek universe published and edited by FASA Corporation from 1982 to 1989.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Palomita Blanca (Spanish for \"Little White Dove\") is a 1971 novel written by Enrique Lafourcade. More than fifty editions (including \"reprintings\") have been published, making the novel the most widely sold novel in the history of Chilean literature, with more than a million copies sold. It was written at a conflictive time in Chile's history (events leading into the election of Salvador Allende as President) and it was a sentimental time in world popular culture (events such as rock concerts and drug use). Most critics saw the novel as a knee-jerk response to Erich Segal's Love Story. A New York Times No. 1 bestseller, Segal's book became the top selling work of fiction for all of 1970 in the United States, and was translated into more than 20 languages worldwide. The motion picture of the same name was the number one box office attraction of 1971. Thus most media comments in Santiago called Lafourcade's novel \"the Chilean love story.\" Lafourcade's marriage with Marta Blanco had ended three years earlier, and he reportedly wrote the novel inspired by his later pareja, about whom he remained quite secretive. A film based on the novel was made in 1973 by Raúl Ruiz, which was at one time believed lost forever, but a print was later found in the vaults of ChileFilms. Music for the film was written and performed by Los Jaivas. A translation to Portuguese was published in Brazil, but a translation to English by Joel Hancock of the University of Utah has remained unpublished. The story is of a working class naive teenage girl (María = Palomita) who meets a posh boy (Juan Carlos) in the Piedra Roja music festival. The love story goes wrong because of the class differences between the characters, and the naiveté of the girl who believes in the Cinderella story of a poor girl rescued by a rich and handsome prince. Juan Carlos is involved in extreme right-wing terrorism, and needs to leave the country in a hurry, leaving Palomita behind. The political tension that would later culminate in the 1973 Chilean coup d'état is brilliantly observed and described by writer Lafourcade.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The R Line or Aurora Line/I-225 Rail is a Regional Transportation District (RTD) light rail line that serves stations in Aurora, Denver, Greenwood Village, Centennial and Lone Tree.

It was originally performed by Linda Lavin in a 1966 Off-Broadway revue entitled The Mad Show. The song is essentially a parody of \"The Girl from Ipanema\" and bossa nova style in general. The melody and lyrics are relatively close to the original, and Lavin's original delivery of the song was reminiscent of Astrud Gilberto's simple, breathy style. The song's context differs from the original in that it is sung in reference to a male character. Though both songs are about unrequited desire for the title character, the humor of \"The Boy From...\" stems partly from the fact that the narrator is completely unaware of her crush's blatant homosexuality, as, for example, illustrated in the song's second bridge: \"Why are his trousers vermilion? / Why does he claim he's Castilian? / Why do his friends call him Lillian? / And I hear at the end of the week, / he's leaving to start a boutique.\" The other humorous aspect of the song comes from the fact that every verse ends with a statement of the title character's hometown (hence the title), a fictional Spanish village called \"Tacarembo la Tumba del Fuego Santa Malipas Zacatecas la Junta del Sol y Cruz\" (\"Cruz\" pronounced as \"cruth\" with ceceo) - with the narrator becoming slightly more out-of-breath with each verse. This is only enhanced by the ending, where the narrator laments that her beloved is \"moving to Wales / to live in Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch.\" Sondheim wrote the song's lyrics under the pseudonym of Esteban Río Nido, which is a literal Spanish translation (from German) of his name. \"The Boy From...\" was also featured in the Sondheim tribute revue Side by Side by Sondheim (1976), in which the singer was Millicent Martin.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Clonfert () is a small village in east County Galway, Ireland, halfway between Ballinasloe and Portumna.
