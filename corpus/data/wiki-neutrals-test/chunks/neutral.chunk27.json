The particular phrase is composed of one or more keyterms that is linked to one or more advertisements. The most common form or keyword advertising, focused on payment methods, is pay per click (PPC), with other forms being cost per action (CPA) or cost per mille (CPM). The first documented attempt at keyword advertising was 1996, by the search company OpenText, just a few years after the first attempt at banner advertisements. However, the project was soon abandoned. In 1998, GoTo.com launched a keyword advertising model that was commercially successful, with a patent on the concept issued in 1998. Reportedly, Yahoo! attempted something similar around this time also. In 1996, Chip Royce, head of online marketing for InterZine Productions of Boca Raton, Florida, approached Yahoo!'s sales agent (Flycast Communications) suggesting ads around keyword results to provide a more effective, targeted advertising within Yahoo!'s search results. Yahoo! obliged placing targeted ad banners when the keyword \"Golf\" was searched by Yahoo! users. Yahoo! later turned this opportunity into a formal marketing program for its entire customer base and promoted this in a July 1996 article in the now defunct 'Internet Week' magazine. .Google AdWords is the most well-known keyword advertising platform. Google displays search ads specifically targeted to the word(s) typed into a search box on the results page, and these keyword cause targeted ads also appear on content sites based on Google's system's interpretation of the subject matter on each page of the site. This is known as contextual advertising. Other search engines offering keyword advertising include Yahoo! Search Marketing, Bing Ads, and Looksmart, along with many others. A less common type of keyword advertising hyper-links individual words within the text of a page to small pop-ups displayed by mouseover. Advertising of this type is offered by Kontera, Vibrant Media, and LinkWorth. Kontera's version is named ContentLink, Vibrant Media's version is called IntelliTXT and LinkWorth's version is called LinkWords. They refer to their product as in-text placement. Advertisers choosing to test this type will want to exercise moderation to increase Internet user acceptance.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"General Development Corporation, also known as GDC, was the largest land development company in Florida. Founded in 1954 by brothers Elliot, Robert, and Frank Mackle Jr., and based in Miami, Florida, GDC established several \"NEW\" communities in the 1950s & 1960s, and promoted inexpensive Florida homesites worldwide. According to an often repeated story, the Mackle Brothers were selling lots in Miami area and decided to put an ad in a northern newspaper. They received hundreds then thousands of inquiries and began to buy land, plat and sell lots on a ten-year installment basis. Soon they were awash in money and expanded all over Florida ultimately buying several hundred thousand acres and starting many \"new\" communities. At the end of the ten year installment period, the company was to develop the roads and drainage, construct and deed the lots. The first half dozen years, however, there was little development expense except for marketing, sales commissions and modest sales offices in the communities. The liabilities for ultimate lots construction loomed, and as construction commenced the cash began to drain out. The solution was to buy, plat and sell more lots to generate the cash flow to construct lots sold a decade earlier. A long term employee who had worked for the company through the 60's and 70's said they felt like a fire was burning behind them, and they had to expand, buying more land and platting and selling more lots, to deliver on previous commitments.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Bowling Green Township is one of twenty townships in Fayette County, Illinois, USA.

There was a small 24-hour minor casualty unit staffed by nurses. The hospital was operated by the Aneurin Bevan Local Health Board until its closure in 2010. In 1901, the Tredegar Medical Aid Society had convened a public meeting to discuss the establishment of a hospital and eventually a committee of more than 30 members was set up to build and manage it.Land for the new Tredegar Park Cottage Hospital, as it was then called, was donated by Lord Tredegar. Funding came from the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company, other local employers and organisations, private and public donations and \"above all\" by the workmen mainly from the pits who agreed to maintain the hospital by having an extra halfpenny a week deducted from their wages. It was opened in December 1904. Walter Conway was employed as secretary of the Medical Aid Society from 1915. He is attributed with organising the society as well as being a mentor to Aneurin Bevan who went to be Minister of Health. Aneurin Bevan, who introduced the National Health Service in 1948, was a member of the Cottage Hospital Management Committee around 1928 and was chairman in 1929/30.

Like other Bucephalidae, they are found in fish both as adults and as metacercariae. In marine and freshwater teleosts, they live as parasites inside the digestive tract, especially the intestine. The genus Bucephalus was based on the earliest known bucephalid, B. polymorphus Baer (1827), initially described from a cercaria larva. Siebold (1848) believed that the adult bucephalid he named Gasterostomum fimbriatum represented an adult form of the same bucephalid, but this identity has never been proved. The name Bucephalus meaning \"ox head\" was chosen because of the horn-like appearance of the forked tail (furcae) of its cercaria. By what Manter calls a \"curious circumstance\", horns are also suggested by the long tentacles of adult worms. They are distinguished from other genera in the same family by having tentacles associated with the anterior sucker. Genus members have their mouth in the middle of the body. An earlier name for this genus was Gasterostomum, given by von Siebold in 1848 to all adult trematodes with a ventral mouth. Odhner (1905) established two suborders of digenean trematodes called Gasterostomata and Protostomata. The two genera in Gasterostomata were Gasterostomum (now Bucephalus) and Prosorhynchus, of which the former has an anterior sucker separate from its digestive tract and the latter has an anterior rhynchus.

It was discovered in 2015.<ref name=\"mclean\"> The virus was identified from the mosquito Aedes vigilax collected from Sydney under the joint research project by scientists at the University of Queensland and the University of Sydney. In experimental infections, the virus is unable to grow in vertebrate cells, but only in Aedes-derived mosquito cell lines. This suggests that the virus does not infect vertebrates. The name is given because it was discovered from Silverwater, a suburb of Sydney on the southern bank of the Parramatta River. The mosquitoes from which the virus was isolated were actually collected in 2007, and had been preserved since then. The study commenced only after the development of the technique of viral detection in mosquitoes in the University of Queensland. The virus was identified as a result of investigation on the outbreak of the Ross River virus in 2015. Both the viruses are transmitted by the same mosquitoes, but PaRV is not transmitted to humans, unlike RRV. According to one of the co-authors, Cameron Webb of the University of Sydney, this unique transmission of PaRV could hold a key \"to vaccinate mosquitoes and stop their bites making thousands of Australians sick every summer.\" The reason, explained by Jody Hobson-Peters of the University of Queensland, is that if mosquitoes (vectors for human diseases) are infected with the PaRV, then they will no longer be able to carry other human-infectious viruses. The virus was identified from the whole genome sequence using Sanger sequencing. The viral genome consists of 10,893 nucleotides and encodes a polyprotein of 3384 amino acids. Comparison with the genomes of other viruses showed that its closest relatives are the Mediterranean Ochlerotatus flavivirus (MoFV) isolated from Ochlerotatus mosquitoes in Spain, and the Hanko virus (HANKV) from Ochlerotatus mosquitoes in Finland (both identified in 2012 ).

They had the form of letters exchanged by members of the Wimsey Family and other characters familiar to readers from the Lord Peter Wimsey detective novels, but were in fact intended to convey Sayers's opinions and commentaries on various aspects of public life in the early months of the Second World War, such as black-out, evacuation, rationing and the need of the public to take personal responsibility rather than wait for the government to guide them. The subjects range from very practical and detailed advice on such issues as how pedestrians can avoid being hit by cars in black-out to quite Utopian and far-reaching schemes for the post-war reconstruction of Britain. Among other things the letters expressed Sayers's displeasure with the Appeasement policies enacted by Neville Chamberlain in the previous years, and her doubts about his fitness to lead Britain in war (at the time of writing, it was not yet known that Chamberlain would soon be replaced by Winston Churchill). The papers also attributed to Harriet Vane a reluctance to go on writing murder mysteries at the time when European dictators were committing mass murders openly and with impunity. This seems to have been Sayers's own feeling, as she in  fact abandoned during World War II the writing of murder mysteries and never took it up again. There is a repeated unfavorable opinion of the Soviet Union, in the aftermath of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the  Soviet attack on Finland. The opinion that there was little to choose between communism and fascism, and that the two kinds of dictatorship are equally reprehensible, is given special prominence by being attributed to Lord Peter Wimsey himself. Other characters are shown as expressing the opinion that, even had Britain managed to conclude an alliance with the Soviet Union in 1939, the Soviets would have proven an unreliable ally of little military worth, given their army's weak performance in Finland. On this point Sayers' opinion, as of most other Britons, did not change in 1941. Getting the Soviets on Britain's side was highly welcome, but the lamentable performance and mass surrenders of the Red Army seemed to bear out the negative assessment. It was only in 1942, when the Germans lost an Army at Stalingrad and American supplies started flowing in, that the resiliency and true strength of Russia became apparent. Some of the letters included in The Wimsey Papers were used by Jill Paton Walsh as the preface for her own novel \"A Presumption of Death\", an authorized sequel continuing the Wimsey series where Sayers left it off. The letters provided much information which Walsh used in the book – Peter Wimsey and his servant Bunter being on a secret mission abroad, Harriet Vane taking her own children and those of her sister-in-law Mary to the country house Talboys in Hertfordshire, Peter's nephew Jerry an RAF combat pilot, and the unsympathetic Duchess Helen working at the Ministry of Instruction and Morale (to whose work Sayers was rather disparaging). The village dance and air raid practice, which are the starting point for the plot of A Presumption of Death, are also derived from one of Sayers' fictional letters, though the idea of making this the scene of a murder to be investigated was Walsh's. Other than the selection made by Walsh and incorporated in her book, The Wimsey Papers had never been re-published. In the Author's Note appended to A Presumption of Death, Walsh cautioned the eager Wimsey fans that \"The Wimsey Papers are not fiction, and were not intended to be read in a continuous chunk\" and that \"Some of them are about details of war-time history that would now require extensive footnotes in explication\". Nevertheless, one such fan made the effort to retype them from archive copies of The Spectator and make them available online (see External Links). The papers do provide some significant new details to the character of Wimsey, in particular the ironic epitaph he writes for himself when setting out for dangerous mission behind enemy lines: Here lies an anachronism in the vague expectation of eternity. They also show that in addition to his thorough knowledge of the classics of English literature, Wimsey is familiar – though in fundamental disagreement – with the works of Karl Marx, and well able to debate with Marxists on their home ground.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Keith Knight may refer to:","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Jay Meuser (September 28, 1911 — August 19, 1963) was an American abstract expressionist painter.

Meriam Ibrahim was arrested during her second pregnancy for apostasy and gave birth to a girl in prison on 27 May 2014. Mariam Ibrahim's case is part of a wider problem of persecution of Christians in Sudan. Meriam Ibrahim was born to a Muslim father, who left her Ethiopian Orthodox mother to raise her from early childhood. She was raised in her mother's faith and married a Christian man; the marriage certificate has been published. Meriam Ibrahim was reportedly turned in to the authorities by one of her relatives, who claimed Mariam was committing adultery by marrying Daniel Wani, a Christian. She was sentenced to death on 15 May 2014, for allegedly committing apostasy from Islam, meaning that she was accused of changing religion from Islam to a different (or no) religion. Although Meriam Ibrahim said she has always been a Christian, the prosecution claimed she should have followed the faith of her absent father, and demanded, with the support of the judge, that she abandon her Christian faith, and assent to belief in her father's faith, Islam. She was given three days to convert, but refused, arguing that she had been a Christian all her life, and could not rescind or alter her genuine personal faith at the request of a court. Her husband, Daniel Wani, appealed the sentence on both of their behalfs. On 24 June 2014 Meriam Ibrahim was released on the order of a Sudanese appeal court. The following day, as she and her family were to board a plane to the United States, she and her family were arrested and taken from the airport to Khartoum for questioning following a tip-off to the police by her half brother. The US Ambassador was summoned in protest at the granting of an exit visa, described by the Sudanese Foreign Ministry as 'a criminal violation'.

He succeeded his father Pons of Toulouse upon his death in 1061. His mother was Almodis de la Marche, but she was kidnapped by and subsequently married to Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona when William was a boy. He was married to Emma of Mortain (daughter of Robert, Count of Mortain and a niece of William of Normandy), who gave him one daughter, Philippa. He married twice, and produced two legitimate sons; neither, however, survived infancy, leaving daughter Philippa as his heiress. As Toulouse had no tradition of female inheritance, this raised a question with regard to succession. In 1088, when William departed for the Holy Land, he left his brother, Raymond of Saint-Gilles, to govern in his stead (and, it was later claimed, to succeed him). Within five years, William was dead, and Raymond in a perfect position to take power It has been claimed that William married daughter Philippa off to the King of Aragon, Sancho Ramirez, to prevent her from causing civil war by claiming Toulouse (e.g. Meade, Marion, Eleanor of Aquitaine). However, two recent historians who have made a detailed study of the issue have dismissed this claim. Ruth E Harvey, in \"The wives of the first troubadour Duke William IX of Aquitaine\", Journal of Medieval History, vol 19, 1993, p 315, concludes that, contrary to prior assumptions, William IX was certainly Philippa of Toulouse's only husband. Szabolcs de Vajay, in \"Ramire II le Moine, roi d'Aragon et Agnes de Poitou dans l'histoire et la légende\", Mélanges offerts à René Crozet, 2 vol, Poitiers, 1966, vol 2, p 727-750, states that the marriage to an unnamed king of Aragon reported by a non-contemporary chronicler is imaginary, even though it has appeared broadly in modern histories, and he cites J de Salarrullana de Dios, Documentos correspondientes al reinado de Sancho Ramirez, Saragossa, 1907, vol I, nr 51, p 204-207 to document that his prior wife, Felicie, was clearly still married to Sancho months before his death, thus making the marriage several years earlier to Philippa completely unsupportable. – although, after Philippa married William IX of Aquitaine, they laid claim to Toulouse and fought, off and on, for years to try to reclaim it from Raymond and his children. He was the great-grandfather of Eleanor of Aquitaine, by his daughter's marriage to William IX of Aquitaine, and Eleanor's descendants would continue to lay nominal claim to Toulouse based on descent from William IV.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"John Anderson Fraser, (born June 5, 1944), is a Canadian journalist, writer and academic.

The source contains a proton synchrotron fed by a linear accelerator; short (<500ns) pulses of 1.6 GeV protons are extracted from the synchrotron 25 times a second; these pulses strike a tungsten-metal target (cooled with heavy water) to produce energetic neutrons, which are reduced to scientifically-interesting energies by a variety of moderators. The intended budget for the project is 1.5 billion CNY; this limits the initial power of the machine to about 120 kW, but it has been designed so that its power can readily be quadrupled if more funding becomes available, by upgrading the linear accelerator and the RF components of the synchrotron.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Raj Mittra (born 1 July 1932) is an Electrical Engineering professor at Pennsylvania State University, where he is the director of the Electromagnetic Communication Laboratory of the Electrical Engineering department.

The burial mounds date back to the early Bronze Ages 1800 – 1000 years B.C. These hills are some of the more known view points in Mols Bjerge National Park. Other view points in the area are Agri Baunehøj, Trehøje, Ellemandsbjerg and Jernhatten. In the early Bronze Ages tribal leaders and other important members of society where buried in mounds placed in coffins made from hollowed out oak tree trunks. According to archaeological findings the burial customs changed during the Bronze Ages from coffin burials in oak trunks to cremation in the late Danish Bronze Ages. Probably due to international influence caused by long distance trade with commodities such as copper, tin and cattle. This change in burial customs is probably also the case at Stabelhøje, that most likely hold several generations of burials from different Bronze Age time periods. From the top of the mounds there is a view to Kalø Castle Ruin in Egens Bay - part of Aarhus Bay, and to the coast of Jutland, with Aarhus, Denmarks second largest town, in the distance. One can also see the hilly fields of southern Djursland, and the unfarmed hills of protected central Mols, including the tallest hill in the area, Agri Baunehøj, 137 meters above sea level. There is also a view of Ebeltoft Bay, and of the southernmost peninsula on Djursland, Helgenæs. The difference in elevation is accentuated by views that go all the way down to the surface of the sea. Stabelhøje is accessible via small country roads. There is an infoboard at a small parking lot by the mounds. From here there is a short walk to the top of the southernmost of the two mounds. The mounds are 5 – 6 meters tall. Each is built of up to 650.000 rectangles of turf that where cut out by hand, corresponding to 7 hectares of peeled of heath- and grass-turf per mound. Under influence of rain draining through the surface of the mounds many of the Danish Bronze Age mounds have developed a hard mineral rich layer of soil close to the surface, that isolates the inner mound from contact with water and oxygen from the outside. This lid of hardened soil has helped preserve the artifacts insides the mounds over the centuries. The construction of Bronze Age mounds such as Stabelhøje is an undertaking that involved the work of many people using primitive pre-iron-age tools. A feat that is part of the creation of the 60.000 Stone- and Bronze Age burial mounds registered in Denmark. It has been calculated that 100 - 150 mounds where built each year at the height of this endeavor in the early Danish Bronze Ages, 1800 - 500 B.C. Something that points to an organized 2500- to 3800-year-old pre Christian culture pervaded by a unified religious belief.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Diana Nenova (born April 16, 1985) is a Bulgarian female volleyball player.

After circulation declines in the 1950s and 1960s, the original Courier was purchased in 1965 by John H. Sengstacke, publisher of The Chicago Daily Defender, in 1966. He reorganized the paper under a new name — the New Pittsburgh Courier — to avoid paying several outstanding tax bills and invoices. He later commented: He re-opened it in 1967 under the new name. The New Pittsburgh Courier joined Sengstacke's three other newspapers in a chain of prominent African-American publications, including the Defender. In 1974 Sengstacke appointed Hazel B. Garland as the new editor-in-chief of the New Pittsburgh Courier, making her the first African-American woman in history to be editor of a national newspaper. When asked about his decision, Sengstacke replied: \"I have supreme confidence in Hazel, and believe that she will continue to do a great job as editor-in-chief as she did as city editor. She has proven herself over the many years of dedication to the Courier and the Negro cause. She will be a guiding force in leading this paper to bigger and better things in the future.\" Two years later, the paper won the John B.

The country is located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. It covers and has a population of 2.06 million. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations, European Union, and NATO. The capital and largest city is Ljubljana. The territory is mostly mountainous with a mainly continental climate, with the exception of the Slovene Littoral, which has a sub-Mediterranean climate, and the northwest, which has an Alpine climate. Additionally, the Dinaric Alps and the Pannonian Plain meet on the territory of Slovenia. The country, marked by a significant biological diversity, is one of the most water-rich in Europe, with a dense river network, a rich aquifer system, and significant karst underground watercourses. Over half of the territory is covered by forest. The human settlement of Slovenia is dispersed and uneven. Slovenia has historically been the crossroads of West Slavic, South Slavic, Germanic, Romance, and Hungarian languages and culture. Although the population is not homogeneous, the majority is Slovene. The South Slavic language Slovene is the official language throughout the country. Slovenia is a largely secularized country, but its culture and identity have been significantly influenced by Catholicism as well as Lutheranism. The economy of Slovenia is small, open, and export-oriented and has been strongly influenced by international conditions. It has been severely hurt by the Eurozone crisis, started in the late 2000s. The main economic field is services, followed by industry and construction. Historically, the current territory of Slovenia was part of many different state formations, including the Roman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire, followed by the Habsburg Monarchy. In October 1918, the Slovenes exercised self-determination for the first time by co-founding the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. In December 1918, they merged with the Kingdom of Serbia into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929). During World War II, Slovenia was occupied and annexed by Germany, Italy, and Hungary, with a tiny area transferred to the Independent State of Croatia, a Nazi puppet state. Afterward, it was a founding member of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, later renamed the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a communist state which was the only country in the Eastern Bloc which was never part of the Warsaw Pact. In June 1991, after the introduction of multi-party representative democracy, Slovenia split from Yugoslavia and became an independent country. In 2004, it entered NATO and the European Union; in 2007 became the first formerly communist country to join the Eurozone; and in 2010 joined the OECD, a global association of high-income developed countries.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Fairey Swordfish was a biplane torpedo bomber designed by the Fairey Aviation Company. Originating in the early 1930s, the Swordfish, nicknamed \"Stringbag\", was operated by the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy, in addition to having been equipped by the Royal Air Force (RAF) alongside multiple overseas operators, including the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and the Royal Netherlands Navy. It was initially operated primarily as a fleet attack aircraft; during its later years, the Swordfish became increasingly used as an anti-submarine and training platform. The type was in frontline service throughout the Second World War, but it was already considered obsolescent at the outbreak of the conflict in 1939. Nonetheless, the Swordfish achieved some spectacular successes during the war; notable events included sinking one battleship and damaging two others of the Regia Marina (the Italian Navy) during the Battle of Taranto, and the famous attack on the Bismarck, which contributed to her eventual demise. By the end of the war, the Swordfish held the distinction of having caused the destruction of a greater tonnage of Axis shipping than any other Allied aircraft.

The very act of recording a dream can have the effect of improving future dream recall. Keeping a dream diary conditions a person to view remembering dreams as important.

It is named for its near-parallel strike along the 85th meridian. It is one of two major aseismic ridges in the Bay of Bengal, the other being the Ninety East Ridge. The feature extends from the Mahanadi Basin in the north, off the northeastern coast of India, shifts westwards by about 250 km around 5°N, southeast of Sri Lanka and continues south to the Afanasy Nikitin Seamount in the Central Indian Basin. No wells have been drilled on the ridge. Samples of the ridge from the Afanasy Nikitin Seamount were ultramafic dunite. Seismic studies have shown that the morphology of the ridge including its depth of occurrence varies along the ridge track and that in general the ridge has been buried beneath sediments deposited since the Oligocene. The ridge is associated with complicated gravity and magnetic signatures. The northern part of the ridge is buried beneath thick sediments of the Bengal Fan and shows a negative gravity anomaly. Ridge structures in the south occasionally rise above the sea floor and are associated with a positive gravity anomaly. The magnetic signatures associated with the ridge are complex, with alternate stripes of strong positive and negative anomalies. Magnetic modelling of the ridge suggests that it was emplaced over a period of rapid geomagnetic reversals whereas the underlying oceanic crust was formed in a normal magnetic field of the Cretaceous normal superchron or \"Cretaceous quiet period\". The correlation of the magnetization pattern of the ridge and the geomagnetic polarity timescale suggests that the volcanism that created the ridge started ~80 Ma (magnetic chron time 33r) in the Mahanadi Basin and the process continued southwards, ending at ~55 Ma near the Afanasy Nikitin Seamount. There are several proposals to explain the origin and development of the ridge, one of which is that the volcanism was caused by a short-lived hotspot.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Feuerbach station is an S-Bahn station in the Stuttgart borough of Feuerbach in the German state of Baden-Württemberg.

Like the previous Morris On (1972) and subsequent \"Descendant Of\" Morris On albums, it features English Morris dance tunes and songs, played with a combination of traditional instruments (concertina, melodeon, fiddle, etc.) and modern ones (electric guitar, bass, drums). In common with later records, dancers complete with bells and sticks were also included extensively in the sessions. In retrospect, Hutchings remarked that with Son Of Morris On it was 'attempted to move the Morris forward a little', compared with the Morris On album which featured 'very little dancing' and had a certain rawness to it, which Hutchings found developable and 'endearing' at the same time. A couple of Morris tunes had already been played by early incarnations of Ashley Hutchings' Albion Country Band. The coupling of Jockey To The Fair and Room For The Cuckoo was part of a Morris dance medley in 1972, which was framed by an acoustic and electric setting of Fieldtown Processional. A BBC recording of this medley appears on volume 2 of Ashley Hutchings' ''The Guv'nor'' compilation. Saturday Night and a version of Winster Processional (Furry Dance) were performed in the same year as well. The cover photo by Peter Vernon mirrors that of the original Morris On album with a photograph of the principal participants in morris-associated costume, but with modern accessories.

The censuses were primarily concerned with administration and faced numerous problems in their design and conduct ranging from absence of house numbering in hamlets to cultural objections on various grounds to dangers posed by wild animals to census personnel. The censuses were designed more for social engineering and to further the British agenda for governance rather than to uncover the underlying structure of the population. The sociologist Michael Mann says that the census exercise was \"more telling of the administrative needs of the British than of the social reality for the people of British India.\" The difference of the nature of Indian society during the British Raj from the value system and the societies of the West were highlighted by the inclusion of \"caste\", \"religion\", \"profession\" and \"age\" in the data to be collected, as the collection and analysis of this information had a considerable impact on the structure and political overtones of Indian society.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Din Mohammad Nuristani (born 1928) is a former Afghanistan field hockey player, who competed at the 1948 Summer Olympic Games and the 1956 Summer Olympic Games.
