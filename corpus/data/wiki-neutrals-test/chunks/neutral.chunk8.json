The program was produced by Richard Lowenstein, Selin Yaman and Ghost Pictures and directed by Craig Melville, Richard Lowenstein and a number of other directors under the production company Ghost of Your Ex-Boyfriend Productions in association with SBS Independent. It screened in 2002, and consisted of sketches and outlandish public stunts, typical of Safran's work. The series won two Australian Film Institute Awards; \"Best Comedy Series\" and \"Most Innovative Program Concept\". SBS followed the series up with the similarly styled John Safran vs. God in 2004. An infamous stunt of the series was sneaking nine friends into an exclusive Melbourne nightclub by dressing them up as the masked American metal band, Slipknot. The producers arranged entry for the impostors by pretending to be an American management company over the phone. Other stunts included disguising himself as well known entertainers such as Ozzy Osbourne and Prince to harass the public, sketch versions of music videos such as Eminem, the creation of Jew Town, a Jewish boy band to compete with Christian pop, and returning to Yeshivah College to pay homage to Kevin Bacon in Footloose. He also details his time in the hip-hop group Raspberry Cordial, and the related incident in which he met the Beastie Boys and the band's former DJ attempted to steal his girlfriend at the time. A regular segment on the series was \"The Music Mole\". In this segment a person dressed in a large mole costume (much like a mascot) was interviewed by Safran. The person was reported to be an insider (i.e. a mole) in the music industry who would reveal little known, often controversial facts about both the Australian and international music industries.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Thian Hock Keng (literally \"Palace of Heavenly Happiness\"), also known as the Tianfu Temple, is a temple built for the worship of Mazu (\"Ma Cho Po\"), a Chinese sea goddess, located in Singapore.

Brunius was born on 23 March 1792 in Tanum parish (within the current Tanum Municipality), son of the vicar Gomer Brunius and his wife Mariana Rodhe. He studied at Lund University, where he became professor of Greek in 1824, served as rector in 1831 and 1841 and retired as professor emeritus in 1858. The focus in classical scholarship in the age in which Brunius worked was on the practical mastering of the languages, but beyond a few Latin poems, his contributions within his academic discipline were insignificant and had mostly ceased by the time he received his professorial chair. Instead, he spent most of his life as a student of art, architecture and antiquities and as a working architect. With J. G. Liljegren, Brunius co-authored the first part of Nordiska fornlemningar (\"Scandinavian antiquities\"), published in 1819, and a work on petroglyphs. Brunius later produced the first systematic investigation of mediaeval art and architecture in current Sweden, writing substantial works on the history of art in Scania, on the island of Gotland and elsewhere. In his architectural work, Brunius wanted to revive the mediaeval styles, the Romanesque as well as the more fashionable Gothic, while he detested the more recent Baroque and Rococo styles. His career as an architect began with his work on Lund Cathedral in collaboration with the Stockholm architect Axel Nyström. The Cathedral had for some time been in severe need of restoration, and Nyström was given the job in 1832. Brunius had been a keen draughtsman already as a child and, when on one occasion he was threatened by his parents with being apprenticed to a mason rather than being allowed to continue in school, he had rather relished the thought. He had been elected a member of the Lund Cathedral assembly (domkyrkoråd) in 1831 and was later elected chairman. As such, he was entrusted with the task of supervising the work on the Cathedral, which took more than 25 years to complete. On his own, Brunius designed or restored a number of other buildings in Lund, including the Bishop's House and a house for himself, as well as a large number of parish churches and other buildings in the surrounding province of Scania. Brunius died in Lund on 12 November 1869.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The 1955 season was the forty-fourth season for Santos FC.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Richard Munden (after 25 June 1680 &ndash; 19 December 1725) was a British soldier and Member of Parliament.

Her keel was laid down on 14 June 1938, at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Launched on 1 June 1940, Washington went through fitting-out before being commissioned on 15 May 1941, with Captain Howard H. J. Benson in command. In early 1942, Washington and twenty other American ships were the first to be equipped with fully operational radar. Washington suffered no losses to hostile action during the entire course of the war, although she had some close calls: she was almost hit by \"Long Lance\" torpedoes off Guadalcanal, and was hit once by enemy ordnance, a 5-inch shell that passed through her radar antenna without detonation. In 1942, she was sent to the North Atlantic to fill in for British ships that had been redeployed around Madagascar to counter possible Japanese attacks across the Indian Ocean. She was assigned to guard against a possible sortie by the German battleship, and to provide distant cover for several Iceland–Murmansk convoys. In July 1942, she returned to the United States for an before being deployed to the Pacific in August for action against Imperial Japan, where she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Willis Augustus Lee. Two months after her arrival at Tonga in September 1942, Washington was tasked with intercepting a Japanese naval task force near Guadalcanal along with and four destroyers. In the ensuing battle, South Dakota was severely damaged, but Washington sustained almost no damage while her guns sank the battleship and the destroyer Ayanami. Washington operated as an escort for aircraft carrier task forces for most of 1943, and then bombarded Nauru in December in company with five other battleships. Around dawn on 1 February 1944, Washington rammed the battleship and incurred several fatalities when the latter was maneuvering across the formation to refuel destroyers. With around  of her bow heavily damaged, Washington was forced to retire. The Pearl Harbor shipyards fitted the battleship with a temporary bow; a full restoration had to wait until the ship docked in the Puget Sound Navy Yard. Washington arrived back in the war zone only in mid-1944. She took part in bombarding Saipan and Tinian before joining the Battle of the Philippine Sea, where the Japanese Combined Fleet's aircraft were decisively defeated by American sea-based fighters and anti-aircraft fire. For the rest of the war, Washington alternated between shore bombardment and carrier escort, including direct support in the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. On 1 July 1945, the battleship headed for the United States for a badly needed overhaul. She entered the Puget Sound Navy Yard and did not emerge until October, after the end of the war. She sailed to Philadelphia, participating in Navy Day celebrations there, before her assignment to Operation Magic Carpet, the withdrawal of American military personnel from overseas deployments. Washington was decommissioned on 27 June 1947, on 1 June 1960, and sold for scrapping on 24 May 1961.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"is an anime prequel OVA to The Super Dimension Fortress Macross released for the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Macross franchise during 2002 in Japan.

His mother, Mary, a daughter of Dr. Brandreth of Houghton Regis, and the widow of Arthur Turner, would not allow her son to be sent to a public school, and he was educated by himself, a circumstance which engendered in him habits of isolation and restraint. At an early age he cultivated poetry, two small selections from his effusions circulating among his friends before he was twenty-three. Bray became a student at the Middle Temple in 1801 and was called to the bar in 1806.

Chandra started playing Chess in 2009, when he was about 9 1/2 years of age, during a visit to India. Subsequently, when his family relocated to India for a few years, Akshat was further drawn into the game. In January 2010, Chandra received his starting FIDE rating of 1548. In May 2015, within a period of 5 years and 5 months he crossed the 2500 Grand Master (GM) rating level in realtime rating. This 952 point gain is the fastest rating improvement in the world of this magnitude recorded in such a short time. The gains were achieved prior to FIDE's change of K-factor multiple effective July 2014 for players aged 18 and less with ratings under 2400, which inflated the point gains by 33% for the same level of performance as before. In April 2015, at the age of 15, Chandra won the highest Scholastic Chess title in the US–the National K-12 Championship. In July 2015, he became the US Junior Champion (Closed). This was the first time in US Chess that both the top Scholastic and the Junior titles were held by the same individual in a single year. In addition, Chandra was the 2015 National High School Blitz Chess Champion as well. In April 2013, as a 13-year old, Chandra won the K-9 Super-National championship. Chandra has been consistently ranked as the number 1 player in the US in his age category since 2013. He has also been part of the United States Chess Federation (USCF) All America Chess Team for each year, and has qualified to represent the US at the World Youth Championships in all years since 2013. At the age of 14, Chandra won the gold at the North American Youth Championship, U-18 section, in Toronto, Canada. Since April 2014, at the age of 14, Chandra has remained the highest USCF rated Junior Rapid Chess player (U21) in the country. After learning chess from local part-time coaches, Chandra, at the age of 10, began working with his first professional coach, the Serbian GM Predrag Trajkovic, who worked with him for about 4 1/2 years until early 2014, and exposed him to the typical Soviet style of chess focused on positional understanding. Chandra is also an avid writer. He has documented his journey from a beginner to Grandmaster level on his personal website. He is also the youngest regular writer for the most visited chess media website in the world, Chessbase, and also contributes articles to the USCF official website. Besides growing up in the US, Chandra has also lived in India for a few years, and for a few months in Europe in 2012. Chandra was a recipient of the 2016 U.S. Chess Trust Scholar-Chess Player award, sponsored by the U.S. Chess Trust and the National Scholastic Chess Foundation.

The event was led by eighteen Presbyterian ministers, but numerous Methodist and Baptist preachers also spoke and assisted. Many of the \"spiritual exercises\", such as glossolalia and ecstatic attendees, were exhibited that in the 20th century became more associated with the Pentecostal movement. Cane Ridge is located in Bourbon County, Kentucky near Paris. The ridge was named by the explorer Daniel Boone, who had noticed a form of bamboo growing there. The Cane Ridge building and grounds had many unusual aspects. The 1791 Cane Ridge Meeting House is believed to be the largest single-room log structure in North America. The burial ground contains an unmarked section that is among the largest in the country. A Christian church congregation met on the site for many years after the 1801 revival meeting, and the congregation's leaving the Presbyterian Church in 1804. Barton W. Stone was its minister and one of the leading ministers of the Christian Church. This place was so dear to him that at his request, several years after his death, his remains were reinterred there. Led by Barton Stone, the Cane Ridge Revival is associated with the development of what became known as the Restoration Movement. Stone and several other ministers left the Presbyterian Church in 1804 and established the Christian Church. Another element of the Restoration Movement was Alexander Campbell's Disciples of Christ. In 1832, Stone and Campbell agreed to combine their efforts in the Restoration Movement. Later groups developed as the Churches of Christ and the Evangelical Christian Church in Canada, and several smaller groups.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"A keepalive (KA) is a message sent by one device to another to check that the link between the two is operating, or to prevent the link from being broken.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Wake Shield Facility is an experimental science platform that was placed in low Earth orbit by the Space Shuttle. It is a 3.7 meter (12 ft) diameter, free-flying stainless steel disk. The WSF was deployed in the wake of the Space Shuttle at an orbital altitude of over 300 kilometers (186 mi), within the thermosphere, where the atmosphere is exceedingly tenuous. The forward edge of the WSF disk redirected atmospheric and other particles around the sides, leaving an \"ultra-vacuum\" in its wake. The resulting vacuum was used to study epitaxial film growth. The WSF has flown into space three times, on board shuttle flights STS-60, STS-69 and STS-80. During STS-60, some hardware issues were experienced, and, as a result, the WSF was only deployed at the end of the shuttle's robotic arm. During the later missions, the WSF was deployed as a free-flying platform in the wake of the shuttle. These flights proved the vacuum wake concept, and realized the space epitaxy concept by growing the first-ever crystalline semiconductor thin films in the vacuum of space. These included gallium arsenide (GaAs) and aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) depositions. These experiments have been used to develop better photocells and thin films. Among the potential resulting applications are artificial retinas made from tiny ceramic detectors. Pre-flight calculations suggested that the pressure on the wake side could be decreased by some 6 orders of magnitude over the ambient pressure in low Earth orbit (from 10 −8 to 10 −14 Torr). Analysis of the pressure and temperature data gathered from the two flights concluded that the decrease was some 2 orders of magnitude (4 orders of magnitude less than expected). The Wake Shield is sponsored by the Space Processing Division in NASA's Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications. Wake Shield was designed, built and is operated by the Center for Advanced Materials (formerly Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center) at the University of Houston&mdash;a NASA Commercial Space Center&mdash;in conjunction with its industrial partner, Space Industries, Inc., also in Houston.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Cory Anthony Booker (born April 27, 1969) is an American politician and the junior United States Senator from New Jersey, in office since 2013.

The algorithm typically starts with a uniform random distribution of particles over the configuration space, meaning the robot has no information about where it is and assumes it is equally likely to be at any point in space. Whenever the robot moves, it shifts the particles to predict its new state after the movement. Whenever the robot senses something, the particles are resampled based on recursive Bayesian estimation, i.e., how well the actual sensed data correlate with the predicted state.

It was created by Darcy Ribeiro, in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1953. As the only official institution in Brazil exclusively dedicated to indigenous cultures (the people known as povos indígenas in Portuguese), the museum has the objective of promoting an accurate and updated image for the indigenous cause, while avoiding common misconceptions and prejudice of these societies. In 1978, the museum was moved to an old mansion built in the era of the 1880s, in the Botafogo district. It had been originally constructed by João Rodrigues Teixeira, an entrepreneur involved in the food industry of Rio de Janeiro. Constructed by Teixeita as his family residence, the mansion house is registered by the Instituto do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional or IPHAN (English: National Institute of Historic and Artistic Sites). The architectural style of its construction is quite representative of this period of urban growth. The rich collection of the museum, which includes most of the present-day indigenous societies, is composed of 14,000 ethnography parts. In the Marechal Rondon Library, 16,000 national and foreign publications specialized in ethnology and other related areas, plus 50,000 images in diverse environments, including 3,000 digital photographs on CD-ROM, about 200 films, videos, and sound recordings, as well as 500,000 documents of historical value relating to various indigenous groups and their political situation in Brazil from the end of 19th century to the present. In the eleven rooms of the main building, the Museu do Índio organizes the temporary showing of samples of paintings and photos using the collection storied in its archives. In the gardens of the institution there are five different environments, including a Guarani fazenda, a Xingu kitchen and ritual house for the Xingu Quarup (also spelled \"Kuarup\"). In March 2013, police stormed the site of the previous museum building that once housed Brazil’s first Indian Museum. The objective was to end a standoff with more than 20 indigenous protesters who had squatted for years in an adjacent structure.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The 1891–92 Scottish Football League was the second season of the Scottish Football League.

The single was released in 1979 and peaked at number 32 in the US. The single has become one of the band's more widely known tracks. The song was originally recorded with Cheap Trick bass guitar player Tom Petersson singing the lead vocal, but it was later rerecorded for the Dream Police album with Cheap Trick's usual lead vocalist, Robin Zander, singing the lead. On the released track, Petersson and Nielsen provide back up vocals. The song is unusual for Cheap Trick in that six or seven vocal tracks are layered in, making it impossible to replicate the sound on the album in live concerts. Steve Lukather of the band Toto plays lead and acoustic guitar on the version of the song on Dream Police, but is uncredited. Prior to its release on Dream Police, \"Voices\", backed by \"Surrender\", was released as a single in the UK as a promotion for the upcoming album. However, when the album release was delayed, the single was quickly pulled. When Dream Police was finally on the verge of being released, Arnold Levine directed a promotional film of the band featuring \"Voices\" and two other songs from the album, \"Dream Police\" and \"Way of the World\".

The rationale for the studies was that there is more benefit from studying the habits of successful language learners than there is from studying learners who fossilize at an early stage or stop studying altogether. It was thought that if the strategies of successful learners could be found, then that knowledge could help learners who were not getting such good results. The original studies were made in the 1970s, but petered out in the 1980s as researchers concentrated on individual learning strategies. However, some research on the topic has also been carried out in more recent years. The main body of GLL research investigated language learning in classroom situations. It found that good language learners could not be distinguished on the basis of observable behavior alone, although personality did seem to have an effect. It also found that teachers did not treat these learners differently from other students, although they could distinguish good language learners from learners who were not so effective.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Bangi–Tetela languages are a proposed intermediate clade of Bantu languages that comprise a large part of Guthrie's Zone C (Motingea 1996):","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Booksellers Association of the UK and Ireland (BA) is a trade body founded to promote retail bookselling in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

The album was released at the advent of the sexual revolution, Cole's biographer Daniel Mark Epstein would subsequently write of the album that \"The lyrics tell the story of a man's search for romantic love-its excitements and frustrations, joys and sorrows-with a forward, blunt emphasis on carnal lust, and an edge of cynicism that would have been wholly offensive only a few years earlier\". Wild Is Love was one of six albums nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 3rd Annual Grammy Awards in 1961, where it lost to Bob Newhart's The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart.

He is known as a record producer, film and television producer, show promoter and aspiring entrepreneur. The Early Years Hadaway started his career in 1969 as a promotion and management agent, sponsoring and producing gigs throughout the seventies. Under the brand’s “Satril Management” and “Big Ear Promotions” he booked famous names including David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Wishbone Ash and Matt Monroe for shows at famous London venues including The Palladium, the former Mean Fiddler, The Marquee and The Lyceum. He is notably responsible for coining the prestigious “Sunday Rock at the Lyceum”. Hadaway also hosted a variety of big acts from the Motown label including The Four Tops, Marv Johnson, Jimmy Ruffin and Edwin Starr. In 1971, Henry Hadaway founded HHO (the “Henry Hadaway Organisation”) that to this day operates internationally as a multimedia licensor. Surviving over 48 years, HHO is considered one of the longest running UK independents and controls copyrights for over 20,000 audio and visual titles. The Satril Years In 1973, Hadaway founded “ Satril Records” – a record label that went on to release many well-known Rock and Disco titles. Satril’s label identity had over 25 different territories and achieved great success on the recording front with such acts as The Sandpipers, who charted with “Hang On Sloopy”, Kenny Lynch, who had a best-seller with “ Half The Day's Gone And We Haven't Earned a Penny” and Godiego, who were smash hits in the Japanese market (sales of over 32 million units). In one quarter, Godeigo under Hadaway’s jurisdiction had two albums and three best-selling singles. In parallel to running Satril Records, Hadaway founded and managed Satril Studios (a recording studio based in Finchley) that was regularly used by such top industry names as producers including Biddu and Steve Levine, and acts including Marvin Gaye and Kenny Lynch amongst the many others that came to record, produce and feature in sessions. Hadaway himself produced records for artists including Burnt Oak (better known as Mr. Big), The Sandpipers, The Rockin' Berries, Connie Francis and the great Frankie Vaughan. His most renowned production to date however is “The Birdie Song” (performed by The Tweets) which sold over 1.6 million copies in the UK alone, and is rated one of the best sellers during the eighties. The Birdie Song was featured live on Top Of The Pops in 1981. Hadaway was interviewed on Channel 4 about his production of this track. The Eighties During the eighties, Hadaway acquired numerous audio and visual catalogues. Through a deal with Florida based comedian/impresario Mike Winters, Hadaway became responsible for the catalogues of Church Street Station and Rock ‘N' Roll Palace music TV, video and record series, which attracted such superstar names as Tammy Wynette, Merle Haggard, George Jones and Jerry Lee Lewis. Henry Hadaway’s success in the music industry has fundamentally been accredited to an international outlook – operating in and communicating with both domestic and international territories. He opened offices for HHO in Cleveland, Nashville and Sydney. He also established strong business relations with the Asian and Far East markets. Throughout the eighties, Hadaway continued to promote gigs in Europe, including a prestigious festival in Malta (December 1989) on the occasion of the historic summit between President’s George W. Bush and Mikael Gorbachev. Working closely with the first Maltese Prime Minister Dom Mintoff, Hadaway staged “Give Peace A Chance”, a concert to promote world peace. The concert featured international pop names including Chris de Burgh, Leo Sayer, Sinitta, Aimii Stewart, Heatwave and Aswad. Hadaway was interviewed on Maltese TV about his contributions to the music industry during this time. Visual Production In more recent times Hadaway has branched further into visual media, producing programmes tailored for broadcast including the prestigious Peter Green documentary  (2009), shown on BBC and Sky Arts. He also co-wrote the script for the film,  Inside Out. Awards Over the years, Hadaway has been a continued annual presence at the MIDEM music market in Cannes, for which various awards have been credited for contributions to the industry and to the convention itself, including two awards from the Mayors of Cannes. In 2013, Henry Hadaway was awarded an MBE for services to the creative industry.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Rajac can refer to the following places in Serbia:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Barboza is a surname of Portuguese or Hispanic origin that may refer to:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Noah Glass is an American software developer, best known for his early work launching Twitter and Odeo, a podcasting company that closed in 2007.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The 1990 Skate Canada International was held in Lethbridge, Alberta on October 25–28.

The initial product offering represented four of the branches of the U.S. armed forces with the Action Soldier (U.S. Army), Action Sailor (U.S. Navy), Action Pilot (Air Force), Action Marine (Marine Corps) and later on, the Action Nurse. The name derived from the usage of \"G.I. Joe\" for the generic U.S. soldier, itself derived from the more general term \"G.I.\". The development of G.I. Joe led to the coining of the term \"action figure\". G.I. Joe's appeal to children has made it an American icon among toys. The G.I. Joe trademark has been used by Hasbro for several different toy lines, although only two have been successful. The original line introduced on February 2, 1964 centered on realistic action figures. In the United Kingdom, this line was licensed to Palitoy and known as Action Man. In 1982 the line was relaunched in a scale complete with vehicles, playsets, and a complex background story involving an ongoing struggle between the G.I. Joe Team and the evil Cobra Command which seeks to take over the Free World through terrorism. As the American line evolved into the Real American Hero series, Action Man also changed, by using the same molds and being renamed as Action Force. Although the members of the G.I. Joe team are not superheroes, they all had expertise in areas such as martial arts, weapons, and explosives. G.I.

Under the CSA, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I substance, determined to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use – thereby prohibiting even medical use of the drug. At the state level, however, policies regarding the medical and recreational use of cannabis vary greatly, and in many states conflict significantly with federal law. The medical use of cannabis is legal (with a doctor's recommendation) in 29 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico. Seventeen other states have laws that limit THC content, for the purpose of allowing access to products that are rich in cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component of cannabis. Although cannabis remains a Schedule I drug, the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment prohibits federal prosecution of individuals complying with state medical cannabis laws. The recreational use of cannabis is legal in 9 states (Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington) plus the District of Columbia, and decriminalized in another 13 states plus the U.S. Virgin Islands. Commercial distribution of cannabis is allowed in all jurisdictions where cannabis has been legalized, except Vermont and the District of Columbia. Prior to January 2018, the Cole Memorandum provided some protection against the enforcement of federal law in states that have legalized, but it was rescinded by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. There are currently three cannabinoid drugs (Marinol, Syndros, and Cesamet) that can be prescribed in accordance with federal law. The drug cannabidiol cannot legally be prescribed (as with whole-plant cannabis), due to the fact that the Drug Enforcement Administration considers it a Schedule I drug. Despite this classification, a number of online retailers sell CBD products to all 50 states, claiming such products are derived from industrial hemp plants and therefore legal.

Sitting in London from April 28 to July 10, it was the longest Parliament up until that time. It took place during a time when the English court was perceived by much of the English population to be corrupt, and its traditional name was due to the sincere efforts by its members to reform the government. It had a formidable enemy, however, in John of Gaunt, fourth son of Edward III and the effective ruler of England at the time. Parliament had not met since November 1373, 2½ years previously, because Edward III and his councilors recognised the danger of calling parliament during a period of dissatisfaction. However, the need for funds was so pressing in 1376 that another Parliament was necessary. Once the members were assembled, they were determined to clean up the corrupt Royal Council. Peter de la Mare, a knight of the shire representing Herefordshire, had been elected as Speaker by the House of Commons, and on the first day he delivered an address criticising England's recent military failures, condemning the corruption at court, and calling for close scrutiny of the royal accounts. Richard Lyons (Warden of the Mint) and Lord Latimer, who were believed to be robbing the treasury, were called before parliament and then imprisoned. Latimer's impeachment is the earliest recorded in Parliament. The king's mistress, Alice Perrers, was called and condemned to seclusion. John of Gaunt raised the question of the Salic law, which was the basis for the French case against Edward III's claim to the Crown of France, suggesting that the English follow the French custom, but was unable to sway the assembly to his point of view. Meanwhile, the eldest prince of the realm, Edward the Black Prince, was dying. Having taken a house in London, he summoned both Edward III and John of Gaunt and made them swear to recognise his son, the future Richard II, as successor to Edward. Both John and the King swore to recognise Richard, and soon after Parliament summoned Richard and acknowledged him as heir to the throne. The members were swayed by the immense prestige of Prince Edward, the country's greatest military hero at the time. Parliament then imposed a new set of councillors on the King: Edmund Mortimer, the earl of March; William Courtenay, bishop of London; and William of Wykeham, bishop of Winchester. Parliament was dissolved in July, and the following autumn, John of Gaunt attempted to undo its work. He barred the admission of the new councillors assigned to the king. He threw Peter de la Mare into prison at Nottingham. He dismissed the new council and recalled Latimer. Alice of Perrers was restored to the company of the king. John also attacked William of Wykeham. In 1377, John had another Parliament convene, the Bad Parliament. John had the Good Parliament declared unconstitutional and its acts removed from the books. Despite this, the public treasured the memory of the reforming Parliament and bestowed upon it the name of the Good Parliament.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Science Council is a UK organisation that was established by Royal Charter in 2003.

The first documented citation dates from the year 1048. The castle itself is believed to have been built around 1100. It was first mentioned by name in connection with the division of an estate in 1247. About 1580 Count Heinrich IV renovated the castle. In 1896 it came into the possession of the Prussian Forstfiskus, and served for years as a forest house. The castle and grounds have been used since 1928 as a youth hostel. Over time, modifications to keep up with the times became necessary. On October 23, 1986, after a complete renovation, it was ceremonially reopened by German President Richard von Weizsäcker. At about 60,000 overnight stays a year, it ranks with the most visited youth hostels in Germany. Freusburg provides an excellent view of the surrounding woods and of the Sieg Valley and Freusburg Mill.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Runaways is an American comic book series created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona for Marvel Comics. The series debuted in April 2003. It has covered 13 story arcs, and is currently in its fourteenth. Runaways has frequently been collected in digest-sized books, which led to booming sales. Series creator Vaughan wrote the entire first volume and most of the second, which was continued and ended by Joss Whedon. Rainbow Rowell currently runs the series. Runaways is frequently praised for being a simple story while being set in the typically complex and twisting Marvel Universe. While it was initially intended to be a six-part miniseries, the popularity of \"Pride & Joy\" and new ideas from writer Vaughan allowed it to grow into a regular monthly Marvel title, Runaways. Runaways has subsequently won several comics awards, including the 2006 Harvey Award for Best Continuing or Limited Series.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Kristen Henderson (or Kristen Ellis-Henderson) is a founding member, guitarist and songwriter for the all female popular rock band Antigone Rising.

It is endemic to California, where it is known from Mendocino County southwards to Santa Barbara County. This taxon is limited to the Coast Range mountains. It grows in forests with other conifers, as well as chaparral and other local mountain habitat, usually in pure stands on serpentine soils. It generally grows 10 to 15 meters (33–50 feet) tall, but it is known to exceed 22 meters (73 feet). On Carson Ridge in Marin County, as well as Hood Mountain in Sonoma County, the species comprises a pygmy forest of trees which do not attain heights greater than 240–360 cm (8–12 feet) due to high mineral concentrations in the serpentine soil. One notable population occurs in the Cedar Mountain Ridge area of Eastern Alameda County. According to Carl Wolf, who extensively studied the New World Cypress in the 1930s and 1940s, seed from the Cedar Mountain stand of Cupressus sargentii produced the most vigorous seedlings. Like many of the New World Cupressaceae, Sargent Cypress usually reproduces with the aid of wildfire, which cause an opening of the cones and exposure of bare mineral soil for seedling germination, though occasionally seeds will fall and germinate without fire, though such seems to be the exception rather than the rule. It is often the case that many trees in a particular stand will all be the same age, so that a sort of stratification occurs of different colonies all of the same age. Sargent Cypress can begin producing cones as early as five or six years of age.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Anthony Donnelly (April 1886 – April 1947) was an English footballer whose regular position was at full back.

A player who plays two instruments from the same family (e.g., oboe and English horn, clarinet and bass clarinet, flute and piccolo) is also often considered a woodwind doubler, but is usually paid less than a player who plays instruments from different families. Longtime classical music practice has expected the non-principal player in a section to double the common auxiliary instrument (e.g., 2nd flute and piccolo; 2nd oboe and English horn). In commercial work, including Hollywood film scores and—most notably—Broadway musicals, the practice gradually evolved, with some specialists developing great expertise with multiple members of three, four, or even all five of the woodwind families noted above. In such commercial work, players are paid an additional (percentage) premium for each additional double—but hiring four or five proficient \"reed doublers\" is still more cost-effective to the production than hiring numerous additional players. Even before 1940, Broadway reed players were commonly expected to double three, four, or five instruments; one of the most notorious mid-century examples was the Reed III book for West Side Story (1957), requiring flute, piccolo, oboe, English horn, clarinet, bass clarinet, and tenor & baritone saxophones.

The original definition of biosecurity started out as a set of preventive measures designed to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious diseases in crops and livestock, quarantined pests, invasive alien species, and living modified organisms (Koblentz, 2010). The emerging nature of biosecurity threats means that small scale risks blow up rapidly, thus an effective policy becomes a challenge for there are limitations on time and resources available for analysing threats and estimating the likelihood of their occurrence. The term was first used by the agricultural and environmental communities. Starting from the late 1990s in response to the threat of biological terrorism, biosecurity encompasses the prevention of the intentional removal (theft) of biological materials from research laboratories. These preventative measures are a combination of systems and practices put into its place at bioscience laboratories to prevent the use of dangerous pathogens and toxins for malicious use, as well as by customs agents and agricultural and natural resource managers to prevent the spread of these biological agents. Advances in technology have meant that many civilian research projects in medicine have the potential to be used in military applications (dual-use research) and biosecurity protocols are used to prevent dangerous biological materials from falling into the hands of malevolent parties. The National Academy of Sciences define biosecurity as \"security against the inadvertent, inappropriate, or intentional malicious or malevolent use of potentially dangerous biological agents or biotechnology, including the development, production, stockpiling, or use of biological weapons as well as outbreaks of newly emergent and epidemic disease\".
