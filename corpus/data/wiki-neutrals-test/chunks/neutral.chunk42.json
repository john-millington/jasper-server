{"lines":[{"value":"Eryniopsis lampyridarum is an entomopathogenic fungus and its host is the soldier beetle, either Chauliognathus marginatus or Chauliognathus pensylvanicus. Eryniopsis lampyridarum is mind controlling for the soldier beetle and can manipulate the beetle into doing things that it wouldn't normally do. Once the fungus has established itself inside the beetle, it sends the infected beetle on a mission to find a specific daisy flower Asteraceae. The soldier beetle will clamp its mouthpiece onto the flower as tight as it can, while it awaits its death. The parasitic fungus forces the dead beetle to then spread its wings wide in a dramatic pose; this makes the beetle look bigger as if it is seeking out a mate. The fungus makes sure the dying beetle will attract more beetles so it can spread its spores. Interestingly enough, the fungus makes sure the beetle spreads its wings only at daybreak. It is also strange that the beetle will be dead for hours and then suddenly it will spread its wings at daylight, just in time to attract potential mates to its dead body. This is because the fungus is in control of the beetle's body functions. Then, when an uninfected beetle comes along to socialize with the dead beetle, the fungus makes sure its spores spread to the new beetle. Not all beetles will end up at a daisy flower. Some will die and fall to the ground. In this case, the parasitic fungus creates many spores that will be resistant to the environment and remain infective for many months. The spores will remain infective in the soil, awaiting the next season where they can infect more soldier beetles. This parasite was first discovered in North Carolina in the late 70s, early 80s. It has only been found in eastern and central North America, although its host, the soldier beetle, is found in southern Canada as well.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Perry Martin (born 1993) is an English international lawn and Indoor bowler.

It runs from the border with North Carolina (where it continues as North Carolina Highway 168 towards the Outer Banks) through the independent cities of Chesapeake and Norfolk where it ends in the Ocean View area near the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel. SR 168 consists of three sections with different characteristics. From North Carolina to the junction with Interstate 64 and Interstate 464, SR 168 is mostly built to freeway standards as a major road into North Carolina; part of it - the Chesapeake Expressway - is a toll road. From I-64 north into downtown Norfolk, SR 168 is a local road; I-464 carries most through traffic. The rest of SR 168, from downtown Norfolk north to Ocean View, is Tidewater Drive, an arterial road with some interchanges, built to carry traffic to the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel before Interstate 64 opened. SR 168 was originally constructed in the 1930s on the north side of Hampton Roads as Merrimack Trail, mainly as a bypass of U.S. Route 60 from Newport News past Williamsburg (now State Route 143). It was extended across Hampton Roads (via the Newport News-Pine Beach (Norfolk) Ferry) in the mid-1940s, but did not move onto its current alignment to North Carolina until 1957, when the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel opened. As the new freeway (Interstate 64) opened past Williamsburg, SR 168 was shifted to it; it was truncated to its current extent around 1980.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The '''Japan women's national football team''', or Nadeshiko Japan (なでしこジャパン), is a selection of the best female players in Japan and is run by the Japan Football Association (JFA).

Both were based mostly on BA-I, the most important development being the new turret, same as in the T-26 m 1933 and BT-5 tanks, and also equipped with the 45 mm main gun. Around 180 BA-3 cars were built at the Izhorskij and Vyksunskij factories, until production ended in 1935. BA-6 followed with 386 cars produced between 1936 and 1938 in Izhorskij factory. Most of BA-3 production was based on the Ford-Timken chassis, a 6×4 modification of the US Ford AA 4×2 truck, but the last batch was built on Russian version of the same chassis - GAZ-AAA, continued to be used in BA-6. The biggest limitation of the BA-3 was the mobility, limited to roads or very hard ground, the result of unnecessarily large weight. The innovation that slightly improved mobility were the auxiliary (\"Overall\") tracks that could be fitted onto the rear tandem wheels, converting the car to half-track. The BA-3 is externally very similar to the BA-6; the BA-3 retained door in the rear of the hull that was not present in the BA-6. More important improvement of BA-6 were the new GK tires, filled with sponge (porous rubber), and thus much less vulnerable to small-caliber fire. On the downside, the tires reduced both the speed and range of the vehicle, despite it had a somewhat thinned armor. BA-3/6 cars were superseded by BA-10 model. All cars of this series were very heavily armed for the era; they could knock out other vehicles with ease, including tanks. However, their thin armor made them vulnerable to heavy machine gun fire and small caliber cannon fire. A prototype railway BA-3ZD variant was created in 1936, but was not accepted for production. The BA-6ZD was produced in limited numbers. The BA-3/6 were used in combat in the Spanish Civil War, against the Japanese in the Battle of Khalkhyn Gol, in the Finnish Winter War, and against the Germans in the early stages of the Eastern Front. Ironically, the German Army used a few Spanish-built six-wheeled armored cars that were close copies of the BA-3/6 series. Later in the war, the BA-3/6/10 were replaced in the Red Army's heavy scout vehicle role by light tanks, such as the T-60 and T-70. A few captured BA-3 cars were used by Finnish army under designation BAF A (sometimes also BA-32-1), and captured BA-6 cars under designation BAF B.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Pukatawagen Water Aerodrome,, was located on Pukatawagan Lake, Pukatawagan, Manitoba, Canada.

The 5S introduced the A7 64-bit dual-core system-on-chip, the first 64-bit processor to be used on a smartphone, accompanied by the M7 \"motion co-processor\". A redesigned home button with Touch ID, a fingerprint recognition system which can be used to unlock the phone and authenticate App Store and iTunes Store purchases, was introduced. The camera was also updated with a larger aperture and a dual-LED flash optimized for different color temperatures. The iPhone 5S was the first Apple device to ship with iOS 7, which introduced a revamped visual appearance and other new features. Designed by Jonathan Ive, iOS 7 departed from skeuomorphic elements used by previous versions of iOS in favor of a flat, colorful design. Among new software features introduced to the iPhone 5S were AirDrop, an ad-hoc Wi-Fi sharing platform; Control Center, a control panel containing a number of commonly used functions; and iTunes Radio, an internet radio service.

Formed in 1988, the band was founded by Chino Moreno (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Stephen Carpenter (lead guitar), Abe Cunningham (drums) and Dominic Garcia (bass). During the group's first five years, the band's lineup changed several times, but stabilized in 1993 when Cunningham rejoined the group after his departure in 1990; by this time, Chi Cheng was the band's bassist. The lineup remained stable for fifteen years, with the exception of keyboardist and turntablist Frank Delgado being added in 1999. The band is known as one of the most experimental groups to have come from the alternative metal music scene. They are sometimes dubbed \"the Radiohead of metal\" by critics. Deftones have released eight albums since their inception. After the lineup settled in 1993, the band secured a recording contract with Maverick Records, and subsequently released their debut album, Adrenaline, in 1995. Promoting the album by touring exhaustively with other bands in the scene, Deftones managed to gain a dedicated fan base through word of mouth. Their sophomore album, Around the Fur, was released in 1997. The album and its singles reached chart positions, and the album was the band's first to receive certification from the RIAA. The band found even further success with their third album, White Pony, in 2000. It showed a transition away from the band's earlier sound into a more experimental direction. Its lead single, \"Change (In the House of Flies)\", is the group's most commercially successful single, and the album track \"Elite\" won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. White Pony was the band's first of three albums to be certified platinum in the United States. Their self-titled fourth album was released in 2003. While the group's critical success continued, sales proved to be lackluster compared to White Pony. The follow-up, Saturday Night Wrist, was released in 2006 after a temporary falling out within the band due to creative tensions. Its completion was also delayed by personal issues within the band, some of which influenced its material. In 2008, while Deftones were working on an album tentatively titled Eros, Cheng was involved in a traffic collision. As a result, he was left in a minimally conscious state until his death in 2013 of cardiac arrest. During that time, Deftones halted production on Eros. Quicksand bassist Sergio Vega, who had filled in as a touring member to replace Cheng, later became his permanent replacement. The band released Diamond Eyes and Koi No Yokan in 2010 and 2012 respectively. Their latest release, titled Gore, was released in 2016.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The suboccipital nerve is the dorsal primary ramus of the first cervical nerve (C1).

As the third son of the King (and, on his mother's side, the great nephew of Pope Calixtus II) Henry was destined for a place in the church from an early age, tonsured at the age of thirteen and ordained two years later. He advanced by stages through the church hierarchy (becoming abbot of several royal monasteries, holding various dignities which were in the King's gift), probably with a view to preparing him for a position of the highest rank, befitting the son of a king. In 1146, however, he was converted from his life as a very wealthy \"secular\" cleric by St. Bernard of Clairvaux and entered Clairvaux Abbey as an ordinary monk. Pope Eugenius III, himself a former Cistercian monk, speaks of Henry in 1147 as humbly washing dishes at Clairvaux. His position as abbot of the collegiate churches was bestowed upon his younger brother Philip. In 1149, on the death of Bishop Odo III of Beauvais, the cathedral chapter, persuaded by Bernard of Clairvaux, elected Henry as their bishop. Henry was ill-prepared for the political responsibilities of his new office, and came into conflict with the burghers of the city. King Louis backed the town, while Henry was supported by his younger brother Robert, Count of Dreux. The conflict was finally settled by Pope Eugenius III in 1151. In 1161 Henry became Archbishop of Reims, succeeded at Beauvais by Bartholomew of Montcornet. Henry organised an important church council at Reims in 1164.

He was the first scholar to correctly identify the Minyag of Tibetan sources with the Xixia of Chinese sources. Stein was born in Schwetz (now Świecie, Poland) to a family of Jewish origin in 1911. As a young man, Stein became interested in the occult, and it was from there that his interest in Tibet began. He received his first degree in Chinese from the Seminar für Orientalische Sprachen at the University of Berlin in 1933. He fled to France the same year. He obtained degrees from l'École nationale des langues orientales vivantes in Chinese (1934) and Japanese (1936). In Paris he studied Tibetan with Jacques Bacot and Marcelle Lalou.

Field Park is a municipal park managed by the parks department of the city of Brockton, Massachusetts. The park consists of of fields, woodlands, and water bodies in northern Brockton and southern Avon, Massachusetts, and is owned by both municipalities. It was created in 1925 as a bequest from Brockton businessman Daniel W. Field, and was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and his son, John Charles Olmsted. Its landscape is dominated by a chain of seven water bodies, all but one of which are man-made, impounding Beaver Brook. The oldest of them, Cross Pond, was created in the 1790s; these lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, were, with one exception, created before the park was laid out, and served either agricultural or industrial purposes. Waldo Lake was created in the 1930s as part of the park's design. Access to the park's interior is via a narrow road long that winds through the grounds, providing access to its major features. This circuit road is accessible from the surrounding public roadways at a number of points, with gates built from locally gathered fieldstone. There is no formalized network of pedestrian paths. As a result, activities tend to be concentrated at the places where there are parking facilities, resulting in some environmental and scenic degradation. The park's most prominent landmark is a fieldstone observation tower, built at the park's high point, known as Indian Cave Hill or Tower Hill. It was built in 1928 from fieldstones gathered from the park grounds. Inside 90 steps, approximately 18 per landing, lead to an observation deck with a visage as far as Blue Hills in all directions. The park is open everyday dawn til dusk; the tower is officially open 1 day a year during Towerfest, early October, Columbus Day weekend.

In contrast with this behavior, diamagnetic materials are repelled by magnetic fields and form induced magnetic fields in the direction opposite to that of the applied magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials include most chemical elements and some compounds; they have a relative magnetic permeability slightly greater than 1 (i.e., a small positive magnetic susceptibility) and hence are attracted to magnetic fields. The magnetic moment induced by the applied field is linear in the field strength and rather weak. It typically requires a sensitive analytical balance to detect the effect and modern measurements on paramagnetic materials are often conducted with a SQUID magnetometer. Paramagnetism is due to the presence of unpaired electrons in the material, so all atoms with incompletely filled atomic orbitals are paramagnetic. Due to their spin, unpaired electrons have a magnetic dipole moment and act like tiny magnets. An external magnetic field causes the electrons' spins to align parallel to the field, causing a net attraction. Paramagnetic materials include aluminium, oxygen, titanium, and iron oxide (FeO). Unlike ferromagnets, paramagnets do not retain any magnetization in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field because thermal motion randomizes the spin orientations. (Some paramagnetic materials retain spin disorder even at absolute zero, meaning they are paramagnetic in the ground state, i.e. in the absence of thermal motion.) Thus the total magnetization drops to zero when the applied field is removed. Even in the presence of the field there is only a small induced magnetization because only a small fraction of the spins will be oriented by the field. This fraction is proportional to the field strength and this explains the linear dependency. The attraction experienced by ferromagnetic materials is non-linear and much stronger, so that it is easily observed, for instance, in the attraction between a refrigerator magnet and the iron of the refrigerator itself.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"In marketing and the social sciences, observational research (or field research) is a social research technique that involves the direct observation of phenomena in their natural setting.

It was discontinued primarily due to the TI Circuit's location in a remote area of Japan. With the announcement that the Japanese Grand Prix would switch from the Suzuka Circuit to the Fuji Speedway from 2007, there had been media speculation that Suzuka may retain a race under a resurrection of the Pacific Grand Prix title. However, it was later announced that the Japanese Grand Prix would alternate between Fuji and Suzuka from 2009 onward although the alternation was cancelled as Toyota, the current Fuji Speedway owner discontinued further F1 races at Fuji.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"63rd Division may refer to:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Schwalm (German) or Swalm (Dutch), is a small river in Germany and the Netherlands, tributary to the river Meuse.

When rising to stand from a sitting or squatting position, both the hamstrings and quadriceps contract at the same time, despite their being antagonists to each other. The rectus femoris biarticular muscle acting over the hip has a smaller hip moment arm than the hamstrings. However, the rectus femoris moment arm is greater over the knee than the hamstring knee moment. This means that contraction from both rectus femoris and hamstrings will result in hip and knee extension. Hip extension also adds a passive stretch component to rectus femoris, which results in a knee extension force. This paradox allows for efficient movement, especially during gait.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Suffolk is a county in East Anglia.

Her first international title came in 2003 when she won the 100 metres sprint at the European Championships in Assen in a time of 18.11 seconds, at that time a new European record. That same day she also participated at the long jump, winning the bronze medal with a leap of 2.95 metres. A month later, she won two gold medals at the Open German Championships in Wattenscheid. She broke the world records in both disciplines: 17.85 seconds over 100 metres and 3.19 metres in the long jump. On 31 May 2004 she broke the World record over 100 metres again, this time during the FBK-Games in Hengelo with a time of 17.20 seconds. She represented the Netherlands at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, not in the 100 metres, but only in the long jump. She jumped a personal best of 3.33 metres, but eventually finished in fifth position, without winning a medal. In Lelystad, she took part in the 2005 Dutch National Championships for Parathletes, where she won her first national titles, coming first in both the 100 metres and the long jump. A day later, she improved her personal best and national record at the long jump to 3.55 metres during the FBK-Games of that year.

She won the 100 metres in 16.96 seconds and made a distance of 3.49 metres in the long jump. In 2007, she did not become the Dutch national 100 metres champion again, but she succeeded for the third consecutive time in the long jump, with a distance of 3.50 metres. Despite missing her third national 100 metres title, she ran a new, but unofficial world record at the Run2Day Track Meetings in Utrecht, to improve to 16.64 seconds. At the 2007 FBK-Games, she jumped 3.57 metres in the long jump and she won the 100 metres race in 16.75 seconds, this time an official World record. On 17 June 2007, in Stadskanaal during the Nelli Cooman-Games, she broke the world record again, this time in 16.57 seconds. She also participated in a race over 200 metres for the very first time in her career, running straight to a new World record of 34.46 seconds. Due to this effort she won the \"Bronze Nelli Cooman Trophy\". At the end of the year she was named Dutch sportsperson of the year with a disability (Joke van Rijswijk Trophy), however she had to share the title with Marion Nijhof, a blind swimmer.

Da Silva won the gold medal because of his two jumps of 8.23m, while Frayne's second-best was 8.17m (from the 2nd round). Russia's Aleksandr Menkov won bronze with his 8.22m, set in the 2nd round.

The technique involves placing an object against the strings while playing to create glissando effects and deep vibratos that make the music emotionally expressive. It typically involves playing the guitar in the traditional position (flat against the body) with the use of a tubular \"slide\" fitted on one of the guitarist's fingers. The slide may be a metal or glass tube like the neck of a bottle. The term \"bottleneck\" was historically used to describe this type of playing. The strings are typically plucked while the slide is moved over the strings to change the pitch. The guitar may also be placed on the player's lap and played with a hand-held bar and is then referred to as \"lap slide guitar\" or \"lap steel guitar\". Creating music with a slide of some type has been traced back to primitive stringed instruments in African culture and also to the origin of the steel guitar in Hawaii. Near the beginning of the twentieth century, blues musicians in the Mississippi Delta popularized the bottleneck slide guitar style, and the first recording of slide guitar was by Sylvester Weaver in 1923. Since the 1930s, performers including Robert Nighthawk, Earl Hooker, Elmore James and Muddy Waters popularized slide guitar in the electric blues genre and influenced later slide guitarists in the rock genre including the Rolling Stones, Duane Allman and Ry Cooder. Lap slide guitar pioneers include Oscar \"Buddy\" Woods, \"Black Ace\" Turner and Freddie Roulette.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Granite Falls is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States.

Before Central Hall was built, there was a previous chapel (called the Oldham Street Chapel), which was opened by John Wesley in 1781. John Wesley and his brother Charles Wesley were the founders of Methodism in England in 1729; the Manchester and Salford Wesleyan mission was named after them, as were many other missions (and missionaries). There were “numerous and flourishing voluntary societies to combat vice, and religious societies to enlighten the faithful”; the society set up by the Wesley brothers in Oxford in 1729 was “to prove that the decline of the religious spirit had been exaggerated”. When the chapel in Oldham Street was demolished, it was replaced by the Methodist Central Hall (which housed the Manchester and Salford Wesleyan Mission). The objective of the mission was simple: to help anyone in Salford and Manchester who required aid and to try to give these people a better quality of life. \"This mission from the beginning has existed for one definite purpose. Its aim has been to evangelise the outcast and to arouse to religious earnestness the crowds in city streets.\" To fulfill its objective, the mission needed to have more than one centre for Manchester and the surrounding areas. There were twelve sites in Manchester and Salford which were owned and used by the mission. Many of the centres (such as Victoria Hall in Daniel Street, Ancoats and the Irwell Street chapel in Salford) were based in areas where the poor and outlaw population of the city lived. The Methodist Mission had eight workplaces, and weekly services at the chapels for men and women who struggled to find faith and a better life.

The Food Depot helped feed the poverty-stricken residents of Manchester and Salford who were victims of the Industrial Revolution. All the work carried out by the sisters and ministers was not only to help people, but “everything is done to lead them to the Lord Jesus Christ”. Central Hall was bombed during World War II; although it was rebuilt, most Mission records were destroyed.

He was editor of The Double Reed, the publication of the International Double Reed Society, for thirty years (1982–2012) and a professor of music at Lionel Hampton School of Music, University of Idaho, for thirty-two years (1968–2000). Ron was born on December 13, 1936 in Lena, Wisconsin, the second son of Robert Louis Klimko and Evelyn Rosera Klimko. He graduated from Oshkosh High School, Oshkosh, Wisconsin and then went on to study choral music on scholarship at Milton College, in Milton, Wisconsin, where he received his bachelor's degree in music education in 1959. Ron began his teaching career at the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison as a teaching assistant while studying for his master's degree in music. In about 1960 he was drafted for a two-year term in the U.S. Army, where he was posted to the Army Element of the Navy School of Music in Norfolk, Virginia. After his discharge, he spent several months abroad in Germany, where he hoped to study music. Opportunities were better back home in Wisconsin, so he returned to study for his Ph.D in music at Madison. While in graduate school he married Kathleen Sorenson (now, Kathleen Rathbun) and they had two sons, Karl Nicholas and Christopher Anthony. While writing his dissertation, he was hired at Minnesota State University Moorhead, in Moorhead, Minnesota, to teach bassoon theory and composition. The next year he was hired at Indiana State University in Terre Haute. His daughter Julie Marie was born in Terre Haute. He finished his dissertation and received his Ph.D. in 1968. From there, he went to the University of Idaho, where he taught bassoon, theory and composition, and music history for 32 years until his retirement in January 2000. His youngest child, Benjamin Andrew was born in Moscow in 1969. In 1986 he was invited to teach at National Music Camp, Interlochen, Michigan, and he taught at the School Music, Indiana University, for the summer of 1980. During his career at the University of Idaho, he contributed to the world of music in a variety of ways. He played bassoon in the Spokane Symphony for 20 years from 1969-1990. He also played bassoon with the Yakima Symphony, Walla Walla Symphony, Mid-Columbia Symphony, and LaGrande Symphony. He played solos with symphonies in Alaska, and the lower 48, as well as in Europe. He gave master classes in bassoon at Lawrence University, Ithaca College, and several other schools. He was conductor of the Spokane Youth Orchestra for one year. He was constantly performing in orchestra and chamber music, and if no events were going on, he would organize a concert, a group, or an event. While at the University of Idaho, he received three sabbatical leave grants. On the first leave, he was in London, England, from January to August 1976, to study with world-renowned bassoonists, William Waterhouse and Cecil James. On the second leave, he was in Paris, France, from September 1983 to August 1984, to study French bassoon privately with the maitre, Maurice Allard of the Paris Opera and Paris Conservatory. On his third leave, he was Visiting Professor of Bassoon at the University of Colorado, Boulder, from 1990 to 1991. He was until his death a member of the North American Wind Quintet, where he played the French bassoon. He authored the well-known book Bassoon Performance, Practices, and Teaching in the United States and Canada (1971, rev. 1992), the first such study of its kind for double reed players. He was the editor of The Double Reed, the professional publication of the International Double Reed Society, from 1982 until his death in 2012. He regularly wrote a column and reviews of recordings for that publication. In 2011 he was honored by the IDRS with a lifetime Honorary Membership. He has traveled around the world to visit with and interview bassoonists for publication in the Double Reed. His original compositions are now archived at the University of Idaho. In his early years of composing he was interested in choral music and opera. He composed an opera to the Huxley work Brave New World but could not publish or perform it due to copyright restrictions. Perhaps someday it will be performed. Over the years he experimented with harmonies and wrote works for woodwind instruments. His own work \"Passages,\" for clarinet and bassoon, was performed at the concert for the celebration of his life held in Moscow, Idaho in June 2012. In retirement, he and his family lived in McCall, Idaho, from 2003 to 2012, where he was President and Director of the McCall Chamber Orchestra. Every year for the last several years he organized a summer concert of the McCall Bassoon Band, now called the Ron Klimko Bassoon Band. Ron arranged many popular and classical works for bassoon quintet and bassoon band. Following a decline in health in 2011, he and his second wife, Kathryn George, relocated to Issaquah, Washington to be nearer to children and better medical care. In 2011 and 2012 he played in the Sammamish Symphony and the Microsoft Orchestra. He reconnected with his old Milton College friend, Glen Danielson, who had recently retired Principal English Horn with the Seattle Symphony. They enjoyed many hours of reminiscences and collegiality in the Microsoft Orchestra. Ron's last performance was with the Microsoft Orchestra, sitting near Glen when they played the Dvorak New World Symphony. Throughout his life, Ron was an avid sports enthusiast and participant. His efforts began at Oshkosh High School, where he was a miler on the track team for three years and lettered in the sport. Ron returned to running in his thirties, where he began competing in fun runs, 10K runs, and marathons. In the mid-1970s, he and Kathleen also began learning to ski and taught his children to ski. In 1995 he took up snowboarding with his son Chris acting as sometime instructor. For many years while teaching at University of Idaho, he ran 6 miles every noon hour with a group of friends, fondly known as Team DeMoura. He ran many local 5ks, 10ks and Fun Runs. Though seldom a first-place winner, he usually placed high in the finishers. He ran Bloomsday in Spokane for over a decade. A member of Palouse Roadrunners, he helped organizers of the Snake River Marathon and ran the marathon itself more than once. Over the years he ran many other marathons, including Oregon, Seattle, Vancouver, Coeur d'Alene, Twin Cities [Minneapolis-St. Paul], Avenue of the Giants [Eureka, CA], Marathon de Bezons, Paris, and the Boston Marathon in 1979. For his fiftieth birthday, he ran the 50K ultra-marathon in Green Lake, Washington. Ron was equally enthusiastic about mountain climbing. He climbed a great many of the volcanoes in the Cascade Mountains of Washington and Oregon, including Mt. Rainier (multiple times), Mt. Adams (many times), Mt. St. Helens (both before and after eruption), Mt. Hood (many times), Mt. Shuksan, and Sahale Peak. In the Tetons of Wyoming, he and Kathleen climbed the Grand and Middle Tetons, Teewenot, and Mt. Owen. He also later climbed Symmetry Spire. He climbed with his family in the Selkirks of Idaho and wrote an article on Chimney Rock for Off Belay. Also, in Idaho, he summited the He Devil in the Seven Devils, and he climbed the Matterhorn, Sacajewea, and Twin Peaks in the Wallowas of southeastern Washington. While in Europe, he climbed Rimpfischhorn, Pollux Peak, Liskalm, and Mt. Blanc in Switzerland. Of all his climbing treks and tours, his most memorable was a trek to Mt. Everest Base Camp in October 1999, where he reached the summit of 18,600-ft Kala Patar, an altitude personal record. The roundtrip trek started at Lukla in Nepal and took about ten days. In his sixties and seventies, his favorite sports were snowboarding and mountain biking. He began skiing in 1970 and while in Europe skied the French, Swiss, and Austrian Alps. While on a tour of New Zealand with his second wife Kathryn, they skied the Tasman Glacier on the South Island. He climbed and skied many of the Cascade volcanoes in the West, skied most of the major areas in Colorado, Montana and Idaho, and Lake Louise in Canada. He was an avid back-country skier until age 70, spending a week in May with friends and his sons at the Kokanee Glacier in British Columbia every year for over a decade. In 1995, he took up snowboarding and enjoyed most of the major areas in Idaho, especially Tamarack Resort and Brundage Mountain Resort near his home in McCall, Idaho. While on a tour of South America, he snowboarded (while his second wife skied) at Valle Nevado in Chile. His love of the terrain park for snowboarders led him to enter competitions, and he was 2007-08 Idaho State Champion in Superpipe for his age division (Methuselah!). He was a nationally ranked Methuselah Division snowboarder in Slopestyle and Superpipe. Ron loved snowboarding so much that he bought lots of new boards, and his friends call him the \"Ron Klimko doll, wind him up and he buys a snowboard.\" Ron died on March 18, 2012 at his favorite ski resort, Brundage Mountain in McCall, Idaho. He left this earth just as he always said he wanted to go: he had finished a beer or two with his wife and son Chris, was laughing and talking with friends, having done a couple of snowboard runs the day before, left for the car and then turned back for his credit card. While in the bar talking with the area manager, he collapsed suddenly and apparently without pain. Perhaps he is climbing and snowboarding the highest peaks of all now. Ron seemed to live every moment as if it were his last with an unmatched passion for music, running, biking, snowboarding, climbing and every other thing he could do. In his prime he had the energy of a light beam and his wit and love of people was infectious and endearing to all who knew him until the end. The Ronald J.

A key example of this phenomenon is the spin–orbit interaction leading to shifts in an electron's atomic energy levels, due to electromagnetic interaction between the electron's magnetic dipole, its orbital motion, and the electrostatic field of the positively charged nucleus. This phenomenon is detectable as a splitting of spectral lines, which can be thought of as a Zeeman effect product of two relativistic effects: the apparent magnetic field seen from the electron perspective and the magnetic moment of the electron associated to its intrinsic spin. A similar effect, due to the relationship between angular momentum and the strong nuclear force, occurs for protons and neutrons moving inside the nucleus, leading to a shift in their energy levels in the nucleus shell model. In the field of spintronics, spin–orbit effects for electrons in semiconductors and other materials are explored for technological applications. The spin–orbit interaction is one cause of magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the spin Hall effect. For atoms, energy level split produced by the spin-orbit interaction is usually of the same order in size to the relativistic corrections to the kinetic energy and the zitterbewegung effect. The addition of these three corrections is known as the fine structure. Note that the spin-orbit effect is due to the electrostatic field of the electron and not the magnetic field created by its orbit. The interaction between the magnetic field created by the electron and the magnetic moment of the nucleus is a slighter correction to the energy levels known as the hyperfine structure.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Paul Meany (born July 2, 1976) is the lead singer and keyboardist for the indie band Mutemath.

An example of this process is where the anteroposterior axis (the axis drawn between the head and tail end of an embryo) becomes longer as the lateral tissues (those that make up the left and right sides of the embryo) move in towards the dorsal midline (the middle of the back of the animal). This process plays a crucial role in shaping the body plan during embryogenesis and occurs during gastrulation, neurulation, axis elongation, and organogenesis in both vertebrate and invertebrate embryos. In chordate animals, this process is utilized within a vast population of cells; from the smaller populations in the notochord of the sea squirt (ascidian) to the larger populations of the dorsal mesoderm and neural ectoderm of frogs (Xenopus) and fish. Many characteristics of convergent extension are conserved in the teleost fish, the bird, and very likely within mammals at the molecular, cellular, and tissue level. Convergent extension has been primarily studied in frogs and fish due to their large embryo size and their development outside of a maternal host (in egg clutches in the water, as opposed to in a uterus). Within frogs and fish, however, there exist fundamental differences in how convergent extension is achieved. Frog embryogenesis utilizes cell rearrangement as the sole player of this process. Fish, on the other hand, utilize both cell rearrangement as well as directed migration (Fig. 1) . Cellular rearrangement is the process by which individual cells of a tissue rearrange to reshape the tissue as a whole, while cellular migration is the directed movement of a singular cell or small group of cells across a substrate such as a membrane or tissue. Frog (Xenopus), as well as other amphibian, gastrulation serves as an excellent example of the role of convergent extension in embryogenesis. During gastrulation in frogs, the driving force of convergent extension is the morphogenic activity of the presumptive dorsal mesodermal cells; this activity is driven by the mesenchymal cells that lie beneath the presumptive mesodermal and neural tissues. These tissues exist within the involuting marginal zone (IMZ) of the embryo which lies between the vegetal endoderm and the posterior neural tissue. The IMZ is integral to gastrulation and R. Keller et al. eloquently exemplify the importance of convergent extension in Xenopus gastrulation. “…the IMZ, true to its name, involutes or rolls over the blastoporal lip and turns inside out. As it involutes, it converges along the mediolateral axis and extends along the future anterior-posterior axis of the notochordal and somitic mesoderm. Convergence and extension of these tissues squeezes the blastopore shut and simultaneously elongate the body axis. Elongation continues through the neurula and tailbud stages…As these involuted dorsal mesodermal tissues converge and extend on the inside of the gastrula, the presumptive posterior neural tissue converges and extends on the outside of the embryo, parallel to the underlying mesoderm, and then rolls up to form the neural tube, which later forms the hindbrain and spinal cord of the central nervous system\". Should convergent extension be interrupted or incomplete, the resulting organism will have a short anteroposterior axis, wide notochord, and broad, open neural tube. The cellular signals required for convergent extension are not fully understood, however, it is known that the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role,.   Current research is shedding light on the cellular mechanisms of convergent extension and recently the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway was implicated in regulating the cell polarity of the factors involved in convergent extension. This is an interesting development as the PCP pathway is an integral and well-studied pathway in flies, but has classically been thought to be unemployed by vertebrates. In addition to the non-canonical Wnt and PCP pathways involvement in convergent extension, the down-regulation of certain cell-cell adhesion molecules, such as C-cadherin and fibronectin/integrin interactions, may also play a role. Reduction of the activity of these cell-cell adhesion molecules allows for cells undergoing convergent extension to move more freely. Consistent with a role for a reduction of cell-cell adhesion in convergent extension, when cell-cell adhesion is not reduced, convergent extension cannot occur.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"War Times is a real-time strategy computer game released in 2004.

It is the largest of the Japanese new religions and holds the largest membership among Nichiren Buddhist groups. \"The Gakkai\" bases its teachings on Nichiren's interpretation of the Lotus Sutra and places chanting \"Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō\" at the center of devotional practice. The organization promotes its goals as supporting \"peace, culture, and education\". The movement was founded by educators Makiguchi and Toda on 18 November 1930, and held its inaugural meeting in 1937. It was disbanded during World War II when much of the leadership was imprisoned on the Peace Preservation Law violations and charges of lèse-majesté. After the war it expanded from a pre-war estimate of 3,000 members to a claimed total of 750,000 households in 1958 through explosive recruitment, which shocked the Japanese establishment and media. Further expansion of the movement was led by its third president Daisaku Ikeda. According to its own account, it has 12 million members in 192 countries and territories around the world. While Ikeda has been successful in moving the group toward mainstream acceptance, it is still widely viewed with suspicion in Japan and has found itself embroiled in public controversies, especially in the first three decades following World War II.

Although Ikeda and his successor, Einosuke Akiya, have gone to great lengths to improve the movement's public image, suspicion remains. Soka Gakkai's political involvement through the organ of the Komeito, a political party founded by the Soka Gakkai, and the near godlike reverence that members have for President Ikeda have tended to perpetuate public distrust. Although it has been subjected to a generalized suspicion toward Eastern religious movements in the United States, Europe, and South America, the movement's history outside of Japan has been tranquil by comparison to its Japanese history.\"   From 1952 to 1991, it shared an association with the Nichiren Shōshū Buddhist sect.

It was released on November 25, 2002, by Epic Records. Prior to its release, Lopez began a high-profile relationship with director and actor Ben Affleck and a media circus ensued. Her relationship with Affleck served as her main inspiration for the album, which is dedicated to him. Initially scheduled to be released the following year, This Is Me... Thens release date was quickly pushed forward after its lead single, the notorious \"Jenny from the Block\", was leaked online. For the album's recording, Lopez once again recruited Cory Rooney, Troy Oliver and Dan Shea, all of whom she had worked with on her previous albums. She decided to shift away from a pure dance-pop to more of a contemporary R&B and soul sound, influenced by the soul music she grew up listening to. The record's throwback material was integrated with mainstream hip-hop and pop music. During its production, Lopez was influenced by the works of Michael Jackson, Luther Vandross and Stevie Wonder among others. This Is Me... Then received mixed reviews from music critics. Some praised its musical direction, deeming it her strongest album to date, whilst others criticized its production and Lopez's vocal performance. The album went on to achieve commercial success, reaching number two in the United States where it has sold 2.6 million copies. The album's lead single, \"Jenny from the Block\" featuring Styles P and Jadakiss of The LOX, became a worldwide hit, peaking at three in the United States. However, its release was followed by the notoriety of its music video, which featured Affleck. The single has since been used as a nickname for Lopez in the media, known as one of her signature songs. The album's second single \"All I Have\" featuring rapper LL Cool J was also a hit, peaking at number one in the United States. \"I'm Glad\", the third single, performed moderately. The single's music video was met with critical acclaim, but caused controversy for recreating scenes from the 1983 film Flashdance. Sony and Lopez were sued over this, but the lawsuit was dismissed. This Is Me... Then spawned a fourth single entitled \"Baby I Love U!\" which failed to chart in most regions.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The 'USAT Meigs' (sometimes incorrectly called USS Meigs) was a United States Army transport ship that was built in 1921 and sunk in Darwin Harbour in the first Japanese air raid against the Australia mainland on 19 February 1942.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Jeune Afrique is a French-language pan-African weekly news magazine, founded in 1960 in Tunis and subsequently published in Paris.

The extent to which Sopranos character Christopher Moltisanti mixes confidential and personal information about the Soprano mob family into the story elements of Cleaver is the focal point throughout its development. After the project eventually materializes, Cleaver can be categorized as a direct-to-DVD mafia-slasher film, described alternately as \"Saw meets the Godfather II\", \"the Ring meets The Godfather\", and \"a story about a young man who goes to pieces and then manages to pull himself together again\". Several characters are credited for their involvement in the project. The screenplay was written by [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Christopher Moltisanti's friends and associates|J. T.
