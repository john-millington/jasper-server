The governing Ontario Liberal Party led by Premier David Peterson was unexpectedly defeated. Although the Peterson government was very popular, he was accused of opportunism in calling an election just three years into his mandate. In a shocking upset, the New Democratic Party, led by Bob Rae, won a majority government. This marked the first time the NDP had won government east of Manitoba, and to date the only time the NDP formed the government in Ontario. The NDP had not expected to come close to winning power; indeed, Rae had already made plans to retire from politics after the election. However, the NDP managed to take many seats in the Greater Toronto Area (Rae himself represented York South, in Metro Toronto) from the Liberals. They also did better than ever before (or in some cases, since) in many other cities and rural areas. The NDP finished only five points ahead of the Liberals in the popular vote, but due to the nature of the first-past-the-post electoral system, which ignores the popular vote and awards power based on the number of ridings won, the NDP's gains in the GTA decimated the Liberal caucus. The Liberals lost 59 seats, the worst defeat in their history and the second-worst defeat for a governing party in Ontario. Peterson himself was heavily defeated in London Centre by NDP challenger Marion Boyd, losing by 8,200 votes—one of the few times a provincial premier has lost their own seat. Although Mike Harris's Progressive Conservative Party was unable to overcome voter distrust of the federal Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney, his party did manage to make a net gain of four seats. Although Harris was from northern Ontario, the Tories were particularly weak in that region, placing fourth, behind the Liberals, NDP and the right-wing, Confederation of Regions Party (CoR) in six northern Ontario ridings (Algoma, Cochrane South, Nickel Belt, Sudbury, Sudbury East and Sault Ste. Marie). The CoR Party also placed ahead of the PC Party in the Renfrew North and Cornwall ridings in eastern Ontario. Although they received only 1.9% of the vote provincewide, they managed 7.8% in the 33 ridings in which they actually fielded a candidate. The Green Party of Ontario placed third, ahead of the NDP, in Parry Sound riding, where former Liberal leadership candidate Richard Thomas was the party's candidate.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The 14th Lok Sabha (17 May 2004 – 18 May 2009) was convened after the Indian general election, 2004 held in four phases during 20 April – 10 May 2004, which led to the formation of First Manmohan Singh ministry (2004–2009).

PAP ventilation is also commonly used for those who are critically ill in hospital with respiratory failure, in newborn infants (neonates), and for the prevention and treatment of atelectasis in patients with difficulty taking deep breaths. In these patients, PAP ventilation can prevent the need for tracheal intubation, or allow earlier extubation. Sometimes patients with neuromuscular diseases use this variety of ventilation as well. CPAP is an acronym for \"continuous positive airway pressure\", which was developed by Dr. George Gregory and colleagues in the neonatal intensive care unit at the University of California, San Francisco. A variation of the PAP system was developed by Professor Colin Sullivan at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, Australia, in 1981. The main difference between BiPAP and CPAP machines is that BiPAP machines have two pressure settings: the prescribed pressure for inhalation (ipap), and a lower pressure for exhalation (epap). The dual settings allow the patient to get more air in and out of their lungs.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"TREMEC is a manufacturer of automobile transmissions and drivetrain components, and is best known for their performance line of iconic manual transmissions.

The apparently paradoxical nature of the statement comes from the way it is usually stated in natural language. It seems counterintuitive both that there could be a person who is causing the others to drink, or that there could be a person such that all through the night that one person were always the last to drink. The first objection comes from confusing formal \"if then\" statements with causation (see Correlation does not imply causation or Relevance logic for logics which demand relevant relationships between premise and consequent, unlike classical logic assumed here). The formal statement of the theorem is timeless, eliminating the second objection because the person the statement holds true for at one instant is not necessarily the same person it holds true for at any other instant. The formal statement of the theorem is where D is an arbitrary predicate and P is an arbitrary nonempty set.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Justicia lanstyakii is a plant native of Cerrado vegetation of Brazil.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Frederik Vanderbiest (born 10 October 1977 in Vilvoorde, Belgium) is a former Belgian footballer and football manager who last was in charge of Lierse playing in the Belgian First Division B.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"State Route 260 (SR 260) is a very short west-east state highway located in the northern part of the U.S. state of Georgia.

Rooms can be mixed or single-sex, and private rooms may also be available. Hostels are often cheaper for both the operator and occupants; many hostels have long-term residents whom they employ as desk agents or housekeeping staff in exchange for experience or discounted accommodation. In a few countries, such as the UK, Ireland, India and Australia, the word hostel sometimes also refers to establishments providing longer-term accommodation. In India, Pakistan and South Africa, hostel also refers to boarding schools or student dormitories in resident colleges and universities. In other parts of the world, the word hostel mainly refers to properties offering shared accommodation to travellers or backpackers. Within the \"traveler\" category, another distinction can be drawn between hostels that are members of Hostelling International (HI), a UK-based, non-profit organisation encouraging outdoor activities and cultural exchange for the young (formerly the IYHA), and independently operated hostels. Backpackers' Hostels began in Australia and New Zealand and differ from hostels by being open during the day time, often abbreviated to just \"Backpackers.\" In New Zealand, the BBH network was the first network of 'modern day' backpacker hostel, catering to independent travellers since 1985.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Samantha Strong (born June 9, 1967) is an American former pornographic actress.

The Pequot and Mohegan were formerly a single group, but the Mohegan split off in the 17th century as the Pequot came to control much of present-day Connecticut. Simmering tensions with the New England Colonies led to the Pequot War of 1634–1638, which dramatically reduced the population and influence of the Pequot; many members were killed, enslaved, or dispersed. Small numbers of Pequot remained in Connecticut, receiving two reservations, at Mashantucket in 1666 and at the Pawcatuck River in 1683; others lived in other areas and with other tribes. In the 18th century, some Christian Pequot joined members of several other peoples to form the Brothertown Indians. They relocated to western New York in the 19th century and later to Wisconsin.

Those involved can include parties such as linguists, cultural or community groups, or governments. Some argue for a distinction between language revival (the resurrection of a dead language with no existing native speakers) and language revitalization (the rescue of a \"dying\" language). It has been pointed out that there has only been one successful instance of a complete language revival, that of the Hebrew language, creating a new generation of native speakers without any pre-existing native speakers as a model. Languages targeted for language revitalization include those whose use and prominence is severely limited. Sometimes various tactics of language revitalization can even be used to try to revive extinct languages. Though the goals of language revitalization vary greatly from case to case, they typically involve attempting to expand the number of speakers and use of a language, or trying to maintain the current level of use to protect the language from extinction or language death. Reasons for revitalization vary. In recent times alone, it is estimated that more than 2000 languages have already become extinct. The UN estimates that more than half of the languages spoken today have fewer than 10,000 speakers and that a quarter have fewer than 1,000 speakers and that, unless there are some efforts to maintain them, over the next hundred years most of these will become extinct. These figures are often cited as reasons why language revitalization is necessary to preserve linguistic diversity. Culture and identity are also frequently cited reasons for language revitalization, when a language is perceived as a unique \"cultural treasure.\" A community often sees language as a unique part of their culture, connecting them with their ancestors or with the land, making up an essential part of their history and self-image. Language revitalization is also closely tied to the linguistic field of language documentation. In this field, linguists attempt to create full records of a language's grammar, vocabulary, and linguistic features. This practice can often lead to more concern for the revitalization of a specific language on study. Furthermore, the task of documentation is often taken on with the goal of revitalization in mind.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Vintage Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to two-year-old horses.

It states that when the prices of two substitute goods, such as high and low grades of the same product, are both increased by a fixed per-unit amount such as a transportation cost or a lump-sum tax, consumption will shift toward the higher-grade product. This is true because the added per-unit amount decreases the relative price of the higher-grade product. Suppose, for example, that high-grade coffee beans are $3/pound and low-grade beans $1.50/pound; in this example, high-grade beans cost twice as much as low-grade beans. Now add a per-pound international shipping cost of $1. The effective prices are now $4 and $2.50; high-grade beans now cost only 1.6 times as much as low-grade beans. This reduced ratio of difference will induce distant coffee-buyers to now choose a higher ratio of high-to-low grade beans than local coffee-buyers. (Prices are illustrative only). The effect has been studied as it applies to illegal drugs and it has been shown that the potency of marijuana increased in response to higher enforcement budgets, and there was a similar effect for alcohol in the U.S. during Prohibition.

The Navarre–Anderson Trading Post is just outside the city limits of Monroe. It is commonly mentioned as being in Monroe because of its mailing address and since Monroe is its closest city. In actuality, the trading post is in the very far western corner of Frenchtown Charter Township just west of Custer Airport (as seen on the bottom corner of the map linked below) and therefore falls under their jurisdiction.

It was listed as a Michigan Historic Site on June 16, 1972 and also listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 31, 1972. The main building on the complex dates back to 1789, and is claimed to be the oldest surviving wooden residential building in the state. However, architectural analyses of the Biddle and McGulpin houses on Mackinac Island indicate they could date back as far as 1780. The Navarre–Anderson complex was established by the early French settlers Francois Navarre and John Anderson, who were among the first to settle the area of present-day Monroe. In addition to the main building, which also served as a house, the cookhouse building was built in 1810. The original barn is no longer standing, but a 1790s replica was built on the complex.

Under his leadership the School developed an international reputation and was associated with the flourishing of Glasgow Style and the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his circle. Newbery helped commission Mackintosh as architect for the now famous School of Art building and was actively involved in its design. Born in Devon on 15 May 1855 to a shoemaker and his wife, Newbery went to school in Bridport, Dorset where he qualified as a teacher, and later as an art master. While working and studying in London he won an 'Art Master in Training' scholarship in 1881. At the Glasgow School of Art he was a vigorous and innovative headmaster. He gave teaching posts to practising artists rather than relying on certificated art masters. He established an art club allowing students to branch out from the national art school course, and employed several women teachers, unlike most other UK art schools of the time. Newbery established craft workshops and introduced embroidery classes where his wife, Jessie Newbery, played an important part. Overall, he wanted students to have a strong training in traditional techniques, while developing their unique individual talent. His own painting was associated with the Glasgow Boys' and he was close to James Guthrie and John Lavery. Under Francis Newbery's direction the School's prestige grew, both internationally and at home. His reputation as a successful director was enhanced by the high profile of various Glasgow artists of the 1890s and early 20th century whose development he had fostered. After retiring he returned to Dorset and lived with his wife in Corfe Castle.

The larvae feed on termites which they subdue by secreting an aggressive allomone via farting . The first instar approaches termites and waves the tip of its abdomen near the termites' head and farts. The termite becomes immobile after 1 to 3 minutes, and completely paralysed very soon after this, although it may live for up to 3 hours. The berothid then feeds on the paralyzed prey. The later instars feed in a similar manner and are able to paralyze multiple termites with a single fart. Contact between the termite and the berothid is not necessary for subduing due to the spread of flatus, and other insects present are not affected by the allomone. Adult berothid lacewings are not predatory and feed on nectar like most lacewings. However, female berothids lay egg clusters on logs, stumps or trees infested with termites.

It is intended to protect their contents from theft, unauthorized use, fire, natural disasters, and other threats, much like a safe. Unlike safes, vaults are an integral part of the building within which they are built, using armored walls and a tightly fashioned door closed with a complex lock. Historically, strongrooms were built in the basement of a bank where the ceilings were vaulted, hence the name. Modern bank vaults typically contain many safe deposit boxes, as well as places for teller cash drawers, and other valuable assets of the bank or its customers. They are also common in other buildings where valuables are kept such as post offices, grand hotels, rare book libraries and certain government ministries. Vault technology developed in a type of arms race with bank robbers. As burglars came up with new ways to break into vaults, vault makers found new ways to foil them. Modern vaults may be armed with a wide array of alarms and anti-theft devices. Some nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century vaults were built so well that today they are almost impossible to destroy. These older vaults were typically made with steel-reinforced concrete. The walls were usually at least 1 ft (0.3 m) thick, and the door itself was typically 3.5 ft (1.1 m) thick. Total weight ran into the hundreds of tons (see the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland). Today vaults are made with thinner, lighter materials that, while still secure, are easier to dismantle than their earlier counterparts.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Cup of Jamshid (, jām-e Jam) is a cup of divination, which in Persian mythology was long possessed by the rulers of ancient Greater Iran.

As mentioned by Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda, it was believed that all seven heavens of the universe could be observed by looking into it (از هفت فلک در او مشاهده و معاینه کردی). It was believed to have been discovered in Persepolis in ancient times. The whole world was said to be reflected in it, and divinations within the cup were said to reveal deep truths.

For instance, the Norker Bottom section was inhabited by people from the villages of Norka, Kukkus and Huck, while the Franker Bottom section housed people from Frank, Balzer and Beideck. Since many of the immigrants were farmers, many people from the South Bottoms spent May through November working in the sugar beet fields in central Nebraska.

First these areas were part of the Saint Petersburg Governorate. Vyborg Governorate was established in 1744 when Sweden ceded control of parts of Kymmenegård and Nyslott County by the Treaty of Åbo. In Sweden and Finland the governorate was also known as Old Finland (, ), and between 1802 and 1812 it was named the \"Finland Governorate\". During the Napoleonic Wars, the Kingdom of Sweden had allied itself with the Russian Empire, United Kingdom and the other parties against Napoleonic France. However, following the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, Russia made peace with France. In 1808, and supported by France, Russia successfully challenged the Swedish control over Finland in the Finnish War. In the Treaty of Fredrikshamn on September 17, 1809 Sweden was obliged to cede all its territory in Finland, east of the Torne River, to Russia. The ceded territories became a part of the Russian Empire and was reconstituted into the Grand Duchy of Finland, with the Russian Tsar as Grand Duke. In 1812 the area of Vyborg Governorate was transferred from Russia proper to the grand duchy and established as Viipuri Province. The transfer, announced by Tsar Alexander I just before Christmas, on December 23, 1811 O.S.

An ash warning for aircraft was distributed by the Darwin office of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology on 19 October, by which time a second new vent had appeared. Ash was apparently drifting to the north-west on 19 October and had contaminated some village water supplies. Eruptions continued into November 2005, although less violently. By January 2006, the main activity was limited to volumes of white vapour being discharged from the new vents. Garbuna is less than 20 km to the west of Kimbe, the main urban centre of West New Britain and the location of an important palm oil industry. In August 2002, the Pago volcano to the east of Kimbe erupted and caused 12,000 people to seek refuge in care centres. The Hoskins airport was closed for some time due to ash falls.

Manchester was late in commissioning a war memorial compared to most British towns and cities—the city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922. The committee quickly raised £10,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial. The preferred site in Albert Square required the removal and relocation of several statues, and was opposed by the city's artistic community. The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a stone cross commemorating the former St Peter's Church. Negotiations to move the cross were unsuccessful and the cenotaph was built with the cross in situ. The choice of architect was initially to be decided by open competition, but the committee was criticised in the local press when it reserved the right to overrule the result. It abandoned the competition and approached Lutyens, who produced a variation of his design for his cenotaph in London. The memorial consists of a central cenotaph and a Stone of Remembrance flanked by twin obelisks, all features characteristic of Lutyens' works. The cenotaph is topped by an effigy of a fallen soldier and decorated with relief carvings of the imperial crown, Manchester's coat of arms and inscriptions commemorating the dead. The structures, based on classical architecture, use abstract, ecumenical shapes rather than overt religious symbolism. The memorial was unveiled on 12 July 1924 by the Earl of Derby, assisted by Mrs Bingle, a local resident whose three sons had died in the war. It cost £6,940 and the remaining funds were used to provide hospital beds. In 2014, Manchester City Council dismantled the memorial and reconstructed it at the northwest corner of St Peter's Square next to Manchester Town Hall to make room for the expanded Metrolink tram network. It is a grade II* listed structure and in 2015, Historic England recognised Manchester Cenotaph as part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Nancy Carole Tyler (April 9, 1939&ndash;May 9, 1965) was a personal secretary to Bobby Baker.

Its story, which follows themes of abandonment and personal isolation, explores Pink, a character whom Waters modeled after himself and the band's original leader Syd Barrett. Pink's life begins with the loss of his father during the Second World War, and continues with abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother, and the breakdown of his marriage; all contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by a metaphorical wall. The band, who were then struggling with personal and financial difficulties, supported the idea. Waters enlisted an outside collaborator, Canadian producer Bob Ezrin, due to his need for somebody who he felt was \"musically and intellectually\" similar to himself, as well as a helping hand for the cumbersome amount of material that was written. Recording lasted from December 1978 to November 1979, with stops in France, England, New York, and Los Angeles. Waters' song \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" became the band's first and only chart-topper when released as the album's lead single. Two songs co-written by guitarist David Gilmour, \"Run Like Hell\" and \"Comfortably Numb\", were also issued as singles. The Wall was the last studio album released with the 11-year-spanning line-up of Waters, Gilmour, keyboardist Rick Wright, and drummer Nick Mason. Wright was fired from the band by Waters during its production, but stayed as a salaried musician, performing with Pink Floyd on their subsequent live tour. The live performances, which were later released as a live album, featured elaborate theatrical effects. Some of the album's themes would be continued in the band's next album, The Final Cut (1983), which contained some outtakes from The Wall. By 1999, the album had sold over 23 million RIAA-certified units (11.5 million albums), making it the third-highest certified album in the US.

Thus the town of Kungur was founded. Yelizarov is also known for taking a census of the Stroganovs' estates in 1647, by order of Alexis I.

After his father's death in 1361, he ruled the principality alone, except for a few possessions at Osterode and Herzberg, which he ceded to his brother Frederick. He lived alone at Salzderhelden Castle in Einbeck, which is why he was nicknamed \"Duke of Salt\". He has been praised as a lover of history and science. Nevertheless, highway robbery flourished during his rule, and he may even have engaged in it himself, which got him into a dispute with his neighbours. On 28 Jun 1361, he shared a letter of tribute from the City of Brunswick with his brother John, but later that year, he got into a feud with Count Otto of Waldeck and his son Henry. In 1362, Albert and John were captured during the battle at Arnoldshausen. They were only released after they had sworn Urfehde. The territories of Landgrave Frederick III of Thuringia were particularly hard hit by the forays of Albert and his vassals. After several unsuccessful warnings, Frederick III attacked Grubenhagen in 1365 with what was then considered a major army. It has been claimed that the army numbered over eighteen thousand men. They made camp before Einbeck and Salzderhelden. However, after a few months, they had to leave without having accomplished anything. The account of this attack contains the first mention of a gun in Brunswick (diz waz die erste buchse, dy yn dessin landin vernommen wart). The Landgrave devastated towns and villages, and captured and tore down the robber castles of several of Albert's vassals and thereby forced him to sue for peace. Albert soon broke the peace again, the Landgrave devastated his country again, and Albert had to wait in Eisenach until the dispute was arbitrated. Due to these feuds, Albert was short of money and had to pledge some of his possessions. For example, in 1365 he pledged the bailiwick of Hamelin to Coun John of Spigelbert and in 1372, the city of Hamelin itself to Count Otto of Schaumburg and in 1370, to the City Council of Brunswick, his share of the precincts Altewiek and Sack, the judiciary, the Jewish tax and the mills of Brunswick. In 1381, he sold several villages located around Einbeck for 300 Rhenish florins to the Bishop of Hildesheim. Albert was married with Agnes, daughter of Duke Magnus with the chain of Brunswick.

Lépine was born Gamil Rodrigue Liass Gharbi in Montreal, the son of a Canadian nurse and an Algerian businessman. His father was abusive and contemptuous of women. After his parents separated when he was seven, his mother returned to nursing to support her children. Lépine and his younger sister lived with other families, seeing their mother on weekends. Lépine was considered bright but withdrawn and having difficulties with peer and family relationships. He changed his name to Marc Lépine at the age of 14 giving as the reason his hatred of his father. Lépine's application to the Canadian Forces was rejected, and in 1982 he began a science program at a college, switching to a more technical program after one year. In 1986, he dropped out of the course in his final term, and was subsequently fired from his job at a hospital due to his poor attitude. He began a computer programming course in 1988, and again abandoned it before completion. Lépine twice applied for admission to the École Polytechnique, but lacked two required compulsory courses. After several months of planning, Lépine entered the École Polytechnique de Montréal, on the afternoon of December 6, 1989. He had long complained about women working in non-traditional jobs, and after separating men and women in a classroom, he shot the women, claiming that he was fighting feminism. He then moved into other parts of the building, only targeting the women in classrooms he went to, before killing himself. His suicide note blamed feminists for ruining his life. Lépine's actions have been variously ascribed to psychiatric diagnoses such as personality disorder, psychosis, or attachment disorder, or societal factors such as poverty, isolation, powerlessness, and violence in the media. The massacre is regarded by criminologists as an example of a hate crime against women, and by feminists and government officials as misogynist attack and an example of the larger issue of violence against women.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Battle of the Network Stars is a series of competitions in which television stars from ABC, CBS, and NBC would compete in various sporting events.

Intergalactic Computer Network or Galactic Network was a computer networking concept similar to today's Internet. J.C.R. Licklider, the first director of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at The Pentagon's ARPA, used the term in the early 1960s to refer to a networking system he “imagined as an electronic commons open to all, ‘the main and essential medium of informational interaction for governments, institutions, corporations, and individuals.’” An office memorandum he sent to his colleagues in 1963 was addressed to \"Members and Affiliates of the Intergalactic Computer Network\". As head of IPTO from 1962 to 1964, “Licklider initiated three of the most important developments in information technology: the creation of computer science departments at several major universities, time-sharing, and networking.” By the late 1960s, his promotion of the concept had inspired a primitive version of his vision called ARPANET, which expanded into a network of networks in the 1970s that became the Internet.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Peter Ndlovu (born 25 February 1973) is a Zimbabwean former professional footballer and is currently the Team Manager at Mamelodi Sundowns F.C. a Premier Soccer League club in South Africa.
