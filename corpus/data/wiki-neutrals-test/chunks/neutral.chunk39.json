AC Propulsion added the AC-150 drivetrain, a single-speed electric system with an overall gear ratio of 9:1.

Only three were built, one of which is owned by the company itself, one by Gruber Power Services, a company that specializes in Tesla Roadster repair, and one privately. The drivetrain, however, was used in many other vehicles. Because the car recharges its batteries when the throttle is released — slowing sharply as energy is recaptured — it can be driven hard using only the accelerator pedal.

Hasselt, Limburg, 21 Jan., 1817; d. Leuven, 17 Aug., 1891) was a professor of law at the Catholic University of Leuven and a minister in the Belgian Government. He first performed duties in the magistracy and the administration of Limburg, but was occupied with juridical works on penal law. When dismissed by the Liberal (anti-clerical) ministry, the University of Leuven appointed him in 1848 to the chair of criminal law. In 1863 he was elected to Parliament. Although he achieved his fame in his chosen field of penal law, his writings covered varied points of history and social science, as was evidenced by the fact that in 1886 the national jury of social sciences awarded him the prize. In penal matters he began with commentaries on the penal code and devoted himself especially to the reform of the penal procedure which he advocated while he was minister. He had conceived the vast plan of a history of criminal law, but realized only a part of it. The first part, which met with considerable success, dealt with Brahminical India, Egypt, and Judea, and contained a \"Penal Code of the Pentateuch\". He published a work on the penal law of the Athenian Republic. Considering the Roman period as sufficiently well-known, he took up the Frankish period, which he was unable to finish. He aroused controversy by advocating the abolition of the death penalty, which his influence helped bring about in Belgium. While not rejecting it as absolutely unlawful, Thonissen considered it useless in the social condition of the time. He showed a marked preference for national political history, his principal work on the subject being the History of the Reign of Leopold I. He also published biographies of prominent Belgians such as Félix de Mérode. He had been impressed by the Revolution of 1848 which determined his career and he devoted himself to a laborious study of innovating systems, especially of the Utopian Socialists - St. Simon, Fourier, Cabet, Robert Owen, Louis Blanc, and others, being led eventually to write a history of Socialism from ancient times to 1852. These works and many others secured his admission to the Royal Academy of Belgium and the Institut de France; he was commissioned by the former institution to write the volume devoted to its centenary (1872).","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Symphony No. 6 by Robert Simpson was completed in 1977 and dedicated to the renowned gynaecologist Ian Craft. It was commissioned by the London Philharmonic Orchestra who gave the premiere under Sir Charles Groves in a performance broadcast 8 April 1980. Ian Craft, the symphony dedicatee, suggested that the emergence of life from a fertilized cell could be paralleled in symphonic form, with motives developing by thematic metamorphosis. This idea appealed to Simpson who took it even further by dividing the one-movement work into two parts: the first a steady build up to a large climax which symbolises birth, the second representing the rapid growth of the newborn individual. At the beginning, two germinal elements are exposed; static and mobile. These include triadic shapes in the violins, and a chord which has potential to open out into a chain of fifths which Simpson likened to a DNA molecule. The material is always growing and proliferating into polyphonic lines, canons, inversions and retrogrades which representing cells dividing, multiplying and grouping. Eventually a central climax is reached after graphical ‘contractions’ from the orchestra; this represents the moment of birth and brings about a sense of release. The second half of the work symbolises the rapid development of the newborn and suggests the sequence of an intermezzo, scherzo and finale. After a long oboe melody, there is a quiet fugue before a triumphant and energetic conclusion. The work ends triadically (an unusual occurrence in Simpson’s music) on a resounding D major chord.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Cristian Roig Mauri (born 23 July 1977) is a former Andorran international footballer.

They are members of the Eastern Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The Bills franchise was formed in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL), before joining the NFL as part of the AFL-NFL merger of 1970. There have been 19 head coaches for the Bills franchise. Buster Ramsey became the first head coach of the Buffalo Bills in 1960, serving for two seasons before being fired by Bills owner Ralph Wilson after the 1961 season. In terms of tenure, Marv Levy has coached more games (182) and seasons (12) than any other coach in franchise history. He coached the Bills to four straight AFC Championships from 1990–1993, but failed to lead the team to a victory in the Super Bowl. One of Levy's predecessors, Lou Saban, who coached the team on two separate occasions, led the team to the victories in the AFL championship in 1964 and 1965. Three Bills coaches—Saban, Levy and Chuck Knox—have been named coach of the year by at least one major news organization. Levy and Jim Ringo are the only Bills coaches to have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. There have been six \"interim\" head coaches in Bills history. First, in 1968, head coach Joe Collier was fired two games into the season and replaced by Bills personnel director Harvey Johnson. Johnson did not serve as head coach the following season. Then, five games into the 1976 season, Saban unexpectedly resigned as head coach. He was replaced by Ringo, the team's offensive line coach. Ringo returned to coach the team again in the 1977 season. In October 1985, Kay Stephenson was fired and replaced by assistant head coach Hank Bullough. Just over a year later, Bullough was himself fired and replaced by Marv Levy, who had previously served as coach of the Kansas City Chiefs. Levy would then serve as Bills head coach for the next 12 seasons. In 2016, Anthony Lynn replaced Rex Ryan for the final game of the season. Following Levy's retirement, the Bills experienced limited success under a series of successive head coaches. Wade Phillips, the Bills defensive coordinator for the last three years under Levy, took over head coaching duties for the 1998 season. Phillips served as head coach for three seasons, making the playoffs in his first two (He was the last coach to lead the Bills to the playoffs until Sean McDermott became coach in 2017). After Phillips' departure following the 2000 season, Gregg Williams was named head coach. Williams served as coach for three seasons. At the end of the 2003 season, Williams' contract was not renewed. Mike Mularkey was named as the new head coach for the 2004 season, leading the Bills to their first winning season since 1999. The Bills experienced less success under Mularkey during 2005, and Mularkey resigned as head coach at the completion of the 2005 season. The Bills then named Dick Jauron as their head coach for the 2006 season. Jauron was the first coach since Phillips' dismissal with prior head coaching experience, having previously served as head coach of the Chicago Bears and interim head coach of the Detroit Lions. Jauron coached the Bills to three consecutive 7–9 seasons before being fired on November 17, 2009, nine games into the 2009 season. On January 19, 2010, the Bills named Chan Gailey as their next head coach; Gailey was fired on December 31, 2012. In January 2013, Doug Marrone was appointed. He exercised his option to leave in January 2015 following the change of ownership to Kim and Terrence Pegula and was replaced by Rex Ryan. Rex Ryan was fired from the team on December 27, 2016.

Some shortwave broadband antennas can even be used on the whole shortwave radio spectrum (1.6-30 MHz) which consist of the upper part of medium frequency (1.6-3 MHz) and the whole of high frequency (3-30 MHz). A true shortwave broadband antenna will work continuously across most of, if not all of the shortwave spectrum with good radiation efficiency and minimal compromise of the radiation pattern. At the lower shortwave frequencies e.g. 1.8 MHz, the antennas need to be physically large to enable good coupling to \"space\" and hence efficient radiation. As an example, at 5 MHz a half wave dipole antenna is around 30 meter in length and 2 MHz it is 75 meter long. Half wave horisontal dipoles are efficient radiators, if they are high above ground in terms of electromagnetic waves wavelengths - if not then half wave horisontal dipoles are inefficient radiators. Half wave dipoles are narrow band (only work over a very small frequency range) before serious impedance mismatch occurs. This mismatch can be accommodated using an antenna tuner but these add to costs and modern shortwave communication often uses frequency hopping techniques. Even automatic antenna tuners will not work with frequency hopping signals. Broadband shortwave base antennas traditionally fall into two main categories: also inexpensive. Previous solutions include the Barker Williamson folded dipole, the Australian traveling-wave antenna and other designs by Guertler etc. Many \"broadband\" designs have also been offered by the Amateur Radio community but these are generally not true broadband antennas as they only work well (without an antenna tuner) in the harmonically related Amateur bands.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Veal School near Roopville, Georgia was built in 1900 and expanded in 1929.

Bramhall returned to his native county of Cheshire for the 1994 season, where he continued to represent the county in Minor counties cricket till 2001. In total he played 84 Minor Counties Championship matches and 24 MCCA Knockout Trophy matches. He did though play List A cricket upon his return, first representing Cheshire in that format in the 1994 NatWest Trophy against Essex. He represented the county in seven further List A matches, the last coming against Cornwall in the 2001 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy. In total, he played 14 List A matches in his career, scoring 55 runs at an average of 7.85, with a high score of 23. Behind the stumps he took 12 catches and made 5 stumpings. 2013 has seen Bramhall relinquish the gloves to concentrate on perfecting the role of non-playing captain, a role he has started in superbly with Timperley providing opposition players with more sore arses than Michael Barrymore at a pool party. His defining moment of getting Chris Page to bowl uphill and into the wind at Irby will go down as one of the greatest decisions of all time. Bramhall continues to defy the enormity of his current age and will again lead Timperley CC out on to the field for 2014. This time though it will be in Division 1 as Timperley cruised to the Division 2 title last year thanks in part to golden boy Michael Stevens, who's successful pre-match routine of acquainting himself with half the ladies of Manchester will surely look to be emulated in the coming months, especially with the latest hi-tech equipment available in the form of Tinder. Bramhall has done good work so far in the transfer market, replacing Patrick Ashling with the far better looking Mike Rudd and will once again be optimistic for the upcoming season.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Comet Swift–Tuttle (formally designated 109P/Swift–Tuttle) is a periodic comet with a current (osculating) orbital period of 133 years. It fits the classical definition of a Halley-type comet with a period between 20 and 200 years. It was independently discovered by Lewis Swift on July 16, 1862 and by Horace Parnell Tuttle on July 19, 1862. It has a well determined orbit and has a comet nucleus 26 km in diameter. Chinese records indicate that, in 188, the comet reached apparent magnitude 0.1. Observation was also recorded in 69 BC, and it was probably visible to the naked eye in 322 BC. In the discovery year of 1862, the comet was as bright as Polaris. The comet made a return appearance in 1992, when it was rediscovered by Japanese astronomer Tsuruhiko Kiuchi and became visible with binoculars. In 2126 it will be a bright naked-eye comet reaching about apparent magnitude 0.7. After the 1862 observations it was thought that the comet would return between 1979 and 1983, but it didn't show up. However, it had been suggested in 1902 that this was the same comet as that observed by Ignatius Kegler on July 3, 1737, and on this basis Brian Marsden calculated that it would return only in 1992, which in fact it did. It is the parent body of the Perseid meteor shower, perhaps the best known shower and among the most reliable in performance. An unusual aspect of its orbit is that it is captured into a 1:11 orbital resonance with Jupiter; it completes one orbit for every 11 of Jupiter. In principle this would mean that its proper long-term average period would be 130.48 years. However, in actual fact, it entered this resonance only about 1000 years ago, and will probably exit the resonance in several thousand years.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Bagotville is a tugboat built in Quebec in 1964.

Although little information exists on Cantillon's life, it is known that he became a successful banker and merchant at an early age. His success was largely derived from the political and business connections he made through his family and through an early employer, James Brydges. During the late 1710s and early 1720s, Cantillon speculated in, and later helped fund, John Law's Mississippi Company, from which he acquired great wealth. However, his success came at a cost to his debtors, who pursued him with lawsuits, criminal charges, and even murder plots until his death in 1734. Essai remains Cantillon's only surviving contribution to economics. It was written around 1730 and circulated widely in manuscript form, but was not published until 1755. His work was translated into Spanish by Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, probably in the late 1770s, and considered essential reading for political economy. Despite having much influence on the early development of the physiocrat and classical schools of thought, Essai was largely forgotten until its rediscovery by Jevons in the late 19th century. Cantillon was influenced by his experiences as a banker, and especially by the speculative bubble of John Law's Mississippi Company. He was also heavily influenced by prior economists, especially William Petty. Essai is considered the first complete treatise on economics, with numerous contributions to the science. These contributions include: his cause and effect methodology, monetary theories, his conception of the entrepreneur as a risk-bearer, and the development of spatial economics. Cantillon's Essai had significant influence on the early development of political economy, including the works of Adam Smith, Anne Turgot, Jean-Baptiste Say, Frédéric Bastiat and François Quesnay.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"India competed at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Our Bodies, Ourselves is a book about women's health and sexuality produced by the nonprofit organization Our Bodies Ourselves (originally called the Boston Women's Health Book Collective). First published in the late 1960s, it contains information related to many aspects of women's health and sexuality, including: sexual health, sexual orientation, gender identity, birth control, abortion, pregnancy and childbirth, violence and abuse, and the menopause. The most recent edition of the book was published in 2011. The book was revolutionary in that it encouraged women to celebrate their sexuality, including chapters on reproductive rights, lesbian sexuality, and sexual independence. The move towards women’s active engagement with their actual sexual desires was contradicting the popular gendered myth of “women as docile, and passive,” and “men as active and aggressive” in a sexual relationship. The book has been translated and adapted by women's groups around the world and is available in 29 languages. Sales for all the books exceed four million copies. The New York Times has called the seminal book \"America's best-selling book on all aspects of women's health\" and a \"feminist classic\". The organization has also created two single-topic books.

The name 'Fleet' derives from fleot, Old English for an inlet or estuary. Dorset County Council estimate that in 2013 the population of the civil parish was 60. The Great Storm of 24 November 1824 caused waves to breach Chesil Beach, and many of the buildings in the village were destroyed. Seventy-three years later an old man of the village described the events he had witnessed on that day as a boy: \"At six o'-clock on the morning of the 23rd I was standing with other boys by the gate near the cattle pound when I saw, rushing up the valley, the tidal wave, driven by a hurricane and bearing upon its crest a whole haystack and other debris from the fields below. We ran for our lives to Chickerell, and when we returned found that five houses had been swept away and the church was in ruins.\" A new church was built a short distance inland and only the chancel of the old one stands today.

Its widest focal length is 30.5mm and zooms up to 436mm (135 format).  It is the same lens that was on the Fujifilm S100FS.  However, because of the smaller sensor size of the S200EXR (1/1.6\" vs 2/3\"), it's focal length has changed.  Its widest aperture is F2.8 and closes down to F5.3 at its longest focal length.  Unlike other bridge cameras at the time, the S200EXR featured a manual twist zoom lens similar to that of an actual DSLR.  The lens also features Optical Image Stabilization (estimated 2-stop effectiveness). The lens features a fly-by-wire focus ring which is situated closest to the camera's body. It can be used in Manual focus mode with the assist of an focus scale in the viewfinder. The lens can focus as close as 1 cm in Super Macro Mode.

The Portuguese regime was overthrown by a military coup in 1974, and the change in government brought the conflict to an end. The war was a decisive ideological struggle in Lusophone Africa, surrounding nations, and mainland Portugal. The prevalent Portuguese and international historical approach considers the Portuguese Colonial War as was perceived at the time: a single conflict fought in three separate theaters of operations: Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique (sometimes including the 1961 Indian Annexation of Goa). Unlike other European nations during the 1950s and 1960s, the Portuguese Estado Novo regime did not withdraw from its African colonies, or the overseas provinces (províncias ultramarinas) as those territories had been officially called since 1951. During the 1960s, various armed independence movements became active: the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola, National Liberation Front of Angola, National Union for the Total Independence of Angola in Angola, African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde in Portuguese Guinea, and the Mozambique Liberation Front in Mozambique. During the ensuing conflict, atrocities were committed by all forces involved. Throughout the period Portugal faced increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by the international community. By 1973, the war had become increasingly unpopular due to its length and financial costs, the worsening of diplomatic relations with other United Nations members, and the role it had always played as a factor of perpetuation of the entrenched Estado Novo regime and the non-democratic status quo. The end of the war came with the Carnation Revolution military coup of April 1974. The withdrawal resulted in the exodus of hundreds of thousands of Portuguese citizens plus military personnel of European, African and mixed ethnicity from the former Portuguese territories and newly independent African nations. This migration is regarded as one of the largest peaceful migrations in the world's history. The former colonies faced severe problems after independence. Devastating and violent civil wars followed in Angola and Mozambique, which lasted several decades, claimed millions of lives, and resulted in large numbers of displaced refugees. Economic and social recession, authoritarianism, lack of democracy and other elemental civil and political rights, corruption, poverty, inequality, and failed central planning eroded the initial revolutionary zeal. A level of social order and economic development comparable to what had existed under Portuguese rule, including during the period of the Colonial War, became the goal of the independent territories. The former Portuguese territories in Africa became sovereign states, with Agostinho Neto in Angola, Samora Machel in Mozambique, Luís Cabral in Guinea-Bissau, Manuel Pinto da Costa in São Tomé and Príncipe, and Aristides Pereira in Cape Verde as the heads of state.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Otto Johann Zahn (23 August 1872 – 12 October 1965) was the second person to represent District 10 on the Los Angeles City Council, serving from 1925 until 1927.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Rick Roderick (1949&ndash;2002) was an American professor of philosophy, best known for his lectures for The Teaching Company.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Rufrius Crispinus was an equestrian who lived during the later Julio-Claudian dynasty.

In 47, he suppressed a rebellion and was promoted by the Senate to the rank of praetor and was given one and half a million sesterces. In AD 51, the Empress Agrippina the Younger removed him from his command position and replaced him with Sextus Afranius Burrus. She regarded Crispinus as loyal to Messalina's memory. Crispinus married Poppaea Sabina, who would later become Empress (also Nero's second wife) and would bear him a son of the same name. They divorced, and Poppaea married Otho, whom she also divorced, going on to marry the Emperor Nero. Crispinus later became a member of the Roman Senate, due to property qualifications and enjoyed senatorial status. Martial passingly mentions his purple cloak suiting his complexion.

It is important in literary history as the home of Samuel Crisp (1707–1783), a close friend of Fanny Burney, the novelist. At the time of the house's existence, Chessington was a village in Surrey; it now forms part of the urban sprawl of contemporary Greater London. At the time of Samuel Crisp's occupancy, Chessington was a tiny village that stood on a large and nearly desolate common. Crisp retreated to the isolation of Chessington Hall after the failure of his play Virginia in 1754, after selling his house in Hampton, and much of his book and art collection. Crisp shared the house with his friend Christopher Hamilton. Crisp was a close friend of Charles Burney, the musicologist, and came to know his daughter, Fanny Burney. It is likely that Fanny wrote much of her second novel, Cecilia (published in 1782), in the summer house at Chessington, and the pair were frequent and fond correspondents. Crisp died on 24 April 1783 and is buried in the churchyard at Chessington. He is commemorated by a memorial in the church. The original house, said to date to 1520, was demolished in 1832 and replaced by a new building. From about 1850 to 1910 the Hall was occupied by the Chancellor family; their estate papers are housed in the Surrey History Centre in Woking. In the 1930s the village of Chessington was chosen as a centre for council housing. The house and estate were purchased by compulsory purchase order of Kingston Borough Council in 1946, and the Hall demolished in 1965, at a time when historic houses were regarded as of little value. The housing estate built on the estate is a typical example of 1950s architecture. Nothing survives of the rural charm or history of Chessington Hall, except for the monuments and graves of its occupants in Chessington churchyard.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"A drywasher is a common desert mining tool for gold mining. A drywasher is like a highbanker, since it uses a motor and a form of sluice, but it has no need for water. It drywasher operates by the use of air. By forcing air to flow up through the material as it moves down the sluice, the heavier materials, like gold, will stay at the bottom and get trapped by the riffles while the lighter materials will flow up and over the riffles or be blown away. The lighter material that is not blown away will slowly flow down the sluice and fall out the end of the sluice. Drywasher - A mechanical apparatus used for separating free particles of placer gold from dry sediments. Dry placers represent a major portion of all alluvial gold deposits around the globe. Extreme aridity in southern hemispheric regions of the planet causes a slower rate of erosion on placer deposits than if rainfall were plentiful and regional watersheds were hydrologically active. This absence of water directly correlates to the low moisture content of alluvial sediments and the short distance gold moves from its hardrock source. A drywasher works on the principle of gravity separation. Since gold, at 19.1 specific gravity, is much heavier than most other minerals found in local sediments, a facsimile of certain natural conditions (which would involve the use of water, if it were available) can be mechanically reproduced with a simple machine using dry air instead of water as the medium of separation. The process of excavating dry, compacted sediments will often loosen or unconsolidate them. Then, as long as the material is sufficiently dry, these gravels can be processed with a drywasher in a relatively efficient manner. A drywasher was also known, at one time, as a Mexican air jig. To use a drywasher, first, one must determine if the raw material is dry enough to be efficiently processed. Once the machine is set up and stabilized, using a shovel, the dirt, clay, sand, gravel, etc. is loaded onto the uppermost part of the device — the screen, or \"grizzly\". Sediments classified by the grizzly, drop into another part of the apparatus known as \"the hopper\". Once the machine is activated, the finer, gold-bearing material travels down an inclined, vibrating chute, passing over a series of \"riffles\" in a recovery tray. This process varies slightly from machine to machine. Heavier minerals, principally gold and fine-grained black sands (various iron minerals), are separated from the paydirt and reconcentrated by this means. Panning, or some other final separation process, comes afterwards. The first machines were, in all likelihood, operated manually. A simple one can be constructed using a wooden framework, a hopper, a recovery tray, bellows, lever, and cord. Before the advent of modern metal screening material, sorting of gravels into smaller particles might have been done by hand. Such elimination of larger rocks aids in separating gold from dry, auriferous sediments to be processed, consequently, any modern \"puffer-belly\" could be outfitted with a screen, or \"grizzly\" for sorting the dry gravels into two sizes. On Dec 11 1877, a novice miner, William Gibson Guthrie (b.1853 Scotland, presumed d.1878 Arizona) wrote from Prescott, Arizona Territory, back to his brother in England about his proposed venture using the new machine for dry wash mining. This dates the invention of dry wash mining to 1877 or just before. The relevant extract from his letter reads: “'Well, I am going down into Southern Arizona to ? a new process called dry washing. That is working without water. I have great hopes of this speculation, that is if we can get ground that will pay, which I think we can. The machine works to perfection.' It is no use explaining the machine or how much can be made per day – that depends on the ground we get. 'It will cost 600 or 700 dollars between us. I expect to get started in a week or two if everything goes well. I don’t want to say too much about it until we get to the scene of the operation.”' William entered into this venture with a partner, hence the mention of “600 or 700 dollars between us”. Unfortunately this is the last anyone ever heard from William and he simply disappeared from record. He is presumed to have died in Arizona in 1878, aged 24 or 25.SOURCE: Original family letter kept by its recipient and passed to his heirs.

Seamounts are underwater mountains, not necessarily volcanic in origin, which often form subsurface archipelagoes and are found throughout the world's ocean basins, with almost half in the Pacific. There are estimated to be as many as 100,000 seamounts at least one kilometer in height, and more if lower rises are included. However, they have not been explored very much&mdash;in fact, only about half of one percent have been sampled&mdash;and almost every expedition to a seamount discovers new species and new information. There is evidence that seamounts can host concentrations of biologic diversity, each with its own unique local ecosystem; they seem to affect oceanic currents, resulting among other things in local concentration of plankton which in turn attracts species that graze on it, and indeed are probably a significant overall factor in biogeography of the oceans. They also may serve as way stations in the migration of whales and other pelagic species. Despite being poorly studied, they are heavily targeted by commercial fishing, including dredging. In addition they are of interest to potential seabed mining. The overall goal of CenSeam is \"to determine the role of seamounts in the biogeography, biodiversity, productivity, and evolution of marine organisms, and to evaluate the effects of human exploitation on seamounts.\" To this effect, the group organizes and contributes to various research efforts about seamount biodiversity. Specifically, the project aims to act as a standardized scaffold for future studies and samplings, citing inefficiency and incompatibility between individual research efforts in the past. To give a scale of their mission, there are an estimated 100,000 seamounts in the ocean, but only 350 of them have been sampled, and only about 100 sampled thoroughly. Although sampling all 100,000 seamounts is infeasible, major seamounts can be sampled in such a way. CenSeam is a subdivision of the Census of Marine Life program.

Nugent continued to compose songs for a number of years, but none approached the success of \"Rosie O'Grady\". Nugent performed her own songs, introducing many of them to audiences in this manner.

It was named 'Bridewell' after the Bridewell Palace, which during the 16th century had become one of the City of London's most important prisons. Tothill Fields later became the Westminster House of Correction. Like its City counterpart, the Westminster Bridewell was intended as a \"house of correction\" for the compulsory employment of able-bodied but indolent paupers. It was enlarged in 1655, and during the reign of Queen Anne, its regime was extended to cover the incarceration of criminals. In 1834 the original Bridewell was replaced by a larger prison, on a different site, in area, south of Victoria Street and close to Vauxhall Bridge Road. The new prison, designed by Robert Abraham and costing £186,000, was circular in plan (following Jeremy Bentham's 'panopticon') so that warders could supervise prisoners from a central point, and had a capacity of 900 prisoners. After it was completed, the old prison was demolished. At the back of Middlesex Guildhall in Little Sanctuary is the 17th century 'The Stone Gateway', positioned there by the Greater London Council in 1969. This is the only visible remnant of the prison. Originally the Bridewell comprised three separate gaols for untried male prisoners and debtors, male convicts, and women. Inmates were put to work oakum-picking and treading the treadmill, and it operated on a silent/separate system. However, due to poor management, the regime was changed in 1850 and the Bridewell then housed only women and convicted boys under the age of seventeen. The second prison was closed in 1877, when prisoners were transferred to Millbank Prison, and was demolished in 1885. Westminster Cathedral, started in 1895, now stands on the site. The prison's foundations were re-used for the cathedral.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Turtle Rock is a neighborhood in the south part of Irvine, Orange County, California near Concordia University, Irvine and the University of California, Irvine.

Rumour has it on a weekend if you listen carefully you can hear the grunts and shouts of a certain Luke ‘Bocky’ Birks. Often carrying a stolen glass from the Rose and Crown. He will be declaring his love for his future wife Rachel after yet again going out at 11am and not returning until 11pm after ‘popping out to put a quick bet on’. Stanton Hill is a small village in the Ashfield district of Nottinghamshire, England, located three miles west of Mansfield and one mile north-west of Sutton-in-Ashfield. Stanton Hill, Nottinghamshire Skegby Colliery, owned by the Dodsley family, was originally located on Wharf Road, which is now in the area known as Stanton Hill, but in the first half of the 19th century was just part of Skegby. It was situated near a triangular piece of land known as Gore Field. Stanton Hill was first mentioned in the census in 1871, and then only as a street within Skegby. It probably took its name from the Stanton Ironworks Company, which started sinking the Teversal (Butcher Wood) Colliery in 1867, and later the Silverhill Colliery in 1878. Many of the workers for these new collieries moved from other coalmining areas including Shropshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, and Leicestershire. Skegby Colliery was replaced by New Skegby Colliery (later renamed Sutton Colliery) in 1873. It was also known as Brierley Colliery, possibly renamed by the many Staffordshire colliers moving from the Brierley Hill area. This was later taken over by the Blackwell Colliery Company. The huge increase in population of Skegby – from 805 in 1869 to over 3,000 in 1884 – meant that new housing was required in the immediate area. One hundred and thirty-two houses were initially built on Cooperative Street, Institute Street and Cross Row by the Stanton Ironworks Company, beginning in 1877. However, these street names only developed later, because in 1881 they were all recorded as Stanton Hill. By 1881 Stanton Hill was described as a hamlet within the parish of Skegby. Two years after the sinking of Silverhill Colliery the Stanton Ironworks Company acquired more land at Meden Bank, on which were built a further one hundred and twenty cottages and allotments for the workforce. The Blackwell Colliery Company also contributed to the housing in the Stanton Hill area, building the terraces of houses named Longden, Bainbridge, Marshall, Gardiner, Cochrane and Scott's. These streets were named after some of the Directors of the Blackwell Company at the time of construction.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Adenosine diphosphate ribose is an ester molecule formed into chains by the enzyme poly ADP ribose polymerase.

Constructed in 1810, the building has seen numerous uses, ranging from church to school to house. It has been named a historic site. Numerous log schoolhouses were built throughout early Ohio, but few have survived; the Thomas Select School is important partly because of its very existence. Built in 1810, the school was associated with a Welsh immigrant church in the small community of Shandon. In its early years, the Whitewater Congregational Church worshipped in both English and Welsh and supported two ministers; one of them, Thomas Thomas, also taught school in order to earn a living. Using their home as the schoolhouse, Thomas and his wife taught both girls and boys. As the house was a parsonage, it remained in the church's ownership until 1885, when the trustees sold it to a family named Robinson, which owned the building until selling it in 1947. Since that time, it has been used as a summer house. Two stories tall, the school is a log cabin measuring, which makes it larger than most log schoolhouses of the period. Since its early days, the building has been given an asphalt roof and various elements of stone. Among its distinctive components is the presence of \"steeple notches\" in the logs: these are V-shaped cuts made in the logs to enable them to fit together. Notches in log cabins are typically of other shapes, making the steeple notch rare and dateable; most log buildings in the eastern United States with this kind of notch were built before 1800. In 1977, the Thomas Select School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its architecture and because of its place in the area's history.

Sometimes referred to as a foyer, reception or an entrance hall, it often is a large, vast room or complex of rooms (in a theatre, opera, concert hall, showroom, cinema, etc.) adjacent to the auditorium. It is a repose area for spectators and place of venues, especially used before performance and during intermissions but also as a place of celebrations or festivities after performance. Many office buildings, hotels and skyscrapers go to great lengths to decorate their lobbies to create the right impression and convey an image. This is known as a \"power lobby\". Since the mid-1980s, there has been a growing trend to think of lobbies as more than just ways to get from the door to the elevator but instead as social spaces and places of commerce. Some research has even been done to develop scales to measure lobby atmosphere to improve hotel lobby design. Many places that offer public services, such as a doctor's office, use their lobbies as more of a waiting room for the people waiting for a certain service. In these lobbies it is common for there to be comfortable furniture, such as couches and lounge chairs, so that the customer will be able to wait in comfort. Also, there may be television sets, books, and/or magazines to help the customer pass time as they wait to be served. Supertall skyscrapers can often have one or more of what is known as a sky lobby, an intermediate floor where people can change from an express elevator that stops only at the sky lobby to a local elevator which stops at every floor within a segment of the building. Usually a foyer is a large, specially designed hall, but sometimes, it is a corridor surrounding the main hall. It is furnished and big enough to enable spectators to stroll, get together and relax. Foyers are commonly adorned with art works, permanent or temporary exhibitions related to the activity of the institution, and a refreshment room or buffet. Moreover, the foyer can be the main place of some events such as vernissage, meetings with the artists, actors' benefit, etc.A foyer in a house is usually a small entry area or room by the front door. Other public rooms such as the living room, dining room, and family room typically attach to it, along with any main stairway. It was initially intended as an \"airlock\", separating the fireplace-heated rooms from the (colder, in winter) front entrance, where cold air infiltration made for cold drafts and low temperatures. It is commonly used for outer garment and umbrella storage for both residents and guests. The word foyer comes from the French language and means \"the place where the fire is kept\".

The causal organism is a fungus living in soil and wet, decaying wood, often in an area close to a waterway such as a lake, river or stream. Indoor growth may also occur, for example, in accumulated debris in damp sheds or shacks. The fungus is endemic to parts of eastern North America, particularly boreal northern Ontario, southeastern Manitoba, Quebec south of the St. Lawrence River, parts of the U.S. Appalachian mountains and interconnected eastern mountain chains, the west bank of Lake Michigan, the state of Wisconsin, and the entire Mississippi Valley including the valleys of some major tributaries such as the Ohio River. In addition, it occurs rarely in Africa both north and south of the Sahara Desert, as well as in the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent.
