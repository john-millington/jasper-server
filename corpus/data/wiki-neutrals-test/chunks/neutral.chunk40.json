The purpose and function of the part in question depends on the instrument. On instruments equipped with tuning machines, violins and guitars, for example, a key is part of a tuning machine. It is a worm gear with a key shaped end used to turn a cog, which, in turn, is attached to a post which winds the string. The key is used to make pitch adjustments to a string. With other instruments, zithers and drums, for example, a key is essentially a small wrench used to turn a tuning machine or lug. On woodwind instruments such as a flute or saxophone, keys are finger operated levers used to open or close tone holes, thereby shortening or lengthening the resonating tube of the instrument. The keys on the keyboard of a pipe organ also open and close various valves, but the air flow is driven mechanically rather than lung powered, and the flow of air is directed through different pipes tuned for each note. The keys of an accordion direct the air flow from a manually operated bellows across various tuned vibrating reeds. On other keyboard instruments, a key may be a lever which mechanically triggers a hammer to strike a group of strings, as on a piano, or an electric switch which energizes an audio oscillator as on an electronic organ or a synthesizer.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Cyclosarin or GF (cyclohexyl methylphosphonofluoridate) is an extremely toxic substance used as a chemical weapon.

The original agent, tabun, was discovered in Germany in 1936 in the process of work on organophosphorus insecticides. Next came sarin, soman and finally the most toxic, cyclosarin, a product of commercial insecticide laboratories prior to World War II. As a chemical weapon, it is classified as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations. Pursuant to UN Resolution 687 its production and stockpiling was outlawed globally by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) of 1993, although Egypt, Israel, North Korea and South Sudan have not ratified the CWC (thus not outlawing their own stockpiling of chemical weapons).","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Nova (Richard Rider) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

So Clifford Davis presented the tapes to Warners who decided for various reasons that they weren't going to continue with the contract. As implied in Sonja Kristina's comment, Lovechild is essentially an \"official\" bootleg; neither Warner Brothers nor any of the band members gave permission for the demos to be released, and no royalties were paid to any of the band members from its sales. Years after she made the above comments, however, Repertoire Records obtained permission from both Warner Brothers and the musicians to reissue the album, and in 2011 a legit version with new liner notes was released, though unlike the original release it appeared only on CD.The four Curved Air demos were recorded between Air Cut and the band's breakup.

Different versions are effective against some or all of the following types of meningococcus: A, C, W-135, and Y. The vaccines are between 85 and 100% effective for at least two years. They result in a decrease in meningitis and sepsis among populations where they are widely used. They are given either by injection into a muscle or just under the skin. The World Health Organization recommends that countries with a moderate or high rate of disease or with frequent outbreaks should routinely vaccinate. In countries with a low risk of disease, they recommend that high risk groups should be immunized. In the African meningitis belt efforts to immunize all people between the ages of one and thirty with the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine are ongoing. In Canada and the United States the vaccines effective against all four types of meningococcus are recommended routinely for teenagers and others who are at high risk. Saudi Arabia requires vaccination with the quadrivalent vaccine for international travelers to Mecca for Hajj. Safety is generally good. Some people develop pain and redness at the injection site. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. Severe allergic reactions occur in less than one in a million doses. The first meningococcal vaccine became available in the 1970s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.

[Dhanurmas] Festival is also celebrated in the month of Margashirsha, in memory of a story from ancient times. It is believed that Sri Andal, the adopted daughter of Sri Periyalwar, one of the most revered saints in Hinduism, was dedicated to Lord Vishnu to the extent that she decided to marry the Lord Himself. She would offer archana to the Lord in order to achieve her ultimate purpose in life. Sri Andal is regarded to be the form of Goddess Mahalaxmi. During her Dhanurmas Vrat, she composed numerous spiritual versus, which is popularly known as ‘Tiruppavai’. On Poornima (full moon) of Margashish, she finally wedded the Supreme Lord Vishnu, also known as Lord Shrinivasa. At Shree Balaji Temple in Charkop, Mumbai, we celebrate each day of Margashirsha by worshipping Sri Andal and Shree Balaji with one verse every day of ‘Tiruppavai’sung by the bhajan mandali of the temple. Also, on all these days, Pongal Bhog is offered to the Lord and then the prasadam from the bhog is distributed amongst devotees.

Archana Archana is a special pooja carried out by the temple priest. It is usually performed by narrating the name of the devotee, his birth star and family ancestry to call upon direct guidance and blessings of the Lord. The foremost part of the pooja, however, is chanting 16, 108 or 1008 names of the deity and worshipping the Lord with tulsi leaves, flowers and kumkum. Kalyan Mala Kalyan Mala is a holy thread (Andal Mala) offered to Shree Balaji to invoke the blessings of the Lord for a long and happy married life in case of married couples and to seek an ideal life partner and a happy future, if looking to get wedded.

The air is purified, making connection with the Lord, an easier process. Tulabharam (Weighing in a scale) Tulabharam means offering an ingredient required, at Shree Balaji Temple, to prepare Prasadam equivalent to one’s weight. It signifies surrendering oneself completely, with a pure heart, to Lord Venkateshwara. The ingredient offered is used towards Annadanam, Prasadam, and feeding of the poor, which gratifies the devotee and gives him immense peace of mind.

By offering this seva to the Lord, the devotee is relieved of all the sins and sufferings surrounding his life and is blessed with a bright future, good health and great prosperity all round.

While often politically aligned with Europe, Azerbaijan is generally considered to be at least mostly in Southwest Asia geographically with its northern part bisected by the standard Asia-Europe divide, the Greater Caucasus. The United Nations classification of world regions places Azerbaijan in Western Asia; the CIA World Factbook places it mostly in Southwest Asia  and '' Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary places it in both;  NationalGeographic.com, and  Encyclopædia Britannica'' also place Georgia in Asia. Conversely, some sources place Azerbaijan in Europe such as Worldatlas.com. It is bound by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south. The exclave of Nakhchivan is bound by Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, and has an 11 km long border with Turkey in the south west. The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic proclaimed its independence in 1918 and became the first democratic state in the Muslim-oriented world. The country was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1920 as the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. The modern Republic of Azerbaijan proclaimed its independence on 30 August 1991, prior to the official dissolution of the USSR in December 1991. In September 1991, the Armenian majority of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region seceded to form the Republic of Artsakh. The region and seven adjacent districts outside it became de facto independent with the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1994. These regions are internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan pending a solution to the status of the Nagorno-Karabakh, found through negotiations facilitated by the OSCE. Azerbaijan is a unitary semi-presidential republic. The country is a member state of the Council of Europe, the OSCE and the NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) program. It is one of six independent Turkic states, an active member of the Turkic Council and the TÜRKSOY community. Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 158 countries and holds membership in 38 international organizations. It is one of the founding members of GUAM, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. A member of the United Nations since 1992 after its independence, Azerbaijan was elected to membership in the newly established Human Rights Council by the United Nations General Assembly on 9 May 2006. Its term of office began on 19 June 2006. Azerbaijan is also a member state of the Non-Aligned Movement, holds observer status in World Trade Organization, and is a correspondent at the International Telecommunication Union. The Constitution of Azerbaijan does not declare an official religion and all major political forces in the country are secularist. However, the majority of the population are of Muslim background. More than 89 percent of the population is Shia. Most Azerbaijanis, however, do not actively practice any religion, and the country has been seen to be one of the least religious countries in the Muslim world, with 53% stating religion has little to no importance in their lives, according to Pew Research Center and Gallup polls. Alcohol and non-Islamic places are also permitted. Azerbaijan has a high level of human development which ranks on par with most Eastern European countries. It has a high rate of economic development and literacy, as well as a low rate of unemployment. However, the ruling party, the New Azerbaijan Party, has been accused of authoritarianism and human rights abuses.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Lyons Switch is a census-designated place (CDP) in Adair County, Oklahoma, United States.

During that time, the cathedral (eventually demolished in 1669 after deterioration caused by several earthquakes) was an important center of Spanish culture in the Americas, with polyphonic music already in use in the 1540s. The choirbooks were copied and bound in 1602 by Gaspar Fernandes who was the cathedral's choirmaster and organist from 1599 until 1606. Several of the books are still in existence and held in the archives of the current Guatemala City cathedral. One of the choirbooks, previously thought to be lost, was discovered in the Guatemala City cathedral following an earthquake in 1976. In 1996, it was published by University of Chicago Press in a complete modern edition with an accompanying study by the musicologist, Robert J. Snow (1926-1998), under the title A New-World collection of polyphony for Holy Week; Guatemala City Cathedral Archive, Music Ms. 4. Dedicated to Robert Stevenson, the book contains music for Holy Week and Lenten Salve services and includes four settings of the Passion and two unique settings of the Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet. Amongst the composers represented are Francisco Guerrero, Cristóbal de Morales, Hernando Franco and Pedro Bermúdez. In order to encourage the use and spread of this music the University of Chicago Press rescinded their copyright for performance purposes.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Raymond and Scum is a comedy rock band based in Southern California.

It was released on the Sleeping Bag Records label in 1984. The song begins with the recording made of then-US-President Ronald Reagan's \"We begin bombing in five minutes\" joke speech, which is then sampled and looped throughout the remainder of the track. Harrison had considered the joke to be in bad taste; as he later recalled to author Dave Bowman: Everyone has the right to kid around, but that was too public. I hated Reagan's gutting of people's civil rights. I thought everything he stood for was awful. Before the record was released, most people had heard about the joke speech but very few had actually heard the speech itself. It was only spoken by Reagan as a microphone test, which was then inadvertently recorded. Harrison was able to locate a copy of the speech from a college radio station and sampled it. Using what would now be considered to be common hip-hop recording methods &mdash; despite the term only just being used at the time &mdash; Harrison mixed in Reagan's speech with synthesizers and drums, looping the phrases \"I'm pleased\", \"outlaw Russia forever\" and \"five minutes\" multiple times over. The title of the band references the film Bedtime for Bonzo, which starred Reagan, and which also inspired the Ramones' song \"Bonzo Goes to Bitburg\". Despite the character of Bonzo being a chimpanzee in the film, in both songs Bonzo is taken to mean Reagan himself. When the song was completed, no major label could guarantee a release before the 1984 Presidential election so Harrison chose to release it on a micro-label called Sleeping Bag Records.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Simione Tamanisau (born 5 June 1982) is a Fijian international footballer, who plays as a goalkeeper and striker for Suva in the National Football League.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Prijeko Brdo is a village in the municipality of Gračanica, Bosnia and Herzegovina.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Cheam Road is a cricket ground in Sutton, London (formerly Surrey).

This compound is not psychoactive and acts primarily as an anandamide reuptake inhibitor, but is more potent than cannabidiol as an anticonvulsant and has around the same potency as an antiinflammatory. Unexpectedly the “unnatural” enantiomer (+)-CBD-DMH, which has reversed stereochemistry from cannabidiol, was found to be a directly acting cannabinoid receptor agonist with a K i of 17.4nM at CB 1 and 211nM at CB 2, and produces typical cannabinoid effects in animal studies. Another closely analogous compound has also been described, with the double bond in the cyclohexene ring shifted to between the 1,6-positions rather than the 2,3-positions (i.e. analogous to synthetic THC analogues such as parahexyl), the isopropenyl group saturated to isopropyl, and a 1,2-dimethylheptyl side chain.

The technique sees common usage in software exploits, where it is used to direct program execution when a branch instruction target is not known precisely. Other notable applications include defensive programming strategies such as EMC-aware programming. While a NOP slide will function if it consists of a list of canonical NOP instructions, the presence of such code is suspicious and easy to automatically detect. For this reason, practical NOP slides are often composed of non-canonical NOP instructions (such as moving a register to itself or adding zero ), or of instructions that affect program state only inconsequentially, which makes them much more difficult to identify. The entropy of a NOP slide is dependent upon the constraints placed on it. If it can be determined that certain registers are not in use (that is to say, they will be set to a known value before their next use), instructions which manipulate them arbitrarily may be used in the NOP slide. Additionally, if the alignment of both the NOP slide and the instruction pointer are deterministic, multi-byte instructions can be used in a NOP slide without regard to the results of unaligned execution. If the input providing the attack vector into which the NOP slide and payload are to be introduced are filtered (such as accepting only printable characters), the field of possible instructions for inclusion is limited.

The attacker, 52-year-old Briton Khalid Masood, drove a car into pedestrians on the pavement along the south side of Westminster Bridge and Bridge Street, injuring more than 50 people, five of them fatally. He then crashed the car into the perimeter fence of the Palace grounds and ran into New Palace Yard, where he fatally stabbed an unarmed police officer. He was then shot by an armed police officer and died at the scene. Police treated the attack as \"Islamist-related terrorism\". Masood reportedly said in a final text message that he was waging jihad in revenge for Western military action in Muslim countries in the Middle East. Amaq News Agency, which is linked to Islamic State, said the attacker answered the group's calls to target citizens of states that are fighting against it, though the claim was questioned by the UK police and government.

It was the first group of its kind in the United States, developed in an area when European and American avante-garde artists visited in number after World War I. The \"Provincetown Print\", a white-line woodcut print, was attributed to this group. Bror Julius Olsson Nordfeldt developed the technique, based upon Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock printing, but Blanche Lazzell is said to have mastered it. Rather than creating separate woodblocks for each color, one block was made and painted. Small groves between the elements of the design created the white line. Because the artists often used soft colors, they sometimes have the appearance of a watercolor painting. Early artists in the group included Ethel Mars, Ada Gilmore, Mildred McMillen, Maud Hunt Squire, Juliette Nichols and Bror Julius Olsson Nordfeldt. Other artists included William Zorach, Ferol Warthen, Blanche Lazzell, Karl Knaths, and Agnes Weinrich. Edna Boies Hopkins, a friend of Squires and Mars from the Art Academy of Cincinnati, also visited the community. Bill Evaul, a writer for Print Review in the late 1970s, was asked to write an article about \"printmaking in Provincetown\", but by that time many of the artists were no longer alive. Through research with Myron Stout and meeting with some surviving members, like Ferol Warthen, he learned the history about the Provincetown Print and later learned how to create works of art with the technique. Since then, he has promoted the white line woodcut technique in his historical research paper \"Provincetown Printers: Genesis of a Unique Woodcut Tradition\", taught and lectured about the technique, and has created and shown his version of the Provincetown Prints in exhibits.

The enzyme, released into the mouth along with the saliva, catalyzes the first reaction in the digestion of dietary lipid, with diglycerides being the primary reaction product. However, due to the unique characteristics of lingual lipase, including a pH optimum 4.5–5.4 and its ability to catalyze reactions without bile salts, the lipolytic activity continues through to the stomach. Enzyme release is signaled by autonomic nervous system after ingestion, at which time the serous glands under the circumvallate and foliate lingual papillae on the surface of the tongue secrete lingual lipase to the grooves of the circumvallate and foliate papillae. The hydrolysis of the dietary fats is essential for fat absorption by the small intestine, as long chain triacyglycerides cannot be absorbed, and as much as 30% of fat is hydrolyzed within 1 to 20 minutes of ingestion by lingual lipase alone. Lingual lipase, together with gastric lipase, comprise the two acidic lipases.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"In computer graphics, draw distance (render distance or view distance) is the maximum distance of objects in a three-dimensional scene that are drawn by the rendering engine.
