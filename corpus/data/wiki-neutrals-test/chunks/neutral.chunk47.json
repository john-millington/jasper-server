Graham created his \"Nobel sperm bank\" in 1980. Initially, his intent was to obtain sperm only from Nobel laureates, but the scarcity of donors and the low viability of their sperm (because of age) forced Graham to develop a looser set of criteria. These criteria were numerous and exacting: for example, sperm recipients were required to be married and to have extremely high IQ, though the bank later relaxed this policy so it could recruit athletes for donors as well as scholars. By 1983, Graham's sperm bank was reputed to have 19 genius repeat donors, including William Bradford Shockley (recipient of the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics and proponent of eugenics ) and two anonymous Nobel Prize in Science winners. The bank closed in 1999, two years after the death of its founder. A total of 218 children had been born under its auspices. Graham's overriding goals were the genetic betterment of the human population and the nurture of newly conceived geniuses. This was a form of \"positive\" eugenics, meant to increase the number of designated \"fit\" individuals in a population through selective breeding. However, Graham's \"genius sperm bank\" was highly controversial.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"In physics, jounce, also known as snap, is the fourth derivative of the position vector with respect to time, or the rate of change of the jerk with respect to time.

One of his most famous works, it is housed in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, Italy and is considered one of the preeminent examples of Mannerist portraiture. The painting depicts Eleanor of Toledo, the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, sitting with her hand resting on the shoulder of one of her sons. This gesture, as well as the pomegranate motif on her dress, referred to her role as mother. Eleanor wears a heavily brocaded dress with black arabesques. In this pose, she is depicted as the ideal woman of the Renaissance. The painting is the first known state-commissioned portrait to include the ruler's heir. By including the child, Cosimo wished to imply that his rule would bring stability to the duchy. The child has been variously identified as being either Eleanor's son Francesco (born 1541), Giovanni (born 1543) or Garzia (born 1547). If the subject is the latter, the portrait should be dated around 1550–53, but the date is now generally assigned to c. 1545, based on an examination of the evolution of Bronzino's style, which would suggest Giovanni. The portrait has been called \"cold\", reflecting the sober formality of Eleanor's native Spanish Court, without the warmth typically expected of a portrait of mother and child. Such distancing is typical of the Mannerist school's rejection of naturalism. Conversely, Eleanor's gown of elaborate brocaded velvet, with its massed bouclé effects of gold weft loops in the style called riccio sopra riccio (loop over loop), is painstakingly replicated. The painting is perhaps an advertisement for the Florentine silk industry, which had fallen in popularity in the first difficult years of the sixteenth century and was revived in the reign of Cosimo I. The precious golden belt, decorated with jewels and beads with a tassel, may have been made by the goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Henry Arthur Krishnapillai (1827–1900) was a well-known poet in Tamil language.

The leading order term of the expansion is given by the linear noise approximation, in which the master equation is approximated by a Fokker–Planck equation with linear coefficients determined by the transition rates and stoichiometry of the system. Less formally, it is normally straightforward to write down a mathematical description of a system where processes happen randomly (for example, radioactive atoms randomly decay in a physical system, or genes that are expressed stochastically in a cell). However, these mathematical descriptions are often too difficult to solve for the study of the systems statistics (for example, the mean and variance of the number of atoms or proteins as a function of time).

Based on the stage musical Anything Goes by Guy Bolton and P. G. Wodehouse, the stage version contains songs by Cole Porter. The film is about a young man who falls in love with a beautiful woman whom he follows onto a luxury liner, where he discovers she is an English heiress who ran away from home and is now being returned to England. He also discovers that his boss is on the ship. To avoid discovery, he disguises himself as the gangster accomplice of a minister, who is actually a gangster on the run from the law. The film required revisions of Porter's saucy lyrics to pass Production Code censors. Only four of his songs remained: \"Anything Goes\", \"I Get a Kick Out of You\", \"There'll Always Be a Lady Fair\", and \"You're the Top\". \"You're the Top\" contained substantially revised lyrics, and only the first verse (sung by Ethel Merman during the opening credits) was retained from the song \"Anything Goes\". Bing Crosby's influence was used to gut most of Porter's score and obtain four new songs from several new songwriters, Richard A. Whiting, Hoagy Carmichael, Leo Robin, Edward Heyman, and Friedrich Hollander, but other than \"Moonburn\", written by Hoagy Carmichael and Edward Heyman, which temporarily became a hit for Crosby, it is usually agreed  that most of the replacement score was forgettable. Some, including movie musical expert John Springer, have criticized Paramount for substituting new songs by other composers for the originals. (This was a common policy in Hollywood during the 1930s, when film studios owned music publishing houses and hoped that songs written especially for films would guarantee extra profits for the studio.) When Paramount sold the 1936 film to television, they retitled the movie Tops is the Limit because the 1956 film version, also from Paramount, was currently in theaters.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Montévrain is a commune in the Seine-et-Marne department in the Île-de-France region in north-central France.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The following highways are numbered 334:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Well Dressed Explorer (1962) is a Miles Franklin Award-winning novel by Australian author Thea Astley.

Under Mussolini, no policy of abduction of Jews had been implemented in Italy. Following the capitulation of Italy in 1943, Nazi forces invaded and occupied much of the country, and began deportations of Jews to extermination camps. Pius XII protested at diplomatic levels, while several thousand Jews found refuge in Catholic networks, institutions and homes across Italy - including in the Vatican City and Pope Pius' Summer Residence. The Catholic Church and some historians have credited this rescue in large part to the direction of Pope Pius XII, however, Susan Zuccotti researched the matter in detail and discovered that although the pope was aware of The Holocaust, he did not issue a rescue order. Zuccotti states that there is, in fact, \"considerable evidence of papal disapproval of the hiding of Jews and other fugitives in Vatican properties.\" Various historians have given different emphases to accounts of Pius' actions. According to Michael Phayer, \"the question of the pope's silence has become the focus of intense historical debate and analysis\" because the deportations occurred \"under his very windows\". The term \"under his very windows\" was used as the title of a book on the subject by Zuccotti. The phrase is based on an actual quotation from the report of Ernst von Weizsäcker, the German ambassador to the Vatican, who reported to Berlin that the razzia had taken place \"under the Pope's windows\". It also echoes the reported words of the protest made to Weizsäcker by Pius' Secretary of State on the morning of the round up: \"It is sad for the Holy Father, sad beyond imagination, that here in Rome, under the very eyes of the Common Father, that so many people should suffer only because they belong to a specific race.”Phayer and Zuccotti's emphasis on \"papal silence\" can be contrasted with Jewish historian of the Holocaust, Sir Martin Gilbert's, emphasis on \"papal action\" in relation to the roundup. By Gilbert's account, when the Nazis came to Rome in search of Jews, Pius had already \"A few days earlier... personally ordered the Vatican clergy to open the sanctuaries of the Vatican City to all 'non-Aryans' in need of refuge.\" However, there is no written evidence of this supposed papal directive, and claims of its existence only began to be made after the 1963 production of a play critical of Pius' failure to protest the Holocaust.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Hadrotrichodes is a genus of hymenopteran insects of the family Eulophidae.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Lanton is a village in the Scottish Borders area of Scotland, near Jedburgh and Timpendean Tower, off the A698.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Dodë Gjergji (born 16 January 1963) is an Albanian Kosovar prelate of the Roman Catholic Church.

Plastics that act as pollutants are categorized into micro-, meso-, or macro debris, based on size. Plastics are inexpensive and durable, and as a result levels of plastic production by humans are high. However, the chemical structure of most plastics renders them resistant to many natural processes of degradation and as a result they are slow to degrade. Together, these two factors have led to a high prominence of plastic pollution in the environment. Plastic pollution can afflict land, waterways and oceans. Living organisms, particularly marine animals, can be harmed either by mechanical effects, such as entanglement in plastic objects or problems related to ingestion of plastic waste, or through exposure to chemicals within plastics that interfere with their physiology. Humans are also affected by plastic pollution, such as through disruption of various hormonal mechanisms. In the UK alone, more than 5 million tonnes of plastic are consumed each year, of which only an estimated 24% is recycled. The remaining 3.8 million tonnes of waste is disposed of in landfills. This large amount of plastic waste inevitably enters the environment, with studies suggesting that the bodies of 90% of sea birds contain plastic debris. In some areas there have been significant efforts to reduce the prominence of plastic pollution, through reducing plastic consumption and promoting plastic recycling. Since the 1950s, an estimated 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic has been produced, of which an estimated 9% has been recycled and another 12% of plastic waste has been incinerated.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"François Gernelle (born December 20, 1944) is a French engineer, computer scientist and entrepreneur famous for inventing the first micro-computer using a micro-processor, the Micral N.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Joshua Joseph Ravin (born January 21, 1988) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball (MLB).

Males develop it more frequently than females. It has also been reported in goshawks, bustard chicks, and psittacine birds (budgerigars, macaws, and conures). The syndrome is acquired in young birds. Due to a high-calorie diet, especially one high in proteins and/or low in vitamin D, vitamin E, and manganese, one or both carpus (wrist) joints are retarded in their development relative to the rest of the wing; for reasons unknown, if only one wing is affected, it is usually the left one. The result is a wrist which is twisted outwards and unable to perform its usual function. Angel wing symptoms include stripped remiges (flight feathers) in the wrist area, or remiges protruding from wings at odd angles. In extreme cases, the stripped feathers may resemble sickly blue straws protruding from wings. In adult birds, the disease is incurable and usually leads to an early death, as affected birds are rendered effectively or totally flightless. In young birds, wrapping the wing and binding it against the bird's flank, together with feeding the bird a more nutritionally balanced diet, can reverse the damage. The theorized causes of angel wing are genetics, the excessive intake of carbohydrates and proteins, together with insufficient intake of vitamin E, low dietary calcium and manganese deficiency. Angel wing is occasionally observed in waterfowl residing near humans, (including domestic fowl), and the disease can sometimes be observed in areas where geese or ducks are excessively fed bread. Duck seed is an alternative for duck feeders.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Warrior Kings is a real-time strategy video game, developed by Black Cactus and published by Microïds in 2002.

One of her major projects was the design for the lighting at Expo '75 in Okinawa. However, the rise in energy costs due to the energy crisis proved to be a problem. Beginning in the 1980s, she produced the designs for a number of major projects. Three big events for which she was responsible for the lighting were Expo '85 in Tsukuba, the light-up festival of Yokohama, and Japan Flora 2000. She designed lighting for the cities of Osaka, Hakodate, Himeji and Kurashiki, and for the gasshō-zukuri village at Shirakawa. Her 1989 redesign of the lighting for Tokyo Tower brought international attention. She won the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America Prize for the Light Fantasy Electricity Pavilion at the International Garden and Greenery Exposition (Osaka, 1990) and again for the Rainbow Bridge (1994). Other major projects include Osaka and Himeji Castles; the Akashi Straits and the Yokohama Bay Bridges; the Heisei Building at the Tokyo National Museum; the Gifu World Fresh Water Aquarium; the station building of Tokyo Station; Roppongi Hills Mori Tower, and Ebisu Garden Place.

He is best known for the part he played in the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States. He was born near Honiton in Devon. He entered the Navy in 1800, and evidently took part in the abortive British invasions of the Río de la Plata, as in 1807 he was appointed Lieutenant and commander of the schooner, taken as a prize at Montevideo. His promotion to Lieutenant was confirmed in 1808. In 1810, he married Sarah Anne Wemyss from Dundee.. In 1811, he was serving aboard HMS Africa, the flagship of Vice Admiral Sir Herbert Sawyer, the commander in chief of the North American station based at Halifax, Nova Scotia. The following year, he transferred to, the flagship of Sawyer's successor, Vice Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren. He was one of three Lieutenants (the other two being Robert Finnis and Robert Heriot Barclay) detached by Warren to the naval establishment on the Great Lakes, with the acting rank of Commander. The Admiralty however had independently appointed Captain Sir James Lucas Yeo as Commodore to command on the lakes. During the early part of 1813, Pring served as commander of HMS Wolfe, which carried Yeo's broad pendant. Later in 1813, Pring was appointed to the naval establishment on Lake Champlain, based at Ile aux Noix in the Richelieu River. He was temporarily superseded by Commander Thomas Everard (who was senior to Pring) during several destructive raids against American outposts and depots on Lake Champlain during the late summer of 1813. During the early months of 1814, Pring commanded gunboats which played a part in the Battle of Lacolle Mills. In the spring of 1814, the Americans constructed a substantial flotilla on Lake Champlain, which outmatched Pring's force. In response, the British laid down the fifth rate frigate HMS Confiance. This was a ship which required a Post Captain in command, so Pring was superseded by Captain George Downie. Pring took charge of the 16-gun brig Linnet. During the Battle of Plattsburgh, Pring anchored the Linnet across the head of the American line of battle and did great damage, but Downie was killed and the Confiance and two other British armed vessels were forced to surrender. Left isolated and unable to escape, Pring fought on until the Linnet was battered almost to the point of sinking. In his report, Pring paid tribute to the gallantry of Downie, and also to the care paid to the prisoners and wounded by his opponent, Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough. As was customary after any defeat, Pring faced a court martial between 18 and 21 August 1815 aboard HMS Gladiator, but was exonerated and honourably commended. The next year, he was promoted Post Captain. He briefly commanded the naval establishment on Lake Erie, but this was soon closed down. Pring then went on half pay for 20 years, living at Ivedon Penn near Honiton. In 1836, he returned to active service, in command of the frigate HMS Inconstant. From 1841 until 1843, he commanded the second rate ship of the line HMS Thunderer. In 1845, he commanded the 76-gun ship of the line, HMS Imaum, and was appointed Commodore on the Jamaica Division of North America and West Indies Station. He died late in 1846 at Port Royal, Jamaica, possibly of yellow fever. He and his wife apparently left no children.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Rural TV was a rural lifestyle and culture television channel.

Ballis was born on August 12, 1925, and was raised in Faribault, Minnesota. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps during World War II and served in the South Pacific as a mechanic repairing torpedo bombers. After completing his military service, he earned an undergraduate degree from the University of Minnesota. One of his first jobs was at U.S. Rubber, where a manager told him that he \"had to have a U.S. Rubber attitude... ready to go anywhere at anytime\" but found that he \"didn't have the U.S. Rubber attitude.\" After his car broke down while he was on vacation in San Francisco, Ballis decided to live there and took a job writing headlines for article in The Wall Street Journal, where he was called in by his boss about his use of creative phrasing. While working as an editor of a labor newspaper in the 1950s, Ballis took a photography course taught by Dorothea Lange, a photographer and photojournalist who had documented the Great Depression in her photos. He started taking pictures on his own, photographing migrant workers and showing the substandard housing and working conditions that they endured, saying \"I wanted my photographs to reflect to them the power and dignity they had\". Ballis made an effort to familiarize himself with his subjects before taking their pictures, a process by which he was able to take pictures having gained the respect of this he was photographing. Thousands of Ballis's photos captured the efforts of Cesar Chavez to organize Latino workers, leading to the formation of the United Farm Workers. Works by Ballis depicting protests and marches appeared in such publications as Life, Newsweek, Time, The New York Times and The Washington Post. Labor historian Richard Steven Street called Ballis's work \"activist photography with a point of view\" and credited him as being one of a small number of freelance photographers who brought Chávez the public attention he needed to succeed in his efforts. As director of National Land for People, Ballis opposed a June 1980 decision by the United States Supreme Court that ruled that a 1902 law limiting irrigated farms to did not apply in the Imperial Valley. Ballis called the decision \"Morally, legally, socially, politically and economically, a bankrupt decision\", saying that there were a disproportionate number of large corporate and foreign-owned farms that benefited from federal subsidies for irrigation, and Ballis expressed concern that the ruling could lead to the repeal of such limits in other agricultural areas of California. While directing the National Land for People, Ballis made a 23-minute film titled The Richest Land that juxtaposed small farmers and corporate farmers, and Jessie Lopez De La Cruz and Delores Huerta both made cameos. A resident of Tollhouse, California, Ballis died at age 85 on September 24, 2010, at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Fresno, California, where he had been treated for prostate cancer.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Andrea Sussi (born 23 October 1973 in Florence) is an Italian professional football coach and former footballer who played as a left back.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Santurdejo is a village in the province and autonomous community of La Rioja, Spain.

Schools for the deaf have remained largely untransformed, however, and different schools for deaf children in South African still use different sign language systems, and at a number of schools for the deaf the use of any sign language is either discouraged or simply not taught. There are as many as twelve distinctly different dialects of sign language in South Africa. In addition to South African sign languages, American Sign Language (ASL) is also spoken by some Deaf people in South Africa.

It was never carried out. Lack of resources prevented it being mounted as originally planned, and other events later made it unnecessary.The idea was first put forward by Winston Churchill at the Quebec Conference on August 20, 1943 for an operation in May and June 1944. He was dissatisfied by the existing scope of Allied plans for the South East Asian Theatre for 1943 and 1944. In his vision, by seizing northern Sumatra, ''\"we should be striking and seizing a point of our own against which the Japanese would have to beat themselves if they wished to avoid the severe drain which would be imposed on their shipping by our air action from Sumatra\"''. At this point, no detailed staff study of the operation had been made and the Combined Chiefs of Staff were opposed; the British Chiefs of Staff said a whole front could not be supplied from the air, though an attack on northern Sumatra or Malaya leading to the capture of Singapore might be carried out in spring 1945. The matter was allowed to lapse. It was revived in February, 1944 when a delegation from Admiral Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of the South East Asia Command, reported to the Defence Committee in London. Mountbatten proposed amphibious operations in cooperation with the American South West Pacific Area. \"Culverin\" would be a necessary first part of this plan. But Mountbatten and the British Chiefs of Staff saw three objections to \"Culverin\" (or \"Vanguard\"; a plan to capture Rangoon from the sea); \"Culverin\" might not have the effect Churchill hoped as the Japanese in Burma could not be bypassed and would still be a threat; the C.I.G.S. said that only \"Vanguard\" could kill \"Champion\" (a plan to advance into central Burma from the north). And \"Vanguard\" was a complement to preliminary operations further north. Also a decision had to be made by 1st September. The American Joint Chiefs of Staff did not favour \"Culverin\". In part this was because Mountbatten's Deputy Supreme Commander, the American General Joseph Stilwell, had sent a separate mission to Washington to represent his own differing views to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In the event, most of the Imperial Japanese Navy's battleships and cruisers were transferred to Singapore at about the same time. As amphibious operations depended on local naval superiority, \"Culverin\" had to be abandoned. The Royal Navy could not reinforce their fleet in the Indian Ocean with sufficient strength to face the Japanese main battle fleet, and the United States Navy was committed to operations in the Central Pacific and South West Pacific, and unwilling to divert their fleets from the Pacific. The South East Asia Command was far more cautious in its estimates for resources required for successful amphibious operations than Churchill. For the much less ambitious Operation Buccaneer, the proposed capture of the Andaman Islands, they proposed a land force of 50,000 men, where Churchill had assumed that only a single division (14,000 men) would be necessary. Also, since no land-based air support would be available until a very large beachhead had been secured, Mountbatten demanded the use of almost every aircraft carrier possessed by the Royal Navy, which would have had adverse effects on other operations. In the middle of 1945, the matter was finally dropped. The Japanese fleet had been destroyed or immobilised, but the preferred plan was Operation Zipper, a landing on the coast of Malaya. The final major landing in the area was the May 1945 assault on Rangoon, Operation Dracula.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Purcell School for Young Musicians is a specialist music school for children, located in the town of Bushey, south Hertfordshire, England, and is the oldest specialist music school in the UK.

Typical stereoelectronic effects with specific orbital overlaps generally lead to a specific molecular conformation or energy differentiation among various transition states that would lead to a particular reaction selectivity. The stereoelectronic effect, along with the steric effect, inductive effect, mesomeric effect, etc., is one of the key theories in illustrating unusual selectivity, reactivity and stability cases in the course of organic chemistry. Its application has widely spread in organic methodology and organic synthesis. This topic is now entering biochemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry. Stereoelectronic effect generally includes a donor–acceptor interaction. The donor is usually a higher bonding or nonbonding orbital and the acceptor is often a low-lying antibonding orbital as shown in the scheme below. As known from the orbital–orbital interaction requirement, if this stereoelectronic effect is to be favored, the donor–acceptor orbitals must have a low energy gap and they must retain antiperiplanar geometry to allow for perfect interacting direction. Stereoelectronic effect contains a large variety of subtopics, including anomeric effects and hyperconjugation.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Anne-Marie Nielsen (born 11 July 1941) is a retired Danish handball player and coach.

Peres represented Mapai, Rafi, the Alignment, Labor and Kadima in the Knesset, and led Alignment and Labor. Peres first succeeded Yitzhak Rabin as Acting Prime Minister briefly during 1977, before becoming Prime Minister from 1984 to 1986. As Foreign Minister under Prime Minister Rabin, Peres engineered the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, and won the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize together with Rabin and Yasser Arafat for the Oslo Accords peace talks with the Palestinian leadership.

Written in 1941, the piece remained unpublished until 1964, fourteen years after the author's death. Burroughs intended it to be the opening piece in a sequence of stories to be brought together later in book form, as he had done in the instance of the previous Venus volume, Escape on Venus. He began the first follow-up tale, only to abandon the project in the wake of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor; the text of the aborted sequel is now lost. \"The Wizard of Venus\" was first published in the 1964 Burroughs collection Tales of Three Planets together with the unrelated tales \"The Resurrection of Jimber-Jaw\", \"Beyond the Farthest Star\" and \"Tangor Returns\".

Its adherents are also known as traditionalists and traditionists (from \"tradition\" as a translation of the word hadith). In jurisprudence Ahl al-Hadith opposed contemporary jurists who based their legal reasoning on informed opinion (''ra'y'') or living local practice, referred to as Ahl ar-Ra'y. In matters of faith, they were pitted against the Mu'tazilites and other theological currents, condemning many points of their doctrines as well as the rationalistic methods they used in defending them. The most prominent leader of the movement was Ahmad ibn Hanbal. Subsequently, all Sunni legal schools gradually came to accept the reliance on the Quran and hadith advocated by the Ahl al-Hadith movement, while al-Ash'ari (874-936) used rationalistic argumentation favored by Mu'tazilites to defend most tenets of the Ahl al-Hadith doctrine. In the following centuries the term ahl al-hadith came to refer to the scholars, mostly of the Hanbali madhhab, who rejected rationalistic theology (kalam) and held on to the early Sunni creed. This theological school, which is also known as traditionalist theology, has been championed in recent times by the Salafi movement. The term ahl al-hadith is sometimes used in a more general sense to denote a particularly enthusiastic commitment to hadith and to the views and way of life of the Salaf (exemplary early Muslims).","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Feast at Solhaug (or in the original Norwegian Gildet paa Solhoug) is the first publicly successful drama by Henrik Ibsen.

To this place and the kindness of these people, I owe everything. Here I have lived a quarter of a century, and have passed from a young to an old man. Here my children have been born, and one is buried. I now leave, not knowing when, or whether ever, I may return, with a task before me greater than that which rested upon Washington.

The Bicentennial Series was a lengthy series of American commemorative postage stamps. It began with the issuance of a stamp showing the logo for the Bicentennial celebrations on July 4, 1971, and concluded on September 2, 1983 with a stamp for the Treaty of Paris. While many of the stamps showed the Bicentennial logo as a design element or contained the words \"US BICENTENNIAL\" or \"BICENTENNIAL ERA\", not all did. After the initial issue, few other stamps were issued through 1974. An annual issue of four stamps took place (usually on July 4 of each year): in 1972, honoring Colonial craftsmen; in 1973, Colonial communications; in 1974, the First Continental Congress. In addition, a block of four stamps was issued in 1973 for the bicentennial of the Boston Tea Party. In 1975, with the bicentennial of the start of the Revolutionary War, the series swung into high gear. Four stamps were issued honoring relatively obscure \"Contributors to the Cause\", of which the best known was Haym Salomon. On July 4, a block of four stamps was issued showing Revolutionary War uniforms, and with the bicentennial of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the first of a standardized set began—showing a detail from a painting depicting the event commemorated, with the name of the event and year, and US BICENTENNIAL XX Cents (between 10 and 20). This \"painting\" format continued with an issue for the Battle of Bunker Hill in June. On January 1, 1976, a set of three stamps (lacking any text related to the Bicentennial other than the words SPIRIT OF 76) was issued, showing the well-known painting. On February 23, a pane of 50 stamps with the State Flags was issued, each stamp containing the Bicentennial logo and the words \"BICENTENNIAL ERA 1776-1976\". Four souvenir sheets were issued for the INTERPHIL international stamp exhibition in May, showing famous paintings depicting Revolutionary War events. It was followed with a Bicentennial stamp honoring Benjamin Franklin. Originally, the United States Postal Service had planned to issue another 50-stamp pane, showing the entire Declaration of Independence. Plans were shelved after the American Philatelic Society threatened the USPS with a \"black blot\" for excessive stamp issuance. Instead, a strip of four stamps showing part of the John Trumbull painting showing the presentation of the Declaration (often believed to show its signing) was issued on July 4 (parts of Trumbull paintings were used for the issues for Bunker Hill and Saratoga, as well). A painting-format stamp was issued January 3, 1977 for Washington's successful battle at Princeton. Similarly painting stamps were issued to commemorate the Battle of Oriskany and the Battle of Saratoga. Four stamps were issued on July 4 to honor craftsmen with the legend \"Skilled Hands for Independence\". Additional stamps honored the Articles of Confederation and the arrival of Lafayette. One of the Christmas stamps that year, though not formally part of the series, showed Washington kneeling at Valley Forge. By 1978, not only was the nation losing interest in the Bicentennial, but most of the events familiar to citizens from school history books had already had their bicentennials pass. Only a single stamp, noting the French Alliance, was issued that year. One Bicentennial stamp was issued in 1979, depicting John Paul Jones. The next stamp issue would not occur until 1981, when two stamps marked the Battle of Yorktown. The final stamp in the series, noting the Treaty of Paris in the painting format, was issued in 1983. A number of items of postal stationery were issued. Notably, the USPS found issuance of postal stationery a convenient way of marking the bicentennial of some of the more obscure, but important battles of the war (such as 1781's Battle of Cowpens) without the need to issue a stamp.

Advocates of layered telecommunication policies argue that current US regulations are not longer appropriate for new information technologies as functionally similar services (such as DSL and cable modems) are not governed by a common set of rules but instead subject to separate regulatory systems written for each distinct media type such as the telephone or cable television systems. The layered policy model proposes a regulatory system that classifies technologies based on their common layered characteristics instead of regulating each communication technology with a disparate set of rules. Horizontal policy advocates argue that this modular approach to regulation promotes competition by forcing all telecommunication services to adhere to a uniform set of characteristic-based rules, thereby enhancing the competitive characteristics of an open marketplace. Layered policy advocates argue that horizontal policies will provide regulatory clarity for current technologies and they will also be adaptable to future technologies. Layered policies could also provide an equal framework for local governments to provide municipal broadband services in a fair and competitive manner alongside private telecommunication providers.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The 'Capitan O'Brien' class were three submarines built for the Chilean Navy in the late 1920s.

The first Merchant Prince was published in 1994;  in 1995; and Merchant Prince II in 2001. All three were developed by Holistic Design (HDI) but had separate publishers. The first two use MS-DOS; the third Windows. All three support up to four players and differ chiefly in their graphics and user interface. In general, the games are trade simulators where items are bought low, transported, and sold high. They achieved notability, however, for their representation of Venetian and papal politics, with players able to bribe senators and cardinals for political, military, and religious power. Overt attacks against other players can destroy one's popularity and influence, but the game offers a thieves' den where covert options include arson, rumor-mongering, and assassination. The games are won after a predetermined number of turns (years) by the player with the highest net worth, including the value of bribed senators and cardinals. The game's world map has been praised as \"capturing what exploring is really like\", as the player expands beyond the known and certain world into distant seas and lands which have been filled in only by rumor, legend, and wild speculation.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Greenwood Farm is a historic property and nature reserve located in Ipswich, Massachusetts, which is owned by The Trustees of Reservations.

It was invented by Dr. Walter Freeman in 1948 to replace the unique form of leucotome used up until that point for the transorbital lobotomy procedure. This instrument is, essentially, an ice pick with some gradation marks etched onto the shaft. The operation involved placing the pick behind the eye socket of the patient and breaking through the thin layer of bone found there by applying a hammer to the end of the pick and driving the instrument into the frontal lobes. The pick would then be swung medially and laterally to separate the frontal lobes from the thalamus. In 1948, Freeman embellished the procedure by adding the deep frontal cut, an additional swing of the pick deep into the lobe which placed such an increase of strain on the instrument that it occasionally snapped off while in the patient's head, necessitating surgical retrieval. Thus, Freeman had the orbitoclast specially commissioned as a more durable and reliable replacement. Because actual ice picks were used in initial experimentation and because of continued close resemblance to ice pick shafts, the procedure was dubbed \"ice pick lobotomy\". The Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine of 1949 was awarded to Egas Moniz \"for his discovery of the therapeutic value of leucotomy in certain psychoses.\"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"'''Al Isma'iliyah''' may refer to:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Richard Charles Lintern (born 8 October 1962 in Taunton, Somerset) is an English stage, voice and screen actor.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Balad Air Base is an Iraqi Air Force base located near Balad in the Sunni Triangle north of Baghdad, Iraq.

The matter was first heard in the Mayor's and City of London Court, which court found a special verdict and remitted it to the Court of King's Bench, which then heard the claim on a matter of law.

Women were not admitted until Edward VIII altered the statutes of the order in 1936; those receiving the highest two awards were styled dames and those grades, when conferred on women, are Dame Grand Cross and Dame Commander (DCVO).

It rarely forms sporophytes and spore cases, and primarily reproduces vegetatively by stolons, horizontal stems that root at the nodes, resulting in populations of plants that are sterile or only female. This species forms characteristic rosettes of leaves at the ends of secondary stems, which in turn grow from a wiry, creeping primary stem. The rosette of some 18-22 leaves somewhat resembles a small green rose. The leaf margins are revolute and finely toothed towards the leaf tip, which ends in a short mucronate point. The leaf midrib is prominent. Leaves growing on the primary stem are small and scale-like, while the basal leaves on the secondary stems are also very small. It occurs in short grassland in open woodland, occasionally in forests, heaths, sand dunes and chalk grassland, and on grassy rock ledges and tree trunks. This is a useful medicinal species. Extracts such as ursolic acid, flavonoids and alkaloids have been used in cardiac and other medical research. Mosses show great diversity in morphology and anatomy of their gametophytes and sporophytes. Because of their small sizes it is difficult differentiating between Rhodobryum roseum and its adulterants by traditional methods. In particular Rhodobryum roseum is often confused with Rhodobryum ontariense, and Plagiomnium actum, Plagiomnium maximoviczii and Mnium laevinarve from closely allied taxa.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Ranters were one of a number of nonconformist dissenting groups that emerged around the time of the English Commonwealth (1649–1660). They were largely common people, and there is plenty of evidence that the movement was widespread throughout England, though they were not organised and had no leader. Ranters were regarded as heretical by the established Church and seem to have been regarded by the government as a threat to social order. They denied the authority of churches, of scripture, of the current ministry and of services, instead calling on men to listen to the divine within them. In many ways they resemble the 14th century Brethren of the Free Spirit. Their central idea was pantheistic, that God is essentially in every creature. Many Ranters seem to have rejected a belief in individual immortality and in a personal God. They embraced antinomianism and believed that Christians are freed by grace from the necessity of obeying Mosaic Law, rejecting the very notion of obedience, thus making the government view them as a great threat. The Ranters revived the Brethren of the Free Spirit's amoralism and \"stressed the desire to surpass the human condition and become godlike\". They held \"that a believer is free from all traditional restraints, that sin is a product only of the imagination, and that private ownership of property is wrong\". Their most famous member, Laurence Clarkson or Claxton, joined the Ranters after encountering them in 1649. Under the influence of the Ranters, Claxton published his 1650 tract called A Single Eye in which he espoused the dissenting group's ideals. Ranters were often associated with nudity, which they may have used as a manner of social protest as well as religious expression as a symbol of abandoning earthly goods. Ranters were accused of antinomianism, fanaticism, and sexual immorality, and put in prison until they recanted. Even Gerrard Winstanley, the leader of another English dissenting group called the Diggers, commented on Ranter principles by denoting them as \"a general lack of moral values or restraint in worldly pleasures\". John Bunyan, author of ''Pilgrim's Progress, wrote in his autobiography, Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners'', that he had encountered Ranters prior to his Baptist conversion. They came into contact and even rivalry with the early Quakers, who were often falsely accused of direct association with them. George Fox stated that most of the Ranters were converted to Quakerism at the time of the Restoration. The historian J. C. Davis has suggested that the Ranters were a myth created by conservatives in order to endorse traditional values by comparison with an unimaginably radical other. Richard L. Greaves, in a review of Davis' book, suggests that though a very radical fringe existed, it was probably never as organized as conservatives of the time suggested. In the mid-19th century, the name was often applied to the Primitive Methodists, with reference to their crude and often noisy preaching.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Linganore is a census-designated place (CDP) in Frederick County, in the U.S. state of Maryland.

He was a member of Larne Borough Council from 1997 to 2011. Born in Larne, O'Connor worked as a security guard in the Shorts factory in Belfast and also served in the Ulster Defence Regiment before being elected to Larne Borough Council, representing the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), in 1997. The same year, he stood for the party at the 1997 Westminster election in East Antrim, but received only 4.6% of the votes cast. He had joined the SDLP earlier in 1993 and helped found the party branch in Larne. In 1996 he was an unsuccessful candidate in the Northern Ireland Forum election in East Antrim. O'Connor was elected for East Antrim at the 1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election. In 1999, his car was twice petrol-bombed, while his house and his brother's house were also attacked. He described it as part of a systematic loyalist campaign against Catholics in Larne. In 2000, he accused then Democratic Unionist Party councillor Jack McKee of raising tension in the Catholic Seacourt estate in Larne when McKee blamed republicans for targeting the estate's Protestant population. His home was attacked again in 2001, and in 2002, when he blamed the paramilitary Ulster Defence Association (UDA). O'Connor stood again in the 2001 general election, increasing his share of the vote to 7.3%, but lost his Assembly seat at the 2003 election. In 2004, he fired warning shots when confronted by a group of men. While his mother claimed the group were UDA members, the British government concluded that there was \"no evidence\" of this. He fell back to 5.3 percent of the vote at the 2005 general election. In 2006, he became the first nationalist Mayor of Larne. In 2007, he stood again for East Antrim, and was again unsuccessful. In 2007, O'Connor was criticized for referring to a disabled colleague, DUP councillor Bobby McKee, as \"stumpy\". O'Connor subsequently apologised. In the local council elections in 2011 standing in the Coast Road area of Larne Borough Council he lost his seat to Sinn Féin's Oliver McMullan. Later that year he resigned from the SDLP citing their support for civil partnerships as the reason for his departure. During a 2012 interview O'Connor stated his future intention to vote for the DUP. Despite being at odds with his previous nationalism, O'Connor cites the DUP's policy on issues like abortion and gay rights as closer in line with his traditional Catholic beliefs than the SDLP or Sinn Féin's. In May 2014 he stood unsuccessfully in the 2014 Mid and East Antrim District Council election as an independent. O'Connor said that he did not feel comfortable associating himself with any political party in Northern Ireland and was undeterred about standing as an independent.

Following the defeat of the Byzantine army in the initial stages of the war in 894 Leo VI sought aid from the Magyars who at the time inhabited the steppes to the north-east of Bulgaria. Aided by the Byzantine navy, in 895 the Magyars invaded Dobrudzha and defeated the Bulgarian troops. Simeon I called for truce and deliberately protracted the negotiations with the Byzantines until securing the assistance of the Pechenegs. Cornered between the Bulgarians and the Pechanegs, the Magyars suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the Bulgarian army and had to migrate westwards, settling in Pannonia. With the Magyar threat eliminated, Simeon led his hosts south and routed the Byzantine army in the battle of Boulgarophygon in the summer of 896, which forced Byzantium to agree to the Bulgarian terms. The war ended with a peace treaty which restored the Bulgarian market in Constantinople and confirmed Bulgarian domination in the Balkans. The Byzantine Empire was obliged to pay Bulgaria an annual tribute in exchange for the return of captured Byzantine soldiers and civilians. Under the treaty, the Byzantines also ceded an area between the Black Sea and the Strandzha mountains to Bulgaria.
