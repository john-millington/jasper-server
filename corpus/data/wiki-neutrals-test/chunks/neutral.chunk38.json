It grows mostly in riparian zones, from southern Ontario, west to southeast South Dakota, south to Georgia, northern Florida and southwest to central Texas. Wild trees in the upper Ottawa Valley may be an isolated native population or may have derived from planted trees. Black walnut is an important tree commercially, as the wood is a deep brown color and easily worked. The fruits, walnuts, are cultivated for their distinctive and desirable taste. Often, trees are grown for both lumber and walnuts simultaneously and many cultivars have been developed for improved quality nuts or wood. Black walnut is currently under pressure from the thousand cankers disease that is causing decline of walnuts in some areas. Black walnut is also allelopathic, which means that it releases chemicals from roots and other tissues that harm other organisms and give the tree a competitive advantage; this is often undesirable as it can harm garden plants and grasses.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Mathew John Sadler (born 26 February 1985) is an English professional footballer who plays for League One club Shrewsbury Town.

Soon after her birth the family moved to Hobart, where they lived first at Sandy Bay and then at New Town, where Rae-Ellis attended Ogilvy High School. While at school she played the violin and was a member of the school basketball team. After leaving school she worked as a secretary in various Hobart businesses before joining the administrative staff of the School of Physics at the University of Tasmania. There she met, and in 1952 married, William Frank Ellis (1928–2015). They had two children, Niki Maree Ellis (born 1955) and William Mark Ellis (born 1956). They divorced in 1978. Since 1952, Vivienne Rae-Ellis worked as a newspaper columnist, radio scriptwriter and broadcaster, television program host and public relations officer.

Her last performance as an actress in a play was in 1969 when she played Mrs. Earlynne in Oscar Wilde's ''Lady Windermere's Fan''. Rae-Ellis began writing biographies and novels in the 1960s. In 1967, while promoting a local history exhibition for the Launceston Public Library, she became fascinated by a photograph of the pioneer and philanthropist Louisa Anne Meredith whose biography she decided to write. Louisa Anne Meredith: A Tigress in Exile was published by Blubberhead Press in 1979, by which time Rae-Ellis had also published several other books. She wrote in many genres including biography, children's fiction, romance, historical fiction and non-fiction, and she continued to produce articles and broadcasts for newspapers and journals in the UK and Australia.

It has been nominated for both the Album of The Year, and also Best Traditional Album of The Year at the Blues Foundation's 39th Annual Blues Music Awards.

The Philadelphia Inquirer said, “He’s one of the great characters in blues – a sharp-dressing, smooth talking harmonica-playing hep-cat. He’s also a deceptively subtle writer who can cloak pointed or sobering messages within the band’s good-time vibe.” Estrin was born in San Francisco, California in 1949, and fell in love with blues after his sister presented him with Ray Charles’ The Genius Sings The Blues when he was 12. He began playing harmonica at age 15, and by age 18 was beginning to work professionally. Early in his career he played with Lowell Fulson, Z.Z. Hill, Travis Phillips, and Fillmore Slim. Estrin names Sonny Boy Williamson II, Little Walter Jacobs and Baby Boy Warren as key inspirations. He played with and was mentored by Rodger Collins (whose 45rpm recordings include \"She’s Looking Good\" and \"Foxy Girls\" In Oakland). Estrin moved to Chicago when he was 19 and worked with bluesmen Sam Lay, Johnny Littlejohn, Eddie Taylor and Johnny Young. He met and sat in with Muddy Waters at the Sutherland Hotel in Chicago. He told the Sacramento Bee, “Muddy started shaking his finger in my face and said, ‘You outta sight, boy! You play like a man! I know that sound. That’s my sound.’” Muddy tried to hire Estrin as a sideman but Estrin did not receive the phone call, and moved back to the Bay Area. He met guitarist Charlie Baty in 1973 and they created Little Charlie & The Nightcats based in Sacramento, CA. Estrin fronted Little Charlie & The Nightcats for 30 years and performed around the world. They were nominated four times for the Blues Music Award for Band Of The Year. In 2008, Baty retired from touring. Guitarist Kid Andersen joined Estrin and previous band members Hansen and Farrell and they formed Rick Estrin & The Nightcats that same year. Norwegian born Alexander Pettersen joined the band in 2017 as the drummer. Since its inception, the band has played around the world, including the Notodden Blues Festivil in Norway, the Lucerne Blues Festival in Switzerland, the Caxias de Soul Festival in Brazil, the Monaghan Blues Festival in Ireland, the Efes Pilsen Festival in Turkey, and the Moulon Blues Festival in the Netherlands.

For example, if a household earns one extra dollar, and the marginal propensity to save is 0.35, then of that dollar, the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents. Likewise, it is the fractional decrease in saving that results from a decrease in income. The MPS plays a central role in Keynesian economics as it quantifies the saving-income relation, which is the flip side of the consumption-income relation, and according to Keynes it reflects the fundamental psychological law. The marginal propensity to save is also a key variable in determining the value of the multiplier.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yun Kōga.

At a basic level, this is a core aspect of training for all UK military personnel on an annual basis. Regular Army personnel are tested as part of their Military Annual Training Tests (MATTs) as befits their frontline nature (similar processes are run by the Royal Marines and RAF Regiment) with non-frontline personnel mandated to watch a DVD detailing SERE methods. UK armed forces personnel who train at the SERE school, may be subject to methods of interrogation that are prohibited under international law. This training is carried out under strictly controlled conditions and is only delivered to enable the trainees to understand the methods that may be used against them if they are captured by hostile forces who are not signatories to, or adherents of, the Geneva Convention or of international law. SERE is mandated for all aircrew (from across all three services) and involves sea drills for those that require it. Sea drill involves jumping into the sea and spending some time adrift before hauling oneself into a dinghy from where the servicemember can be rescued. The Royal Navy and Royal Air Force aircrews practice this with regularity. Television personality Carol Vorderman undertook sea drills SERE training at RAF St Mawgan as part of her effort to become the ninth female to fly solo around the world. SERE training is also delivered to aircrew because the nature of their job makes them vulnerable to capture if they have to bale out over or crash an aircraft into hostile territory. The UK SERE School has been based at RAF St Mawgan since 2008 and was formed when the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force combined their survival schools with the Resistance Training Wing. The Royal Air Force is the lead on aircrew-focused training for military personnel in the United Kingdom and their second training centre (ASTC) is located at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire. The patron of ASTC is Ray Mears, who himself was in a SERE situation whilst filming in 2005 when his helicopter crashed in Wyoming. Mears managed to recover all of his crew to safety after the incident. The Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force have what has been described as a \"rich history of survival training\". Crews were often lost at sea during the Second World War which prompted this training to be initiated.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Marabda () is a community in Georgia, located some 23 km south of the capital Tbilisi, and a few kilometers north of Marneuli.

He appeared in a couple of first-class matches in the 1934 season but made little impression, and did not return until 1937 when he was taken on to the Leicestershire full-time staff, and won praise from ''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack''. In what it termed one of Leicestershire's worst ever seasons, it wrote, \"probably the only satisfactory feature of the bowling was the advance of Flamson, who in his first full season of county cricket, accomplished some splendid performances\". It went on: \"He developed as the season progressed and towards the close often carried the attack on his shoulders. Powerfully built and with a run-up similar to that of George Geary, he put plenty of 'shoulder' into his medium-fast deliveries and had the knack of making the ball keep unexpectedly low.\" Flamson took 60 wickets in 19 matches in 1937 at the high average of 33.78 runs per wicket. Against Nottinghamshire in his second match of the season he took seven first innings wickets for 46 runs and these remained the best figures of his career. He achieved his best match figures in Leicestershire's only victory of the season, the game against Hampshire, when he took six for 61 and three for 51 to finish with nine for 112 in the game. Flamson was still a regular member of the side though he took fewer wickets in 1938 – 53 wickets in the season at the lower average of 27.41 – and he missed a month of the season through injury. His one innings of note as a batsman was in this season: he made an unbeaten 50 in half an hour in the game against Northamptonshire. In 1939, in an unsuccessful team that finished at the bottom of the County Championship, Flamson was himself not successful, taking 36 wickets at the very high average of 38.16. He lost his place in the team at the start of July, though he returned for a single match towards the end of August which proved to be the last match of his first-class cricket career.

This change in albedo acts to reinforce the initial alteration in ice area. Cooling tends to increase ice cover and hence the albedo, reducing the amount of solar energy absorbed and leading to more cooling. Conversely, warming tends to decrease ice cover and hence the albedo, increasing the amount of solar energy absorbed, leading to more warming. The effect has mostly been discussed in terms of the recent trend of declining Arctic sea ice. Internal feedback processes may also potentially occur, as land ice melts and causes eustatic sea level rise, and also potentially induces earthquakes as a result of post-glacial rebound, which further disrupts glaciers, ice shelves, etc.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"International Soca Monarch is an annual dual-contest soca music event, the finals of which are held on every Carnival Friday (aka Fantastic Friday) in Trinidad and Tobago. Contestants in the event may vie for two separate crowns or titles, the International Soca Monarch (aka the Power Soca Monarch) for uptempo songs, and International Groovy Soca Monarch for slower-paced songs. Recently an additional award has been added, called the '''People's Choice''', which involves text message voting by Digicel subscribers. Subscribers can vote multiple times for their favorite artist during the competition and the artist who receives the most votes is given an additional cash prize. The International Soca Monarch competition has become the mecca of soca artists in Trinidad where the event has been hosted since its inception; and the region, as many artists who have competed on its stage have moved on to successful careers. Dubbed the \"Super Bowl of soca music\" it is a highly anticipated and well-attended event that has been graced with such internationally acclaimed recording artists. Soca musicians from around the region and the world are eligible to compete in the preliminary round of the competition and must attain the required number of points to advance into the semi-finals and subsequently the finals which is an action-packed event that is televised and broadcast live to viewers in Trinidad and Tobago, the Caribbean and other regions of the world. The competition began in 1993 as a local competition for soca aca Monarch (aka Trinidad Soca Monarch), the event quickly grew in popularity as it always featured the more popular artists and favored songs for each Carnival season. It was redubbed The International Soca Monarch when for the first time acts from around the world became eligible to compete for a place in the finals and a chance at the envied title of Soca Monarch. At the inception of the competition, all soca artists (whether their song was uptempo or slower) competed for the same prize. In its current format, a distinction has been made between faster-paced soca songs and their slower counterparts which can still become crowd favorites. Therefore, since 2005 artists with these slower-paced songs now have a chance to compete separately from the usually more hyped-up (and consequently more popular) Power soca songs/artists, and vie for a different title, the International Groovy Soca Monarch. Therein is a sign of the evolution of soca music into two subgenres. Prize money for the competition was raised to $1 million in 2009 for the Power Soca Monarch winner although reports by Caribbean Prestige Foundation indicated there would be a reduction in the prize money. Fay Ann Lyons, the 2009 winner reportedly has received the full amount of the promised award (less 5% for administrative costs) when the prizes were distributed on March 20, 2009. Second and third-place winners received cash prizes valued according to their placing. In 2010 the first prize for the Power category will be US $100,000 and the first prize for the Groovy Soca Monarch will be increased to TT $200,000. The first soca artist to win the Soca Monarch title is Superblue. He went on to win the competition a record of seven times. This record is as yet unbeaten, although several artists are closing in on that number.Since the competition has been split into two back-to-back contests, there have been only three performers to simultaneously capture both titles: Shurwayne Winchester was the first in 2006, Fay-Ann Lyons the second in 2009, and Machel Montano in 2012 and 2013. Fay-Ann is also the first female winner of the International Soca Monarch in the Power category and therefore the first female to win both titles simultaneously. Having also won the People's Choice award on that night, she is the first artist to make a clean sweep of all the prizes at the International Soca Monarch. When the local competition first became an international event, all contestants were required to pass the preliminary stages to qualify for the finals. In 2009, this was changed with winners from other countries' soca monarch competitions being automatically \"seeded\" into the final round. Prize money for the International Soca Monarch has grown over the years and was announced as being $1 million TT dollars for the 2009 winner when the competition was launched in 2008. Fay-Ann Lyons-Alvarez, the 2009 winner reportedly received her prize money (subject to a small deduction) at the prize-giving ceremony in March, 2009. T&T Ministry of Community Development, Culture and Gender Affairs have reportedly suggested future prize money be reduced to $750,000 due to the downturn in the global economy. In 2004, the winner received $150,000, which was an increase from the previous year. In 2006, $500,000 and a car constituted the winnings for double-winner Shurwayne Winchester. In 2008, the first prize was also $500,000. Since 2003, all finalists have been guaranteed a cash award for their appearance. Past title sponsors of the event such as TSTT, bmobile and the NLCB have in the past contributed to the cash awards for winners.In 2011, the prize for the 2011 winner of the International Power Soca Monarch was increased to $2 million TT Dollars, sponsored by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago. This was announced by TT Prime Minister Mrs. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, and in her honor, Mr. Munro dedicated the 2011 finals to Mrs. Persad-Bissesar. The prize for the International Groovy Soca Monarch is now $500,000 TT Dollars. Mrs. Kamla Persad-Bissessar also promised in 2011 that future prizes would be maintained at the current figure of $2 million Trinidad and Tobago dollars.

In December 1787 a Mr. Heath was inaugurated as the first president of the college. The college opened at that time with three instructors (including Heath) and 25 students. By September 1788 Jacob Hall was appointed the third president of the college. Due to the heavy turnover in both teachers and presidents, Francis Asbury's constant work on finding new people to fill these positions was key to the college continuing to operate. Among the professors at the college was Charles Tait, who later was a U.S. senator from Georgia and a federal judge. In December 1788, there was an attempt to burn down the college. However the fire was put out by some of the students before it caused significant damage. In 1794, the college was granted a charter by the state of Maryland. It burned down on 4 December 1795. A large vacant building was then obtained in Baltimore which became the new home of the college. On 4 December 1796, the new college building burned down, and Cokesbury College ceased to exist. The church that served as the chapel to the college did however survive. Cokesbury United Methodist Church (as it is now known by) was first called the Abingdon Methodist Chapel.

It is a -story, five-bay plan house, two rooms deep, with a center through hall. There is an attached -story stone kitchen, probably built before the main house. There are three chimneys—two rising from the gable ends of the main block, and the third from the gable end of the kitchen. There is a large cooking fireplace in the kitchen, with a removed brick oven. A winder stair on the fireplace wall leads to the loft above. The front of the house is on the downhill side, allowing for a walk-in cellar. A porch extended across the entire front, permitting access to the higher level first floor, but that has long since disappeared. John Roseberry, Sr. was one of the original settlers in Phillipsburg. It is very likely the oldest existing structure in town. Although it is on the State and National Register of Historic Places, the Roseberry Homestead has fallen into considerable disrepair, and has been boarded up for at least 15 years. The exterior remains in relatively good condition, and the interior walls and wide board floors appear to be in safe condition. Ceilings are partially collapsed and lath is showing. There are no remaining windows, and most of the doors and staircase baluster are gone. Several of the eight fireplace mantels appear to be late eighteenth century, but much of the interior woodwork is nineteenth century, and there appears to be none of the original hardware.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Moment of Impact is the debut studio album by American rock group Eye Empire.

Reigns debuted on the WWE main roster in November 2012 (having performed in its developmental system since 2010) as part of stable The Shield, and was well-received by fans and critics. Support began to dwindle upon Reigns's transition to a heroic main event singles act in 2014, due largely to his perceived forced push. This would manifest itself with Reigns tying Hulk Hogan's record of consecutive WrestleMania (WWE's premier annual pay-per-view event) main events by headlining four WrestleManias since WrestleMania 31. He has also won the WWE World Heavyweight Championship three times, all despite mixed crowd reaction. Wrestling journalists have offered both praise and criticism for Reigns, noting both his talent and WWE's apparent attempts to conceal fan hostility towards him. David Shoemaker of Grantland wrote in 2016 that Reigns was the company's \"most despised wrestler\" in over 25 years. Fans have taken issue with Reigns over various reasons: his perceived special treatment, real-life demeanor, wrestling moveset, speaking skills and character presentation. After Reigns was suspended for drug use, Yahoo! Sports pondered whether he is \"the biggest failure in professional wrestling history\". In 2016, Reigns was voted the Most Overrated by Wrestling Observer Newsletter readers as well as the Most Hated Wrestler of the Year by Pro Wrestling Illustrated readers, a first for a heroic character since the award was devised in 1972. Into 2018, WWE has continued trying to establish Reigns as a megastar despite audience rejection. Pro Wrestling Torch critics, including editor Wade Keller, have said that company chairman Vince McMahon is engaged in a \"war on fans\". Anoaʻi himself has suggested that there is \"possible jealousy\" from fans over his \"major success\", mocked those who question if he deserves his fictional role, discounted critiques from anyone who \"weren't wrestlers\" and declared that he will not change to appease his critics.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"A horse show is an event taking place over days or weeks, comprising competitions and displays in equestrian sports.

As a member of the Rosicrucian Fraternity, he was opposed to Harvey Spencer Lewis' AMORC and FUDOSI. He was enthroned as Patriarch of the Eglise Gnostique Universelle after Jean Bricaud, and succeeded by one of his students, René Chambellant, who maintained the compendium of esoteric societies in cooperation with the Gnostic church. At an early age, his prodigious memory and learning genius made their debut and the priest decided to teach him Latin. At the age of twelve, he entered the College of Montciel, near Lons-le-Saunier (Jura). He studied Literature, Ancient History, the Classics and Philosophy. He moved on to higher branches of learning, receiving a bachelor's degree at the Faculty of Letters at Lyon where he also received his Licentiate's Degree and a Fellowship. He studied philosophy under the celebrated Professor Arthur Hennequin. He knew Socrates' Precepts of Self-knowledge, but the one that guided his life was: \"Renounce thyself while serving others\". His philosophy professor was such an ideal for him that after Hennequin's death, he left the University. He went to work at the Société Générale, a bank in Lyon and worked there until 1913. Later he went to work for the Banque Nationale de Crédit in Lyon and continued his work there until his death.

It is a long established business, formerly known as Mother Red Cap or ''Mother Damnable's''. The first reference to a tavern in the area occurs in 1690. At that time the locality was entirely rural and the proprietors relied on trade passing by on the road from London to Hampstead and Highgate. The name Halfway House was accordingly also used. It is not clear whether there was one establishment in the first half of the 18th century or two, but by 1751 the Mother Red Cap and the Mother Black Cap (now The Black Cap) were both in business. In the late 18th century the Mother Red Cap was at its present location, and it had acquired a tea garden. Camden Road was later built across the grounds, and the building was reconstructed. The present building dates from 1875 and was designed by H.H. Bridgman. The pub and venue in its present large guise is the work of Andrew Marler, a serial developer of Licensed Premises, who owned it as a 200 capacity pub and in 1988 bought the whole 'island site' on which it stands. He then enlarged the pub to a capacity of 1,000 and built the 500 capacity Underworld venue beneath the pub. Marler went on in 1994 to buy the BBC Television Theatre from the BBC and refurbish and launch the site as The Shepherd's Bush Empire, continuing with the business model of selling drinks to customers whilst being professionally entertained.

Sprague de Camp and Christopher Stasheff, the first volume in their continuation of the Harold Shea series by de Camp and Fletcher Pratt. It was first published in paperback by Baen Books in 1992; an ebook edition followed from the same publisher in May 2013. The book has also been translated into Italian. All but one of the pieces are original to the anthology; the exception, de Camp's \"Sir Harold and the Gnome King\", first appeared in the World Fantasy Convention program book in 1990 and was then published as a separate chapbook in 1991. De Camp and Pratt's original Harold Shea stories are parallel world tales in which universes where magic works coexist with our own, and in which those based on the mythologies, legends, and literary fantasies of our world and can be reached by aligning one's mind to them by a system of symbolic logic. In these stories psychologist Harold Shea and his colleagues Reed Chalmers, Walter Bayard, and Vaclav Polacek (called \"Votsy\", a nickname derived from the Czech pronunciation of Vaclav, approx.: VAHTs-lahff), travel to a number of such worlds. In the course of their travels other characters are added to the main cast, including Belphebe and Florimel, who become the wives of Shea and Chalmers, and Pete Brodsky, a policeman who is accidentally swept up into the chaos. In The Enchanter Reborn the series is opened up into a shared world to which other authors were invited to contribute. In addition to stories by de Camp and Stasheff, who collectively oversaw the project, it includes contributions by Holly Lisle and John Maddox Roberts, both of whom worked from outlines provided by the editors. The initial impulse for the continuation may have been the successful adaptation of the characters into a gamebook adventure (''Prospero's Isle'', by Tom Wham, published by Tor Books in October 1987), to which de Camp had contributed an admiring introduction. This may have encouraged him to wrap up long-unresolved loose ends from the original series, such as the stranding of Walter Bayard in the world of Irish mythology, and to resolve the unaddressed complication introduced by L. Ron Hubbard's \"borrowing\" of Harold Shea for use in his novel The Case of the Friendly Corpse. Both of these goals he accomplished in Sir Harold and the Gnome King\" (1990 chapbook). When the decision was made to continue the series further this story was revised slightly to reconcile it with the other new stories, though the fit is somewhat awkward.Once the loose ends are resolved, most of the action in the second sequence involves Shea and Chalmers' quest across several universes to rescue Florimel, who has been kidnapped by the malevolent enchanter Malambroso. Milieus encountered in the stories of The Enchanter Reborn include the worlds of Irish myth and of Ludovico Ariosto's epic poem the Orlando furioso from the original series, revisited in \"Professor Harold and the Trustees,\" L. Ron Hubbard's setting from The Case of the Friendly Corpse and L. Frank Baum's land of Oz in \"Sir Harold and the Gnome King,\" the world of Taoist legend as portrayed in Wú Chéng'ēn's classic Chinese novel Journey to the West in \"Sir Harold and the Monkey King,\" the romantic fantasies of Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote (with the unique twist of its being ''Quixote's'' version of reality rather than Cervantes') in \"Knight and the Enemy,\" and Virgil's Graeco-Roman epic the Aeneid in \"Arms and the Enchanter.\" The last two stories appear to have been transposed as published; the opening sequence of \"Knight and the Enemy\" refers to Shea and Chalmers has having just come from the world of the Aeneid, which is the setting of the story following it in the collection. The Enchanter Reborn was followed up by a sequel anthology, The Exotic Enchanter (1995), which featured more stories by de Camp and Stasheff, together with additional new authors.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"was a Japanese medical researcher who promoted a variant of the Soviet medical biologist Olga Lepeshinskaya's pseudoscientific cellular theories, known as neo-Haematology, now largely discredited.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"United Irelander is the name of both an Irish political blog as well as the blog's author, who goes by the same name.

The program, which acts similarly to (but is much less extensive than) homestead exemptions in other states, was enacted on August 7, 1997, a product of the annual budget of then-Governor George Pataki. The STAR Program takes two forms: the Basic STAR and the Enhanced STAR. The Basic STAR is open to the primary residence of any New York State resident and exempts $30,000 from the true value of a home or property. The Enhanced STAR, for eligible senior citizens at or above age 65, exempts an annually variable amount ($65,300 for the 2015-2016 school year) from the true value of their primary residence. Essentially, the program is aimed to lower the tax burden on school district residents. This does not affect the overall revenue of a given school district; the difference is made up by the state, essentially making the program another source of state aid. The STAR rebate is subtracted from the \"true value\" of the home in question. The true value of a home is the value determined at the time of the last property assessment (typically done by a town or county assessor), divided by an equalization rate, which is the ratio of assessed value to market value for each taxing jurisdiction, as calculated by the State of New York. Equalization rates are used because assessments are not done each year by town or county officials. In addition, school districts typically do not have the same boundaries as other taxing jurisdictions (cities and towns), so equalization calculations are needed to bring property values to the same levels within all neighboring municipalities, included in a given district. To be eligible for the Enhanced STAR, a primary resident age 65 or older must have an adjusted gross income that does not exceed $60,000. Proof of age is required upon initial application.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Todd Perry and Thomas Shimada were the defending champions but only Perry competed that year with Jordan Kerr.

Led by new applications of hydraulic fracturing technology and horizontal drilling, development of new sources of shale gas has offset declines in production from conventional gas reservoirs, and has led to major increases in reserves of US natural gas. Largely due to shale gas discoveries, estimated reserves of natural gas in the United States in 2008 were 35% higher than in 2006. In 2007, shale gas fields included the #2 (Barnett/Newark East) and #13 (Antrim) sources of natural gas in the United States in terms of gas volumes produced. The number of unconventional natural gas wells in the US rose from 18,485 in 2004 to 25,145 in 2007 and is expected to continue increasing until about 2040. The economic success of shale gas in the United States since 2000 has led to rapid development of shale gas in Canada, and, more recently, has spurred interest in shale gas possibilities in Europe, Asia, and Australia. It has been postulated that there may be a 100-year supply of natural gas in the United States, but only 11 years of gas supply is in the form of proved reserves.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Cryptophlebia is a genus of moths belonging to the subfamily Olethreutinae of the family Tortricidae.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Warren Lapine (born 2 June 1964) is a speculative fiction writer and publisher.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Lady Mary Armine, Airmine or Armyne (née Talbot) (died 6 March 1676), was a learned English gentlewoman and benefactor.

Her business capacity is applauded at length by her biographer, and her personal beauty and activity, which characterised her old age no less remarkably than her youth, were frequently commented on by her contemporaries. She devoted her wealth to many charitable objects. At the time of the \"ejection of the two thousand ministers on the fatal Bartholomew day\" (1662) she gave \"500 l. to Mr. Edm.

They can be used to relate molecular orbital calculations to simple bonding theories, and also to speed up post-Hartree–Fock electronic structure calculations by taking advantage of the local nature of electron correlation. Localized orbitals in systems with periodic boundary conditions are known as Wannier functions. Standard ab initio quantum chemistry methods lead to delocalized orbitals that, in general, extend over an entire molecule and have the symmetry of the molecule. Localized orbitals may then be found as linear combinations of the delocalized orbitals, given by an appropriate unitary transformation. In the water molecule for example, ab initio calculations show bonding character primarily in two molecular orbitals, each with electron density equally distributed among the two O-H bonds. The localized orbital corresponding to one O-H bond is the sum of these two delocalized orbitals, and the localized orbital for the other O-H bond is their difference; as per Valence bond theory. For multiple bonds and lone pairs, different localization procedures give different orbitals. The Boys and Edmiston-Ruedenberg localization methods mix these orbitals to give equivalent bent bonds in ethylene and rabbit ear lone pairs in water, while the Pipek-Mezey method preserves their respective σ and π symmetry.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Samuel Heywood (November 16, 1833 - May 9, 1903) was a prominent early resident of Berkeley, California.
