Griffith-Boscawen was born in Trefalyn, Denbighshire, son of Captain Boscawen Trevor Griffith who assumed the additional surname of Boscawen in 1875. He was educated at Rugby School and Queen's College, Oxford. In 1892 he was elected Member of Parliament for Tonbridge in Kent, a county for which he became JP in 1896. Salisbury, whom he accused of ignoring 90% of MPs, appointed him private secretary to Chancellor of the Exchequer Michael Hicks-Beach in 1895, a job he held before becoming Parliamentary Charity Commissioner in 1900, serving until 1905. Griffith-Boscawen may have been influential in helping to choose Alfred Milner as the new Governor-General for the Cape. The aged Lord Rosmead was retiring, leaving the government, and Chamberlain in particular desperate to find a replacement. The choice of Milner, a brilliant Oxford scholar, was universally acclaimed in parliament as a shrewd option; the candidate was warmly praised for his courage in coming forward during the Jameson Raid crisis. Griffith-Boscawen lost his Tunbridge seat in the 1906 general election. He unsuccessfully contested East Denbighshire at a by-election in August that year, and Dudley, Worcestershire at the first general election held in 1910, before being returned for the latter seat later that year. He also sat as a member of the London County Council from 1910 to 1913; he was knighted in 1911. Griffith-Boscawen had a special interest in working class housing throughout his career. He was a Tariff Reformer who admired Joseph Chamberlain because he became a very influential Conservative even though he was not from an aristocratic background. He carved out a niche for himself as a parliamentary Churchman and strongly opposed moves to disestablish the Church in Wales; following its disestablishment and the end of his parliamentary career, he chaired the Welsh Church Commissioners from 1923 to 1945. Griffith-Boscawen was commissioned into the West Kent Militia, later to become the 3rd Special Reserve Battalion of the Royal West Kent Regiment, with whom he was embodied in Malta during the time of the Second Boer War in 1899-1900, and which he later commanded as Lieutenant-Colonel in 1910. In the First World War he commanded a garrison battalion of the Hampshire Regiment at Saint-Omer in France from 1914 to 1916 and was mentioned in dispatches. He was recalled to become Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Pensions in December 1916, then served as Parliamentary Under Secretary of the Board of Agriculture from 1918 to 1921. He was appointed to the Privy Council in the 1920 New Year Honours, entitling him to the style \"The Right Honourable\". In 1921 he was appointed to the Lloyd George Coalition Government as Minister of Agriculture but under the law at the time he was required to automatically stand for re-election to the House of Commons. Griffith-Boscawen lost the ensuing by-election, in part because of Lord Beaverbrook's Canadian Cattle campaign, but another seat was found for him at a by-election in Taunton and he continued his career in government. Five years later the law on ministerial appointments would be amended to end the requirement for such by-elections. When Lloyd George's government fell in October 1922, Griffith-Boscawen was one of only a few members of the outgoing Cabinet who agreed to serve under the new Prime Minister, Bonar Law, who promoted him to Minister of Health. The following month a general election was held and Griffith-Boscawen once more lost his Taunton seat. He remained in government and set about producing a bill on local government rating which provoked fierce controversy in the country at large. In March 1923 he sought to re-enter the House of Commons in a by-election at Mitcham, but was defeated by the future Labour Cabinet Minister, James Chuter Ede. Griffith-Boscawen was forced to retire from politics as a result. The resulting vacancy in the Cabinet was filled by Neville Chamberlain. Griffith-Boscawen wrote Fourteen Years in Parliament in 1907 and his Memoirs in 1925. In later life he resided at Pangbourne, Berkshire, and died in London in June 1946 aged 80.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The University of Nantes () is a French university, located in the city of Nantes.

In the outcome he became the 69th Minister of Finance for one day only on 30 May 1926, then becoming interim Minister for Foreign Affairs for two days between 30 May and 1 June, after which he again became the 70th Minister for Finance on the same day. He served as the ninth President of the Republic (the first of the Military dictatorship) and Prime Minister for a brief period of time (from 31 May 1926 to 16 June 1926). Mendes Cabeçadas was one of those responsible for the revolt on board the ship Adamastor, during the republican revolution of 1910. However he soon became disappointed with the regime he had helped to create. In 1926 he led the revolution against the First Republic in Lisbon after Gomes da Costa had started it in Braga. Prime Minister António Maria da Silva resigned and just days later (31 May) President Bernardino Machado named him Prime Minister. On the same day the President also resigned and Mendes Cabeçadas assumed the role of President of the Republic. As a revolutionary with moderate tendencies he thought it possible to form a government that wouldn't question the constitutional regime, but with no influence on the Democratic Party. However the other revolutionaries (among them Gomes da Costa and Óscar Carmona) judged him as incapable and in a meeting in Sacavém on 17 June 1926 Mendes Cabeçadas was forced to renounce the posts of President of the Republic and President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) in favour of Gomes da Costa. He joined the opposition to the regime for a third time, involving himself in several revolutionary attempts and subscribed to many manifestos against the dictatorship, until his death in 1965 during the period known as the Estado Novo (New State), headed by António de Oliveira Salazar. He married in Santa Isabel, Lisbon, in March 1911 Maria das Dores Formosinho Vieira (Silves, Silves, 6 January 1880 – 22 December 1949) and had four daughters.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Soo Bahk Do is a martial art founded and taught by Kwan Jang Nim Hwang Kee, his successor Hwang Hyun Chul, known as H.C.

This meant that the United Kingdom created in 1707 by the Treaty of Union between England and Scotland encompassed all of Great Britain. The Kingdom of Ireland merged with this state in 1801 to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories, the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies. The UK is a developed country and has the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. It has a high-income economy and has a \"very high\" Human Development Index, ranking 16th in the world. It was the first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and is sixth in military expenditure in the world. It has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the European Union (EU) and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973; however, a referendum in 2016 resulted in 51.9% of UK voters favouring leaving the EU, and the country's exit is being negotiated. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Interpol and the World Trade Organization (WTO).","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"John Guilbert Avildsen (December 21, 1935 – June 16, 2017) was an American film director.

It flows northward from Upper Russian Lake in the Kenai Mountains through Lower Russian Lake, draining into the Kenai River at the town of Cooper Landing. The native Denaina people called this river '''Chunuk'tnu'''. Like the Kenai, the Russian River is famous for its fishing, especially for salmon. There are two runs of sockeye salmon each year, in mid-June and mid-July, and a run of silver salmon in August. There is no direct road access to the river. It can be accessed either by hiking in from several Parking lots in the Russian River Campground (1/2 mile beyond Gwin's Lodge at Milepost 52) or by the Russian River ferry that crosses the Kenai and takes fishermen to the mouth of the Russian. There is a parking and ferry fee. The first parking lot in the Russian River Campground (past the toll booth, lot on the left) is the 2.3 mile walk to the Russian River Falls.

By the beginning of the 21st Century, Sri Lanka had approximately 9,000 registered medicinal drugs, hundreds of which were non-essential, unnecessary, highly expensive or even dangerous. In 1996 the Government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga had established a new health policy, one stated aim of which was to develop and implement a National Drug Policy for the rational use and distribution of drugs. While this policy continues to this day, no concrete measures had been adopted for its implementation. In 2005 the United People's Freedom Alliance Government promised to establish a National Medicinal Drugs Policy (NMPD) that would enable Sri Lankans significantly to cut down on drug expenses and get quality drugs at affordable prices while saving billions of Rupees in foreign exchange for the country. It anticipated that the implementation of the NMDP could reduce the number of drugs imported, prescribed and sold in Sri Lanka to about 350 varieties. Consultations were held with all stakeholders, presided over by Prof. Krisantha Weerasuriya, the World Health Organisation (WHO) Regional Advisor, Essential Medicines over four days in June 2005, and the draft for the NMDP was prepared. In October, the Minister of Health obtained cabinet approval for the draft NMDP and promised that the appropriate legislation would be introduced in parliament. In February 2006 the Health Ministry called another meeting of all stakeholders and the Minister gave assurances that the NMDP would be implemented within weeks. An eighteen-member National Standing Committee (NSC), including a representative of the People’s Movement for the Rights of Patients, was appointed in March to oversee and expedite the implementation of the Drug Policy based on the Seneka Bibile principles of rational drug use. The NSC was advised by the Legal Draftsman that new legislation should be drafted for the establishment of the NMDA. During 2007, popular pressure for the implementation of the NMPD grew. In October, the Cabinet approved to a Memorandum submitted by Healthcare and Nutrition Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva on the establishment of the National Medicinal Drug Authority (NMDA) and granted its approval to draft a new Act with the assistance of the Legal Draftsman to expedite the implementation of the NMPD by repealing or amending the existing Cosmetics Devices and Drugs Act where necessary.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"In music theory, pitch-class space is the circular space representing all the notes (pitch classes) in a musical octave.

For example, C4, C5, and C6, though different pitches, are represented by the same point in pitch class space. Since pitch-class space is a circle, we return to our starting point by taking a series of steps in the same direction: beginning with C, we can move \"upward\" in pitch-class space, through the pitch classes C♯, D, D♯, E, F, F♯, G, G♯, A, A♯, and B, returning finally to C.

It can also mean later paint added by restorers, or an artist or dealer wishing to \"improve\" or update an old image—a very common practice in the past. The underpainting gives a context in which the paint-strokes of the overpainting become more resonant and powerful. When properly done, overpainting does not need to completely obscure the underpainting. It is precisely the interaction of the two that gives the most interesting effects. Overpainting was used extensively in many schools of art. Some of the most spectacular results can be seen in the work of Jan van Eyck. It can be difficult to distinguish overpainting from underpainting in finished historical artworks in the absence of scientific tests. X-rays are often used to examine paintings because they allow the conservation technician to see what is hidden beneath a surface without having to damage it, depending on the materials used. By using different intensities of X-rays, experts can see different layers of paint and determine whether a canvas was ever painted over.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Ribulose 5-phosphate is one of the end-products of the pentose phosphate pathway.

This book, like the other books that Palin wrote following each of his seven trips for the BBC, consists both of his text and of many photographs to illustrate the trip. All of the pictures in this book were taken by Basil Pao, the stills photographer who was part of the team who did the trip (Basil Pao also produced a book, Inside Sahara, containing many more of his pictures). This trip involved traveling all around and through the Sahara Desert, starting and ending at Gibraltar. The book contains 13 chapters: Gibraltar, Morocco, Algeria, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Niger, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Gibraltar. The reason Algeria is featured three times is that the trip first cut through part of western Algeria, then later up through south, central and eastern Algeria, and finally on the return trip followed the Mediterranean coast of northern Algeria. Some of these countries are huge; for example, Algeria is four times the size of France or three times the size of Texas. The Sahara Desert is roughly the same size as the United States, and the trip covered 10,000 miles (16,000 km.) and took three months.

It was established in 1927 and closed in 1932. Meiklejohn proposed the idea for an alternative college in a 1925 Century magazine article. The magazine's editor-in-chief, Glenn Frank, became the University of Wisconsin's president and invited Meiklejohn to begin the college within the university. Despite pushback from the faculty, the college opened in the fall of 1927 with a self-governing community of 119 students and less than a dozen faculty. Students followed a uniform curriculum: Periclean Athens for freshmen and modern America for sophomores. The program sought to teach democracy and to foster an intrinsic love of learning within its students. The college's students became known as free spirited outsiders within the university for their different dress, apathetic demeanor, and greater interest in reading books. The college's demographics were unlike the rest of the university, with students largely not from Wisconsin and disproportionately of Jewish and East Coast families. The college developed a reputation for radicalism and wanton anarchy, especially within Wisconsin. The students lived and worked with their teachers, called advisers, in Adams Hall, away from the heart of the university. They had no fixed schedule, no compulsory lessons, and no semesterly grades, though they read from a common syllabus. The advisers taught primarily through tutorial instead of lectures. Extracurricular groups, including philosophy, law, and theater clubs, were entirely student-led. The Great Depression and lack of outreach to Wisconsinites and UW faculty led to the college's slow decline. Enrollment decreased every year since the program began, which its statewide reputation exacerbated. After his son was expelled in 1931 by dean and Experimental College critic George Sellery, Meiklejohn recommended the college's dissolution. Public criticism of the college included student radicalism, lack of discipline, administrative issues, and financial issues. Meiklejohn wrote a retrospective of the college, which philosopher John Dewey reviewed favorably and noted for its contribution to educational philosophy. University of Wisconsin faculty and regents voted to dissolve the college in May 1932. Some advisers stayed to teach in the university, and Meiklejohn remained briefly before moving to Berkeley. The Experimental College influenced programs internal to the university, and was the precursor to its Integrated Liberal Studies undergraduate program.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Kevin Daniel Ríos Quintana (born January 24, 1993 in Rionegro, Antioquia) is a Colombian amateur track cyclist.

Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigability. Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity. A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations. Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water, while other structures such as floodgates or levees (also known as dikes) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions. The word dam can be traced back to Middle English, and before that, from Middle Dutch, as seen in the names of many old cities. The first known appearance of dam occurs in 1165. However, there is one village, Obdam, that is already mentioned in 1120. The word seems to be related to the Greek word taphos, meaning \"grave\" or \"grave hill\". So the word should be understood as \"dike from dug out earth\". The names of more than 40 places (with minor changes) from the Middle Dutch era (1150–1500 CE) such as Amsterdam (founded as 'Amstelredam' in the late 12th century) and Rotterdam, also bear testimony to the use of the word in Middle Dutch at that time.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Ipratropium bromide, sold under the trade name Atrovent among others, is a medication which opens up the medium and large airways in the lungs.

It is also found in Mexico and Central America and possibly in the northern part of South America. The species belongs to the family of slug caterpillars, Limacodidae. The caterpillar is primarily green with brown at either end and a prominent white-ringed brown dot in the center which resembles a saddle. It has a pair of fleshy horns at either end. These and most of the rest of the body bear urticating hairs that secrete an irritating venom. Contact with the hairs causes a painful, swollen rash and sometimes nausea in humans. The hairs should be removed from the skin immediately to prevent more venom spread. The cocoon may also have irritating hairs and hairs from the larva can fall on surrounding objects. The larva feeds on a large variety of plants. In Florida and Alabama in the United States, it feeds on ornamental palms such as the Manila palm (Adonidia merrillii). The adult is a dark brown, stout-bodied moth.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"'Everything I've Got in My Pocket' was the debut album by actress Minnie Driver, released in 2004.

Born in Stark, New York, Pierce was the son of Duane and Mary (Morse) Pierce. He attended public and private schools, and taught school before deciding to become a doctor. In 1862, he graduated from Eclectic Medical College in Cincinnati, Ohio. He practiced medicine in Titusville, Pennsylvania from 1862 to 1866, and moved to Buffalo, New York in 1867. Pierce engaged in the manufacture and sale of patent medicines and established the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute. His manufacturing business started with \"Doctor Pierce's Favorite Prescription\", which he followed with other medicines, including Smart Weed and Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets. His venture proved a success, with nearly one million bottles of Dr. Pierce's Smart Weed and other preparations shipped annually. He was a member of the New York State Senate (31st D.) in 1878 and 1879. Pierce was elected as a Republican to the 46th United States Congress, holding office from March 4, 1879 to September 18, 1880, when he resigned.

This song is built around a guitar hook reminiscent of spy film scores and surf music. It has a twelve bar blues progression, using only three chords until the coda. The eleven cries of \"Batman!\" are sung by a chorus of four tenors and four sopranos (performed by The Ron Hicklin Singers). A long held myth purports that the chorus is actually a group of horns.

However, Neal Hefti, the writer of the theme, stated that the chorus was made up of eight singers, one of whom jokingly wrote on his part, \"word and music by Neal Hefti\". ''TV's Biggest Hits'' by Jon Burlingame, published in 1996, focuses exclusively on TV theme songs, and includes an interview with Hefti about the creation of the Batman theme song. According to Burlingame, the song consisted of \"bass guitar, low brass and percussion to create a driving rhythm, while an eight-voice chorus sings 'Batman!' in harmony with the trumpets.\" In addition to Neal Hefti's original version, and the television soundtrack version by Nelson Riddle, versions were covered by The Marketts (single \"Batman Theme\" and album The Batman Theme by The Marketts), The Ventures (The Ventures Play the \"Batman\" Theme, Dolton BST8042, 3/1966), Al Hirt, The Standells and actor/musician David McCallum.

He was an originator of the branch of artificial intelligence based on machine learning, prediction and probability. He circulated the first report on non-semantic machine learning in 1956. Solomonoff first described algorithmic probability in 1960, publishing the theorem that launched Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic information theory. He first described these results at a Conference at Caltech in 1960, and in a report, Feb. 1960, \"A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference.\" He clarified these ideas more fully in his 1964 publications, \"A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference,\" Part I and Part II. Algorithmic probability is a mathematically formalized combination of Occam's razor,   and the Principle of Multiple Explanations. It is a machine independent method of assigning a probability value to each hypothesis (algorithm/program) that explains a given observation, with the simplest hypothesis (the shortest program) having the highest probability and the increasingly complex hypotheses receiving increasingly small probabilities. Solomonoff founded the theory of universal inductive inference, which is based on solid philosophical foundations and has its root in Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic information theory. The theory uses algorithmic probability in a Bayesian framework. The universal prior is taken over the class of all computable measures; no hypothesis will have a zero probability. This enables Bayes' rule (of causation) to be used to predict the most likely next event in a series of events, and how likely it will be. Although he is best known for algorithmic probability and his general theory of inductive inference, he made many other important discoveries throughout his life, most of them directed toward his goal in artificial intelligence: to develop a machine that could solve hard problems using probabilistic methods.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Andrijevica (Montenegrin Cyrillic: Андријевица, ) is a town and the seat of Andrijevica Municipality in eastern Montenegro.

It is a rare disease spread by infected rodents and can be caused by two specific types of bacteria. Most cases occur in Japan, but specific strains of the disease are present in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Africa. Some cases are diagnosed after patients were exposed to the urine or bodily secretions of an infected animal. These secretions can come from the mouth, nose, or eyes of the rodent. The majority of cases are due to the animal's bite. It can also be transmitted through food or water contaminated with rat feces or urine. Other animals can be infected with this disease, including weasels, gerbils, and squirrels. Household pets such as dogs or cats exposed to these animals can also carry the disease and infect humans.

The village has a population of 1,700. Podegrodzie is the seat of one of the oldest Roman Catholic parishes in historic Lesser Poland. It was probably established here in 1014 by Boleslaw Chroby, because in the early Middle Ages, two fortified gord existed in this area: Zamczysko and Grobla. Furthermore, Podegrodzie is one of the centers of an ethnic group Lachy Sadeckie. Here, the Museum of Lachy Sadeckie is located. The village owes its name to the location. Podegrodzie in loose translation means \"a settlement under the gord\", as it was located at the two castellan residencies, the gords of Grobla and Zamczysko. It was first mentioned in documents from the late 13th century, and Jan Długosz wrote its name in two ways: Podgrodzye and Podgrodze. In 1538 it was spelled Podegrodze, and in 1581 – Podgrodzie. In the late 10th century, when southern Lesser Poland became part of the Kingdom of Poland, the seat of the Castellan was a gord at Naszczowice. After it had burned, the castellans moved their residence to the Zamczysko gord, which also burned after some time. Next residence was the gord of Grobla, located on a hill several hundred meters southwards. The village of Podegrodzie was established between the two gords. In 1241, Podegrodzie and Grobla were destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Poland. As a result, the town of Stary Sącz was founded in 1278, replacing Grobla as main administrative center of the region.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Shawnee State Forest, also known as \"Ohio's Little Smokies\", is a state forest in the U.S. state of Ohio.

At present the Bola Batu babirusa is only known for certain from subfossil remains from the southern arm of Sulawesi. Based on a single skull from central Sulawesi it has been suggested that babirusas from this part of Sulawesi represent an extant population of the Bola Batu babirusa, and this was followed in the third edition of Mammal Species of the World. However, the most recent major review also found similarities between the central Sulawesi specimen and the Togian babirusa, leading them to conclude that it represents an undescribed taxon and that the taxonomic position of central Sulawesi babirusas only can be determined through additional specimens. Subfossil remains from the south-western arm of Sulawesi, where now likely extinct, have been classified as Bola Batu babirusas, but these were considered unclassifiable in 2002, as were extant populations from the eastern arm of Sulawesi and Buton due to the lack of specimens.

For quartz and feldspar rich rocks in continental crust this occurs at an approximate depth of 13–18 km (roughly equivalent to temperatures in the range 250-400 °C). At this depth rock becomes less likely to fracture, and more likely to deform ductilely by creep. This happens because the brittle strength of a material is increased by the confining pressure, whilst the ductile strength of a material decreases with increasing temperature. The transition zone occurs at the level in the crust where the downwards increasing brittle strength equals the upwards increasing ductile strength, giving a characteristic \"saw-tooth\" crustal strength profile. This zone is, therefore, the strongest part of the crust and the depth at which many earthquakes occur. The level of the transition zone depends on both strain rate and temperature gradient, being shallower for slow deformation and/or high heat flow and deeper for fast deformation and/or low heat flow. Crustal composition will also affect the depth at which this zone occurs. Sections of fault zones once active in the transition zone, and now exposed at the surface, typically have a complex overprinting of brittle and ductile rock types.

The Germans immediately requisitioned a large area around Skydebanevej, and mid August the same year a seaplane base had been established, however without many of the fixed facilities needed at a fully operational base in wartime. Construction works continued throughout the war building bunkers, field fortifications, barbed wire fences and air defense sites. Spread out over the large area were the many facilities that are part of a wartime air base: Quartering barracks, office buildings, infirmary, workshops and ammunition depots. One air defence battery was set up to protect the base, including three 20 mm AA machine cannon commandeered by the Germans from the Danish army in April 1940 after the first British air raids against one of the other two German air bases in the Aalborg area the night between 20. and 21. of April 1940. The hangar at the seaplane is a standard German Junkershalle. Build winter 1940-41. Thus Seefliegerhorst Aalborg was a well equipped major air base for seaplanes with the task to secure the northern waters around Denmark and southern Norway against allied ships through sea reconnaissance and Anti-submarine warfare. On the 5th of May 1940 two Arado Ar 196A-3 seaplanes from Seefliegerhorst Aalborg managed to force the British minelayer submarine \"Seal\" to surrender in Kattegat. The submarine had successfully completed laying a 50-mine mine barrier west of the Swedish island Vinga, but was subsequently damaged by a German sea mine. The crew managed to surface the damaged submarine. The submarine was initially tugged to Frederikshavn and later to Kiel, where it was used to train German submariners and in the German propaganda. Furthermore, the seaplanes from Aalborg conducted minelaying operations in harbors in northern Britain and raids against convoys at Scotland. Concurrently with these operations the seaplanes were used in sea rescue operations in Danish waters. It all contributed to maintaining connection to the German forces in Norway. In addition to the ordinary crew of 1500 persons at Seefliegerhorst Aalborg several training formations were stationed there for shorter or longer periods during the war. In 1943 a school for training seaplane pilots was established in Aalborg. On the 27th of May 1944 the so-called Bordkommando for the German battleship Tirpitz was established.

Using whalebones, native hardwoods, and objects recovered from the sea, they built large open rooms with magnificent views of the sea. Without wells or electricity, they collected rainwater from the roofs and stored it in cisterns for bathing and washing. The master bath had a large tree that grew right up through a large hole in the roof. Large windows facing the prevailing trade winds had plexiglass panes that could be lowered into place. The bedrooms surrounded a central dining room, veranda and large bar made from a humpback whale's jaw bone. In the early years there was not even a road to Moonhole. People from Paget Farm walked in daily to bring in fresh fruit and freshly baked bread and to do any necessary cooking. Tom and Gladdie later formed Moonhole Company Limited and contributed the approximately 30 acre property to the company. Tom bequeathed his controlling interest in Moonhole Company Limited to a trust for the protection and preservation of Moonhole for posterity. The Thomas and Gladys Johnston Moonhole Conservation Trust Limited is dedicated to preserving the unique architecture, lifestyle, and vision of the Johnstons and to protecting the birds, wildlife and marine life on the peninsula at the western end of Bequia. There are now eleven privately owned homes at Moonhole and four houses owned by Moonhole Company Limited. In 2004 The New York Times described Moonhole: \"It is a quirky 19-home ecologically oriented development built of native stone, with whalebone accents, on the steep hills of the island's southern tip. The name comes from a soaring natural arch on the shore through which the moon can be seen at times. The whalebones, remnants of aboriginal whaling by the islanders, are big enough to work as elements like stair railings. The houses, which rely on solar electricity, rainwater and propane tanks, are mostly fanciful open-air affairs with lines blurred between indoors and out.\"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is a 2009 parody novel by Seth Grahame-Smith.

They played a crucial part in temporarily inflating the market capitalization of energy traders such as Enron, CMS Energy, Reliant Energy, and Dynegy. In international scenarios, round tripping is used for tax evasion and money laundering as well. Other companies making unconventional round-tripping deals include AOL with Sun Microsystems and Global Crossing with Qwest Communications. It is alleged that when some telecommunications companies swapped capacity, they booked the value of the incoming capacity as revenue and the value of the outgoing capacity as an investment. These transactions had the effect of inflating profits. The SEC ruled that booking revenues from swaps in telecommunications capacity was improper. Many such companies have used round-tripping to distort the market by establishing false revenue benchmarks, aiming to meet or beat the numbers put out by Wall Street stock analysts. As a result of abusive round trips, barter between publicly held companies has become discredited among professional investors.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Tulette is a commune in the Drôme department in southeastern France.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The United States Air Force (USAF) deployed combat aircraft to Thailand from 1961 to 1975 during the Vietnam War.

In Little Feller II (July 7), the warhead was suspended only three feet above the ground and had a yield equivalent to only 22 tons of TNT.

This test was performed in conjunction with Operation Ivy Flats, a simulated military environment, and was observed by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and presidential adviser General Maxwell D.

Little Feller I has the additional distinction of being the last near-ground atmospheric nuclear detonation conducted by the United States of America (the high altitude Fishbowl tests concluded in November 1962 with a detonation at around 21 km altitude).

The light signal is compared with standard or reference light from a \"local oscillator\" (LO) that would have a fixed offset in frequency and phase from the signal if the latter carried null information. \"Heterodyne\" signifies more than one frequency, in contrast to the single frequency employed in homodyne detection. The comparison of the two light signals is typically accomplished by combining them in a photodiode detector, which has a response that is linear in energy, and hence quadratic in amplitude of electromagnetic field. Typically, the two light frequencies are similar enough that their difference or beat frequency produced by the detector is in the radio or microwave band that can be conveniently processed by electronic means. This technique became widely applicable to topographical and velocity-sensitive imaging with the invention in the 1990s of synthetic array heterodyne detection. The light reflected from a target scene is focussed on a relatively inexpensive photodetector consisting of a single large physical pixel, while a different LO frequency is also tightly focussed on each virtual pixel of this detector, resulting in an electrical signal from the detector carrying a mixture of beat frequencies that can be electronically isolated and distributed spatially to present an image of the scene. The optical heterodyne technique is also employed in microscopy, with medical applications. The technique can also be applied to the convenient generation of stable microwave signals.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Johann Friedrich Klöffler (20 April 1725 – 21 February 1790) was a German conductor, composer, and administrator.

The Pelister (peak (2601 metres, or 8533 feet) overlooks the city of Bitola. Baba Mountain is the third highest mountain in the Republic of Macedonia. Other peaks besides Pelister are Dva Groba (2514 metres), Veternica (2420 metres), Musa (2350 metres), Rzana (2334 meters), Shiroka (2218 metres), Kozji Kamen (2199 metres), Griva (2198 metres) and Golema Chuka (2188 metres) in the Republic of Macedonia, and Belavoda (2.179 meters), Kirko (2.155 meters) in Greece. The Baba massif splits up the rivers in the region, so that they either flow towards the Adriatic or the Aegean sea. Pelister National Park's flora include the five-needle pine molica (Pinus peuce) - a unique species of tertiary age being present on only a few mountains in the Balkan Peninsula. Fauna in the area include: bears, roe deer, wolves, chamois, deer, wild boars, rabbits, several species of eagles, partridges, redbilled jackdaws, and the endemic Macedonian Pelagonia trout. In a comprehensive article published in 2002, Melovski and Godes reported that there are three large carnivores in the republic of Macedonia which can be found in Baba Mountain and surrounds, the brown bear, the wolf and the lynx. Actual numbers at that time were difficult to estimate given that most reports came from non-scientific sources (surveys, hunters and anecdotal reports), however in 2002, it was estimated there were approximately 30 bears in N.P. Pelister and Galicica N.P hosting only 3-4. A larger number could apparently be found in the N.P Mavrovo. The numbers however may be significantly larger in today's climate given the protected status of bears in Macedonia. In terms of wolves, there was an estimated total of 1200 wolves in the entire country of Macedonia, with an estimated 54 lynx when the article was written. Pelister is the oldest and second largest national park in Republic of Macedonia after Mavrovo. It is one of the leading tourist areas in the country, since it is a well-known ski resort, along with Ohrid, Prespa, Dojran, Popova Šapka, and Kruševo. Pelister provides views of the Pelagonia valley, Lake Prespa, Nidže, Galičica, Jakupica, and the city of Bitola. Pelister is also one of the most southern mountains in the Balkans that has an alpine character. Pelister is also known for its two mountain lakes, which are called Pelister's Eyes. The Big lake is 2,218 metres above the sea level while the Small lake is 2,180 metres high. Here are the sources of many rivers. The climate in Pelister National Park is diverse. On the peaks, there is snow even in July, and in some places the new snow meets the old from previous years.

The season continues the story of the Wisteria Lane residents, while their seemingly perfect lives in the suburban neighborhood are shaken by the arrival of the mysterious Betty Applewhite. Broadcast in the Sunday night time slot at 9.00 ET, the season aired twenty-four regular episodes, including a two-part season finale. In addition, three clip shows were produced for the season, in order to put the previous events of the show in perspective. \"All the Juicy Details\" aired before the eleventh episode, detailing the most memorable events of the season's first half, whereas \"The More You Know, The Juicier It Gets\", which aired before the twentieth episode, prepared the viewers for the highly anticipated season finale. \"Time to Come Clean\" aired three weeks before the inception of the third season, and reviewed the previous mysteries of the series before introducing the new story lines. The second season had fourteen roles receiving star billing, out of whom eleven were part of the first season's main cast. The main story lines of the season were Susan Mayer's relationship with her former husband, Gabrielle Solis' upcoming motherhood, Lynette Scavo's return to work and the death of Bree Van de Kamp's husband. The season received mainly negative reviews from television critics, noting Marc Cherry's lack of involvement in the production as one of the main reasons for the series' decreasing quality. Cherry has since said that he regrets most of the second season and that ABC's decision to order an additional episode for the season forced the series to work on an abbreviated schedule. However, the main cast members, as well as the guest stars, received critical acclaim, resulting in numerous awards and nominations. The highest rated episode of the season was the season premiere, watched by 28.36 million viewers, with a 10.1 rating, being the series' second highest rated episode to date.

Severus was the son of the Roman senator and philosopher Gnaeus Claudius Severus Arabianus by an unnamed mother. Severus was of Pontian Greek descent. He was born and raised in Pompeiopolis, a city in the Roman province of Galatia. His paternal grandfather Gaius Claudius Severus was a consul and the first Roman governor of Arabia Petraea in the reign of the Emperor Trajan, 98-117. Like his father, Severus was a follower of peripatetic philosophy. Although Severus held no major political influence, he was considered as an influential figure in the intellectual and philosopher circles in Rome. Like his father, Severus was a friend and had a great influence on the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180). It was probably Severus that introduced Marcus Aurelius, to the rhetorician Cornelianus and by his personal physician recommendation, introduced Marcus Aurelius to the Greek physician Galen. Severus with his father accompanied Marcus Aurelius on a philosophical visit to Athens, Greece in 176. Severus served as a suffect consul in 167 and an ordinary consul in 173. In the year of his second consulship, Severus became a patron and was made an honorary citizen of Pompeiopolis. In 173, an honorific inscription was dedicated to Severus in his birth city. This honorific surviving inscription was found on a statue base in the city: : For the good fortune of Gnaeus Claudius Severus who was consul twice, pontifex, son-in-law of the Emperor Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus, patron of the city, the metropolis Pompeiopolis of the province of Paphlagonia put this up in the 178th year of the province through the work of Publius Domitius Augureinus Clodius Kalbeinus the chief archon.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Hyposmocoma lunifer is a species of moth of the Cosmopterigidae family.

TopShot operates like a small photography studio that captures three-dimensional objects on a specially-designed platform on top of the MFP. It also functions as a document scanner to capture text and images that are on paper. TopShot can capture any object that fits on its scanning platform. The MFP firmware processes the data from TopShot into image files that the MFP can print (copy), send to a computer directory (using the scanner driver), send to email, and send directly to the Internet using HP ePrintCenter apps, such as eStorage. The TopShot scanner driver converts the image data into various formats (see Image file formats): TopShot also fits into an environment as a scanner of non-traditional documents, such as pages in books, artwork that does not always lie flat, or fragile documents. For example, TopShot can archive rare books or historical documents where the documents themselves are valuable artifacts. It captures the information in documents without touching them. Using a digital camera in the place of a traditional scanning mechanism presents some challenges that must be overcome for an effective scanning device: TopShot also removes the background behind the object to make the image stand out and to eliminate the need to edit the image in a separate step. The surface of the scanning platform is engineered to reduce shadows and to reflect a specific shade of white, which TopShot identifies and removes from the final image. Figure 1 shows a TopShot image of candy on the scanning platform. For documents, TopShot uses text recognition software to identify the text, to clarify it, and to match it to known fonts for printing. It also identifies graphics on the paper and optimizes them. Then, it aggregates the six exposures into a document image that appears flat, clear, and undistorted. Figure 2 shows a document captured using a smartphone camera. The image is dark, and the graphic is obscured by glare. Figure 3 shows the same document captured by TopShot in JPEG format. The text is clear, the background is white, and the image viewable. Readiris Pro Software that comes with the MFP scans documents through TWAIN and converts the text into searchable and editable text. Figure 4 shows the same document scanned using this software. Note: the document in Figure 4 is a screenshot of the scan results. The TopShot camera is placed at the end of an arm that the user must lift before scanning. The arm is just the right length to allow the camera to aim and focus properly. Since the position of the camera arm is critical to the success of capturing images, it has a detent in the fully lifted position. The TopShot camera arm looks like a handle. It looks so much like a handle that one has to resist the temptation to lift the MFP with it. Because of this, the camera arm is designed to be light enough that it feels too weak to lift the device. The panel on the device where the camera is mounted is also designed to be flexible making it even more obvious that the camera arm is not a handle. This is why HP begins most of the user documentation with a warning to resist using the camera arm as a handle. Making the camera arm lighter also costs less, which reduces the cost of the MFP.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Henrik Gál (born 5 March 1947 in Földes) is a Hungarian former wrestler who competed in the 1972 Summer Olympics and in the 1976 Summer Olympics.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"John Pearson (30 January 1902 – 23 April 1984) was an American gymnast who competed in the 1924 Summer Olympics and in the 1928 Summer Olympics.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Tugstumur Khan (1342-1348), the brother of Ayurshirdara Khan and son of Togoontumur Khan, was a Khanate ruler in the late 14th century.
