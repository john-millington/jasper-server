{"lines":[{"value":"The California Voting Rights Act of 2001 (CVRA) expands on the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, making it easier for minority groups in California to prove that their votes are being diluted in \"at-large\" elections. In 1986, the United States Supreme Court established conditions that must be met to prove that minorities are being disenfranchised; the CVRA eliminated one of these requirements. Unlike the federal Voting Rights Act, the CVRA does not require plaintiffs to demonstrate a specific geographic district where a minority is concentrated enough to establish a majority. This makes it easier for minority voters to sue local governments and eliminate at-large elections. The Act was signed into law on 9 July 2002. In 2006, California's Fifth District Court of Appeal ruled the act constitutional in Sanchez v. City of Modesto. The city claimed that the act was unconstitutional because it inherently favored people of color; the court concluded that the act was not racist in nature and returned the case to the trial court. Critics of the act argue that it inappropriately makes race a predominant factor in elections and that it does not make sense to eliminate the requirement to establish a geographic district where there is a minority concentration. Advocates argue that at-large elections allow bloc voting that effectively keeps minorities out of office.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"This is a list of the songwriting and production credits of Charles Harmon (better known as Chuck Harmony).","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The 2011 League of Ireland Premier Division was the 27th season of the League of Ireland Premier Division.

The CNLU, like other labor unions in the United States, had as its goal improving the working conditions and quality of life for its members. African Americans were excluded from existing labor unions, such as when white workers formed the National Labor Union (NLU). William Sylvis, president of the NLU, made a speech in which he agreed that there should be \"no distinction of race or nationality\" within the ranks of his organization. In 1869 several black delegates were invited to the annual meeting of the NLU, among them Isaac Myers, a prominent organizer of African-American laborers. At the convention, he spoke eloquently for solidarity, saying that white and black workers ought to organize together for higher wages and a comfortable standard of living. However, the white unions refused to allow African Americans to join their ranks. In response to this, Myers met with other African-American laborers to form a national labor organization of their own, and in 1869 the Colored National Labor Union was formed with Myers as its first president. The CNLU was established to help improve the harsh conditions facing black workers. Among the goals of the CNLU, which represented African-American laborers in 21 states, were the issuance of farmland to poor Southern African Americans, government aid for education, and new nondiscriminatory legislation that would help struggling black workers.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The Diana of Versailles is a slightly over lifesize marble statue of the Greek goddess Artemis (Latin: Diana), with a deer, located in the Musée du Louvre, Paris.

It is a large fieldstone dwelling begun, it is believed, in the 1690s and completed in 1802 on part of a 2500-acre tract named \"The Valley of Jehosaphat\" by Richard Smith, Jr., who was granted the land by Lord Baltimore in 1684 in recognition of Smith's service as the first attorney general of Maryland. Smith's descendants owned the tract until Walter Dulany bought half of it in the 1720s and the other half about 20 years later. While the origin of the name, \"Eagle's Nest\", is unknown, one possible explanation has to do with the fact that a Mr. FitzHugh of Virginia married one of famed lawyer Daniel Dulany's sisters and lived with her at \"Fitzhugh Farm\", adjoining the original \"Eagle's Nest\" to the north. The FitzHughs owned, among other properties, a plantation north of the James River named, \"Eagle's Nest\". Might Mr. FitzHugh have suggested the name? The Dulany family was a prosperous mercantile and land-owning family with an extensive trading relationship with England. Their loyalties lay with the Mother Country throughout the American Revolution, the outcome of which left them out of favor. \"The Eagle's Nest \" was confiscated and the house with some acreage was sold at sheriff's sale to Thomas Marsh, the property's overseer who lived in the house as it was then. Since the Marshes were Quakers, they had no interest in owning slaves, instead producing 10 or more children in each generation. Thomas' son, Joshua, served as a captain in the Revolution and afterward became financially successful in his management of raising and selling crops and livestock. It was he who built the main portion of the house a decade and a half after Hampton Mansion was built. A copy of his portrait still hangs in the house. The three-part house consists of a tall, -story 5-bay Georgian portion and two long -story portions. The newest portion, the garage wing, incorporates timbers salvaged from the old slave quarters before the flooding of the valley in order to create Loch Raven Reservoir. The house features a profusion of original detail including the fine main entrance, the interior woodwork, the original arcade, period outbuildings including the smokehouse, icehouse, springhouse, and root cellar. Foundation ruins of the barn, tenant farmer's house, and tollbooth still stand, though now on neighboring properties. The late-20th-century neighborhoods built on the eastern portion of the original property, including Golden Eagle, Eagle's View, Stone Eagle, and Towson Golf & Country Club (formerly Eagle's Nest Golf and Country Club) derive their names from the name of the original tract. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, and is listed on the Maryland and Baltimore County historical registers.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Aaron Wagner (born July 5, 1982) is a former Canadian football fullback/linebacker for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League.

As well as producing vegetables, Whitefield undertook a variety of traditional country crafts, and for a period was a prominent member of the Ecology Party (forerunner of the Green Party of England and Wales) and was involved in the early years of the Glastonbury music festival. He was an influential British exponent of the permaculture system from 1990, developing his own approach. He was interviewed in several television programmes advocating permaculture, including the BBC's ''It's Not Easy Being Green (2006) and A Farm for the Future'' (2008). He was the author of Tipi Living (1987), Permaculture in a Nutshell (1993), How to Make a Forest Garden (1996), The Earth Care Manual (2004), and The Living Landscape, How to Read it and Understand it (2010). The Minimalist Gardener (2017) was posthumously published. He taught on various courses in England, including at Ragmans Lane Farm in Gloucestershire and created the first online permaculture design course in Britain.

The objective of the campaign was to gain military control of the British Province of Quebec (modern day Canada), and convince French-speaking Canadians to join the revolution on the side of the Thirteen Colonies. One expedition left Fort Ticonderoga under Richard Montgomery, besieged and captured Fort St. Johns, and very nearly captured British General Guy Carleton when taking Montreal. The other expedition left Cambridge, Massachusetts under Benedict Arnold, and traveled with great difficulty through the wilderness of Maine to Quebec City. The two forces joined there, but were defeated at the Battle of Quebec in December 1775. Montgomery's expedition set out from Fort Ticonderoga in late August, and began besieging Fort St. Johns, the main defensive point south of Montreal, in mid-September. After the fort was captured in November, Carleton abandoned Montreal, fleeing to Quebec City, and Montgomery took control of the city (Montreal) before heading for Quebec with an army much reduced in size by expiring enlistments. There he joined Arnold, who had left Cambridge in early September on an arduous trek through the wilderness that left his surviving troops starving and lacking in many supplies and equipment. These forces joined before Quebec City in December, where they assaulted the city in a snowstorm on the last day of the year. The battle was a disastrous defeat for the Americans; Montgomery was killed and Arnold wounded, while the city's defenders suffered few casualties. Arnold then conducted an ineffectual siege on the city, during which Loyalist sentiments were boosted by successful propaganda campaigns, and General David Wooster's blunt administration of Montreal served to annoy both supporters and detractors of the Americans. The British sent several thousand troops, including General John Burgoyne and Hessian allies, to reinforce those in the province in May 1776. General Carleton then launched a counter-offensive, ultimately driving the smallpox-weakened and disorganized American forces back to Fort Ticonderoga. The Americans, under Arnold's command, were able to hinder the British advance sufficiently that an attack could not be mounted on Fort Ticonderoga in 1776. The end of the campaign set the stage for Burgoyne's campaign of 1777 to gain control of the Hudson River valley.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Beth Anderson is an American neo-romantic composer.

The term is variously applied to plants, bacteria, protozoa, animals, chemical compounds, etc. The antonymous term is \"acidophile\". Cf. \"alkaliphile\". Plants are known to be well-defined with respect to their pH tolerance, and only a small number of species thrive well under a broad range of acidity. Therefore the categorization acidophile/acidophobe is well-defined. Sometimes a complementary classification is used (calcicole/calcifuge, with calcicoles being \"lime-loving\" plants). In gardening, soil pH is a measure of acidity or alkalinity of soil, with pH=7 indicating the neutral soil. Therefore acydophobes would prefer pH above 7. Acid intolerance of plants may be mitigated by lime addition and by calcium and nitrogen fertilizers. Acidophobic species are used as a natural instrument of monitoring the degree of acidifying contamination of soil and watercourses. For example, when monitoring vegetation, a decrease of acidophobic species would be indicative of acid rain increase in the area. A similar approach is used with aquatic species.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Funcrusher Plus is the debut studio album by American hip hop group Company Flow.

Group N cars dominated the championship for many years but in recent years cars built to R5 and S2000 regulations have tended to be the frontrunners. The championship was first held in 1988, created out of the successful expansion of the World Rally Championship into Asia and linking with the debut of Rally Australia and won by Japan's Kenjiro Shinozuka in a Mitsubishi Galant VR-4. Initially the championship had strong support from World Rally Championship teams, aided by more than half the calendar being WRC rallies and by Japanese manufacturers backing half of the front runners with Mazda, Toyota, Mitsubishi and Subaru all running front running teams. Toyota's double World Rally Champion Carlos Sainz won the championship in 1990, Juha Kankkunen, Didier Auriol, Colin McRae, Tommi Makinen, Richard Burns, Richard Burns and Ari Vatanen all won rallies. Several WRC teams used the championship as a junior development squad. By the late 1990s, the big teams were dropping away from the championship, or were running drivers from the region. The 2000 Rally New Zealand was the last joint WRC/APRC event and the WRC teams and manufacturers left and regional teams, like Subaru's New Zealand based team and regional manufacturers like Proton were sharing the wins with privately run teams. The shift to Group N and away from WRC regulations assisted as only Subaru and Mitsubishi had eligible cars for Group N. By the mid-2000s the teams were all privateers. The growth of Super 2000 regulations saw manufacturer teams return led by Proton. In recent years (since 2013) Skoda have used the championship to develop young European-based drivers, with Esapekka Lappi, Jan Kopecký, Pontus Tidemand and Ole Christian Veiby all going on to compete at WRC WRC-2 level. The championship has also been a proving ground for regional talent, even when World Rally teams were competing regional drivers from Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Malaysian driver Karamjit Singh brought the first victory for a driver from one of the emerging APRC nations with Jean-Louis Leyraud from the French pacific island of New Caledonia and India's Gaurav Gill followed. The occasional European driver has moved into the region to find a cheaper series to compete in instead of the expensive European Rally Championship, like Jussi Valimaki. Reflecting its roots as a subsidiary of the World Rally Championship it had class championships within the main championship for Group N cars and naturally aspirated Two Litre cars. In ore modern times the sub-classes have been split geographically rather than technically, allowing competitors to compete for smaller portions of the series to bolster flagging entry numbers. The championships created were the Asia Cup, taking in Asian continent events in Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and China with Thailand joining in 2003. The Pacific Cup takes in Oceania events in Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia. By taking victory at the 2009 Indonesian Rally, Australian Cody Crocker became the most successful driver in APRC history, winning his fourth consecutive title, all in Subarus. A trio of drivers have won three APRC titles; New Zealander Possum Bourne, Kenneth Eriksson of Sweden, and Malaysia's Karamjit Singh. The championship presently has events in New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Japan, China and India.

The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe participated in industrial activity in recognition of the need for it to reduce costs, wherever possible, while at the same time fulfilling its mandate. Development work has also continued over the years, through the acquisition of technology, to produce new products and value add to its precious metals pool and, established a coin minting facility. This was another example of the Bank's participation in industry, to enable it to discharge its obligation more efficiently by supplying coin at sustainable cost. The Commissioning of the Zimbabwe Mint was therefore, an example of the many other positive developments taking place in Zimbabwe, which have, unfortunately, tended to be buried under a barrage of negative publicity. The cooperating partners were Giesecke & Devrient for bank notes and, the Bavarian Mint for coinage. When the Z$500 million mint was commissioned by President Robert Mugabe, it was argued that it would save the country US$50 million in foreign currency because it was costing the country 150 cents to import a 10-cent piece, for example.

Thacker, USAF (Ret.) (born February 21, 1918) is a retired test pilot, a lifelong aeromodeling enthusiast and designer, one of the few pilots in history to do tours of duty in two different theaters of operation (Europe and the Pacific) in World War II and the holder of a number of aviation records. Thacker's interest in aviation was sparked in 1926 at age eight when a neighbor purchased an operating model aircraft. By 1929, Thacker had completed his first model, that of the Spirit of St. Louis, and went on to earn spending money building balsa gliders. He joined his first aeromodeling club in El Centro, California in 1932. He would also become the Southern California yo-yo champion that year; his prize was $40.00 in the form of $25, $10 and $5 gold coins. In wartime, Thacker flew two tours of duty in a B-17 in World War II, a single tour in the Korean War with a B-29 Superfortress and classified high-altitude reconnaissance missions during the Vietnam War. His initiation into World War II came when he was one of the pilots of a flight of 12 B-17s bound for the Philippines via Hawaii; they arrived in Hawaii just before 8:00 am on December 7, 1941, in the midst of the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. His wartime service earned him two Silver Stars, three Distinguished Flying Crosses, ten Air Medals and the French Croix de Guerre with Palm. A graduate of the Air Force Test Pilot Academy at California's Edwards Air Force Base, Thacker was responsible for testing a wide variety of aircraft between 1939 and 1970, including the first accelerated tests of the P-80 combat-ready jet fighter, assisted by then Captain Chuck Yeager. His most notable achievement came in 1947 with his test of Betty Jo, a North American F-82 Twin Mustang named after his wife. This was to be the first nonstop test of a fully laden fighter between Honolulu, Hawaii and New York City, New York. The 14-hour-32-minute test, which started at Hickam Air Force Base on February 27 and which ended at LaGuardia Airport was a success; Thacker even set the speed record at an average of . Both the aircraft and the flight jacket Thacker wore are on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. His co-pilot on the trip was Lieutenant John Ard. The trip remains the longest and fastest ever by a propeller-driven fighter. Another notable achievement came in 1972 as the test pilot of a solar-powered aircraft designed and built by Lockheed. On January 9, 2010, Colonel Thacker was inducted into the Academy of Model Aeronautics Hall of Fame for his work in both model and full-scale aviation during day two of the AMA's annual exposition at the Ontario Convention Center, Ontario, California. Among the dignitaries present were then-AMA president Dave Brown and retired space shuttle commander Robert \"Hoot\" Gibson, himself a strong supporter of the AMA. Thacker presently reside in San Clemente, California; he remains active in the hobby of radio-controlled model aviation as an active AMA member, and frequently participates in meets in and around Southern California with his giant-scale, turbine-powered F-15 Eagle. He turned 100 in February 2018.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is a side-scrolling platform video game developed by id Software and published by Softdisk in 1991 for DOS.

The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, in an adventure in his dreams as he journeys through a vegetable kingdom to defeat the evil potato king Boobus Tuber and free enslaved children from the Dream machine. The game features Keen running and jumping through various levels while opposed by various vegetable enemies; unlike the prior three episodes, Keen does not use a pogo stick to jump higher, and throws flower power pellets to temporarily turn enemies into flowers rather than shooting a raygun to kill them. After the success of Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, the developers of the game, including programmers John Carmack and John Romero, designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack, left their jobs at Softdisk to found id Software. As part of a settlement for using company resources to make their own game, the group agreed to make several games for Softdisk's Gamer's Edge subscription service. As a part of fulfilling this obligation, id made Keen Dreams as a prototype to develop ideas for their next major Keen game, Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy.

Keen Dreams was not as widely played or noted as the other Keen games, and as it was owned by Softdisk was included in only one of the several compilation releases of the series by id or regular publisher Apogee Software; as a result, it became known as the \"lost episode\" of the series.

It premiered at the Opéra-Comique, Paris on 25 June 1806. The libretto is by Claude Godard d'Aucourt de Saint-Just. The plot concerns the love affair of King Henri IV with Gabrielle d'Estrées. The opera was removed from the repertoire after its sixth performance on 5 July. According to Arthur Pougin, this was due to the weakness of the work, especially its libretto. However, the musicologist Elizabeth Bartlet believes it was suspended for political reasons. In 1805, Napoleon - then ruler of France - had written to his chief of police Joseph Fouché that he did not want to see Henri IV on stage because the king was too close in time \"not to arouse passions. The stage needs a little bit of antiquity and, without causing the theatre too much trouble, I think you ought to prevent this [i.e. showing Henri IV on stage], without appearing to intervene.\" Méhul's nephew Joseph Daussoigne-Méhul planned a revival in 1818 but it never took place.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Angela Berry (born August 7, 1968) is an American retired soccer player.

The company's predecessors were Tamandare Explorations Inc. which had been formed in 2007 as a mining wildcat vehicle focused on land in Nevada and the shares of which were traded over the counter, and L & L Technologies, LLC, which had been formed in 1996 by Seth Lederman and Donald Landry to repurpose drugs for CNS development. L&L had formed Janus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which later became Vela Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to develop some of its inventions, and Vela returned those assets to L&L in 2006. L&L placed them in a subsidiary called Krele Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and that subsidiary and Tamandare Explorations Inc. performed a reverse merger in October 2011; the new entity was renamed Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. and Lederman was named CEO. It was listed on the NASDAQ exchange in 2013 under the symbol TNXP. As of 2013 its lead candidates were a reformulation of cyclobenzaprine as a tablet for sublingual administration called TNX-102 SL (formerly called VLD-cyclobenzaprine and then KRL-102), which was under development for fibromyalgia and with preclinical efforts underway for posttraumatic stress disorder, TNX-201 (a single-racemate formulation of isometheptene mucate the company was considering for some headaches), and TNX-301, (a combination drug with disulfiram and selegiline for treatment for alcohol abuse). In September 2016 Tonix reported the failure of its Phase III trial of TNX-102 for fibromyalgia and said it was abandoning that line of development. Tonix continued work on TNX-102 SL in PTSD; the IND for that use had been accepted in 2014 and in December 2016 after the Phase IIa trial was done, TNX-102 was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA. It had entered Phase 3 development as of March 2017. In July 2017 the news division of the journal, Science, reported that Tonix had been sponsoring research and collaborating with scientists at the University of Alberta, David Evans and Ryan Noyce, and that the work had led to the generation of an extinct horsepox virus using synthetic biology — the lab had bought pieces of DNA from a reagent company and had built the horsepox genome with them. This dual-use research is controversial. The work had not been published as of July 2017 but had been discussed at a WHO meeting in November 2016. This invention was licensed to Tonix and Tonix announced that it intended to further develop it into a smallpox vaccine, which is a biodefense business model.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Newell Beach is a beach and small town located near Port Douglas in far north Queensland, Australia.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Trosia nigrorufa is a moth of the family Megalopygidae.

After the decision is made, the remaining processes are put back to sleep, only to all wake up again to request access to the resource.

Barbour had been accompanied by Cervera on his previous visits to Cuba, and on hearing of the strange birds to be found in the Zapata area, he sent the Spaniard on a series of trips into the region, eventually leading to the finding of the wren. The bird's song is similar to that of the house wren, in that it is high-pitched and loud, described as a \"musical warble preceded by guttural note, given in series of three or four phrases.\" The Zapata wren's habitat is typically freshwater marsh and lowland savanna with scattered bushes and low trees. It feeds on insects, spiders, small snails, lizards and berries. The wren typically makes its nest in sawgrass tussocks. It is thought to breed between January and July.

It was created in 1999 by its two original co-hosts, Adam Carolla and Jimmy Kimmel and their executive producer Daniel Kellison. The Man Show simultaneously celebrated and lampooned the stereotypical loutish male perspective in a sexually charged, humorous light. The show consisted of a variety of pre-recorded comedy sketches and live in-studio events, usually requiring audience participation. The Man Show is particularly well known for its buxom female models, the Juggy Dance Squad, who would dance in themed, revealing costumes at the opening of every show, and in the aisles of the audience just before The Man Show went to commercial break and end the shows with the \"Girls on Trampolines\" segment. The first year of The Man Show featured beer-guzzling entertainer Bill 'The Fox' Foster as the show's emcee. Foster specialized in chugging two beers in record time (sometimes while suspended upside down) and singing lewd drinking songs. He would close every episode by leading the audience in the German drinking toast Zicke, Zacke, Zicke, Zacke, Hoi, Hoi, Hoi!, a tradition that continued after his death from prostate cancer in 2000.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"'''Blundell's School''' is a co-educational day and boarding independent school located in the town of Tiverton in the county of Devon, England.

A confusing history has emerged from the practise of retitling films for release in different countries, in which a given film may have a different title in each country in which it is released. In Britain, these films were released as the 'Zombie Flesh Eaters series'. In North America, these same films became known as the 'Zombie series'. For the European release of Romero's Dawn of the Dead, the film was re-edited by Dario Argento and re-scored by Goblin, and retitled Zombi. Following its success, a zombie film by Lucio Fulci that was already in production was retitled Zombi 2 to appear as an ersatz sequel.

Protection is necessary as many nations and companies are planning on returning to the Moon, and it is not difficult to imagine the damage an autonomous vehicle or an errant astronaut—an explorer, colonist or tourist—could to one of the Moon landing sites, whether intentionally or unintentionally.

In the work Bakhtin explores Gargantua and Pantagruel by the French Renaissance writer François Rabelais. Bakhtin argues that for centuries Rabelais’s book has been misunderstood. Bakhtin attempts to redress this and clarify Rabelais's intentions through two methods: recovery of sections of Gargantua and Pantagruel that were previously either ignored or suppressed, and analysis of the Renaissance social system in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language that was not. Through this analysis, Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts: carnival (carnivalesque) which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and grotesque realism, which is defined as a literary mode. Thus, in Rabelais and His World Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body. As written, Rabelais and His World not only examines the openness of Gargantua and Pantagruel, it also serves as an example of such openness.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Khayr al-Nisa Begum (known under the royal title Mahd-i Ulya, \"the highest-ranked cradle\") (died 26 July 1579) was an Iranian Mazandarani princess from the Marashi dynasty, who was the wife of the Safavid shah (king) Mohammed Khodabanda (r. 1578–1587) and mother of Abbas I.

He was Professor at the Paris 13 University (University of Paris-Nord) and president of the World Organization of Systems and Cybernetics (WOSC),. At the beginning of the 1950s, Vallée wrote his first publications on what he named \"opérateur d'observation\" (which means in English \"operator of observation\"). The latter, in the simplest case, allows a cybernetic system to observe the state of its environment and itself. Thereafter, on the basis of these results, a decisional operator will be able to indicate the action to be taken. The two stages of perception and decision are distinguished by \"intellectual convenience\", but it is interesting to gather them in a unique operator, known as \"pragmatic\". A decision is influenced by the observation of events, but also by past perceptions. That means that, in the observation made at a given moment, traces of past observations are also present. Eventually, these processes follow one another in a loop. Vallée defined the study of this situation with the term \"epistemo-praxeology\", underlining the existing link between knowledge (episteme), resulting from observation, and action (praxis). Regarding the observation problem, Vallée was also interested in information theory. Vallée also nourished private interests in sociological problems as well as in history. The first led him to describe a cybernetic creature covering the whole surface of the globe with its communication net (1952), an idea which has also been proposed (under the name of \"cybionte\", 1975) by Joël de Rosnay. He also wrote articles devoted to historical aspects of cybernetics and systems, referring to René Descartes, Louis de Broglie, and Norbert Wiener.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"\"Why\" is a dance single by D Mob with Cathy Dennis.
