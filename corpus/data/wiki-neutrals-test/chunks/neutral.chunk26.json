English in origin, it depends on grace and charm rather than grandeur and formal structure. Homely and functional gardens connected to working-class cottages go back centuries, but their stylized reinvention occurred in 1870s England, as a reaction to the more structured, rigorously maintained estate gardens with their formal designs and mass plantings of greenhouse annuals. The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than today's, with emphasis on vegetables and herbs, fruit trees, perhaps a beehive, and even livestock. Flowers, used to fill spaces, gradually became more dominant. The traditional cottage garden was usually enclosed, perhaps with a rose-bowered gateway. Flowers common to early cottage gardens included traditional florists' flowers such as primroses and violets, along with flowers with household use such as calendula and various herbs. Others were the richly scented old-fashioned roses that bloomed once a year, and simple flowers like daisies. In time, cottage-garden sections were added to some large estate gardens as well. Modern cottage gardens include countless regional and personal variations and embrace plant materials, such as ornamental grasses or native plants not seen in the rural gardens of cottagers. Traditional roses, with their full fragrance and lush foliage, continue to be a cottage-garden mainstay — along with modern disease-resistant varieties that retain traditional attributes. Informal climbing plants, whether traditional or modern hybrids, are also common, as are the self-sowing annuals and freely spreading perennials favoured in traditional cottagers' gardens.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Jill Ann Trenary (born August 1, 1968) is an American figure skater.

He was the first Florida Republican elected to Congress since 1880, shortly after the end of Reconstruction. He was re-elected, serving without interruption until 1970. In Congress Cramer became a ranking member of the Roads subcommittee of the Committee on Public Works, and influenced national highway policy at a time of major expansion, ensuring that Interstates were kept toll-free. He gained extra funding to link Tampa and Miami, in a federal interstate project built in Florida. He was instrumental in the revival of the Republican Party in Florida through the mid-20th century, taking advantage of the state's changing demographics and new Republican migrants from the North and Midwest, and attracting Cuban Americans and other minorities to the party. Beginning in 1964, Cramer represented the state for 20 years on the Republican National Committee and served as its counsel for six years. The long absence of Republican officials from state office and weakened condition of the party was due to suppression of black and Republican voting in the 19th century, and the disenfranchisement of African Americans at the turn of the century, as they had constituted the majority of the Republican Party.

They should be provided with a shelter (such as a plastic tube or driftwood) in which to hide. They prefer a dimly lit tank as their eyesight is optimized for low light. Black ghost knife fish are weakly electric fish. They will eat smaller fish in the tank and are intolerant of conspecifics. As with other scaleless fish, they are vulnerable to parasite infestations such as ich (Ichthyophthirius multifiliis). They can reproduce in captivity, although there are only a few reports of Black Ghost Knifefish reproducing.== -->The black ghost knifefish is a weakly electric fish as a result of the electromotor and electrosensory systems it possesses. While some fish can only receive electric signals, the black ghost knifefish can both produce and sense the electrical impulses. Electrogenesis occurs when a specialized electric organ found in the tail of the fish generates electrical signals, which are thus called electric organ discharges (EODs). Then, for these EODs to be sensed by the fish, electroreception occurs when groups of sensory cells embedded in the skin, known as electroreceptor organs, detect the electrical change. The EODs are used for two major purposes: electrolocation and communication. The kind of EOD produced can be used to distinguish between two types of weakly electric fish: the pulse-type and the wave-type. The black ghost knifefish are considered to be the latter type, because they can continuously generate EODs in small intervals. Wave-type EODs have a narrow power spectra, and can be heard as a tonal sound, where the discharge rate establishes the fundamental frequency. By emitting its own continuous sinusoidal train of EODs, the fish can determine the presence of nearby objects by sensing perturbations in timing and amplitude of electric fields, an ability known as active electrolocation. The particular organs used to sense the self-generated high-frequency EODs are tuberous electroreceptor organs. On the other hand, when low-frequency electric fields are generated by external sources instead of the fish itself, a different class of electroreceptor organs is used for this passive electrolocation, called ampullary organs. Therefore, the black ghost knifefish uses an active and a passive electrosystem, each with its own corresponding receptor organs. The fish can also use a mechanosensory lateral line system, which detects water disturbances created by the motion of the fish's body. As nocturnal hunters, the fish can rely on all three systems to navigate through dark environments and detect their prey. Each species has a characteristic EOD baseline frequency range, which varies with sex and age within the species, as well. The baseline frequency is maintained to be almost constant at stable temperature, but will usually be changed due to the presence of others of the same species. Such changes in frequency relevant to social interaction are called frequency modulations (FMs). The role these FMs have in communication is significant, as black ghost knifefish have developed jamming avoidance responses, which are behavioral responses that avoid the overlapping of EOD frequencies between conspecific individuals to prevent sensory confusion. Moreover, a study was conducted that focused on sexual dimorphism in electrocommunication signals. Female black ghost knifefish generate EODs at a higher frequency than the males, an FM which can be used for gender recognition. A study found the subdominant black ghost knifefish exhibited noticeable gradual frequency rises (GFRs) in their EODs whereas the dominant fish did not, supporting the researchers' hypothesis that GFRs during communication are indicative of submissive signals.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Historically, the term 'Kosmobiologie' was used by the German medical astrologer Friedrich Feerhow and Swiss statistician Karl Krafft in a more general sense \"to designate that branch of astrology working on scientific foundations and keyed to the natural sciences\". The term Cosmobiology was popularized in English after the translation of the writings of Reinhold Ebertin, who based a large part of his techniques on the midpoint-astrology work of Alfred Witte The term Cosmobiology as most frequently used in the English language, refers to the school of astrology founded by Ebertin. The main difference between Witte's Hamburg School and Ebertin's Cosmobiology is that Cosmobiology rejects the hypothetical Trans-Neptunian objects used by the Hamburg School and practitioners of Uranian astrology. Another difference is the significant expansion of Cosmobiology into medical astrology, Dr. Ebertin being a physician. Cosmobiology continued Witte's ultimate primary emphasis on the use of astrological midpoints along with the following 8th-harmonic aspects in the natal chart, which both Witte and Ebertin found to be the most potent in terms of personal influence: conjunction (0°), semi-square (45°), square (90°), sesquiquadrate (135°), and opposition (180°). In cosmobiological analysis, planets are inserted into a special type of horoscope often referred to as a 'Cosmogram' (derived from the Uranian 90° dial chart) and delineated. The primary reference/research text for Cosmobiology was first published in 1940 by the German astrologer Reinhold Ebertin. The name of the book is The Combination of Stellar Influences. The original German title is Kombination der Gestirneinflusse. Its foundations were derived largely from the early versions of the \"Regelwerk für Planetenbilder\" by Alfred Witte, and then further built upon by Ebertin and colleagues. Ebertin defined Cosmobiology as the following: \"Cosmobiology is a scientific discipline concerned with the possible correlation between the cosmos and organic life and the effects of cosmic rhythms and stellar motion on man, with all his potentials and dispositions, his character and the possible turns of fate; it also researches these correlation and effects as mirrored by earth's plant and animal life as a whole. In this endeavor, Cosmobiology utilises modern-day methods of scientific research, such as statistics, analysis, and computer programming. It is of prime importance, however, in view of the scientific effort expended, not to overlook the macrocosmic and microcosmic interrelations incapable of measurement.\" What is noteworthy about both Cosmobiology and Uranian astrology, which has developed along a different path technically, is their emphasis on critical analysis and testing by observing more clearly measurable or observable astrological correlations, rather than to simply perpetuate observations or assumptions written in historical astrological texts, a problem leading to widespread criticism of mainstream Classical Astrology. Some have speculated that the term \"Cosmobiology\" was coined specifically to divorce its precepts from the manifold ambiguities of, and subsequent widespread biases against, Classical Astrology. Three prominent published Cosmobiological authors in the English language are German-American cosmobiologist Eleonora Kimmel, American cosmobiologist Aren Ober (formerly Savalan), and Australian cosmobiologist Doris Greaves, all of whom have published texts in Cosmobiology based on their own substantial experiences.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Linguistic purism or linguistic protectionism is the practice of defining or recognizing one variety of a language as being purer or of intrinsically higher quality than other varieties. Linguistic purism was institutionalized through language academies (of which the 1572 Accademia della Crusca set a model example in Europe), and their decisions often have the force of law. The perceived or actual decline identified by the purists may take the form of change of vocabulary, syncretism of grammatical elements, or loanwords. Linguistic purism is a form of prescriptive linguistics. The unwanted similarity is often with a neighboring language whose speakers are culturally or politically dominant. The abstract ideal may invoke logic, clarity, or the grammar of \"classic\" languages. It is often presented as conservative, as a \"protection\" of a language from the \"aggression\" of other languages or of \"conservation\" of the national Volksgeist, but is often innovative in defining a new standard. It is sometimes part of governmental language policy which is enforced in various ways.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Cal Northern School of Law is a private law school located in Chico, California.

Swinney was a known criminal with a history of counterfeiting and auto-theft. He was linked to the murders by statements from his wife, Peggy, who refused to testify against him in court. Two of the lead investigators in the case, Max Tackett and [[Texarkana Moonlight Murders#Miller County Chief Sheriff.27s Deputy Tillman B. Johnson|Tillman Johnson]], believed for the remainder of their lives that Swinney was guilty of the murders. Swinney grew up in rural Cleveland County, Arkansas, the son of a Baptist minister. Swinney was convicted of auto-theft in 1947 and as a repeat offender, he received life in prison. However, he was released from prison in 1973 following a habeas corpus proceeding which found that a prior conviction in 1941 used for sentence enhancement purposes was void because Swinney had not been represented by counsel. Investigation into his involvement in the murders eventually faded away. The case remains unsolved, and physical evidence is virtually nonexistent today.

The seven-year contract to run the Connexions Card was won by Capita, signed in July 2001, and operated as a Public-Private Partnership with a budget of £109million. The scheme flopped and was terminated in the summer of 2006 with a saving of £23million.

Indeed, the only young people to use the cards were those who didn't have a problem in the first place. The inflexible contract with Capita was also singled out as a barrier to targeting the product more effectively.

The main purpose of the Act is to partially compensate the nuclear industry against liability claims arising from nuclear incidents while still ensuring compensation coverage for the general public. The Act establishes a no fault insurance-type system in which the first approximately $12.6 billion (as of 2011) is industry-funded as described in the Act. Any claims above the $12.6 billion would be covered by a Congressional mandate to retroactively increase nuclear utility liability or would be covered by the federal government. At the time of the Act's passing, it was considered necessary as an incentive for the private production of nuclear power — this was because electric utilities viewed the available liability coverage (only $60 million) as inadequate. In 1978, the Act survived a constitutional challenge in the Supreme Court case Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group (see below).

In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary. Nonfiction's specific factual assertions and descriptions may or may not be accurate, and can give either a true or a false account of the subject in question. However, authors of such accounts genuinely believe or claim them to be truthful at the time of their composition or, at least, pose them to a convinced audience as historically or empirically factual. Reporting the beliefs of others in a nonfiction format is not necessarily an endorsement of the ultimate veracity of those beliefs, it is simply saying it is true that people believe them (for such topics as mythology). Nonfiction can also be written about fiction, typically known as literary criticism, giving information and analysis on these other works. Nonfiction need not necessarily be written text, since pictures and film can also purport to present a factual account of a subject.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"1977 in sports describes the year's events in world sport.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Roaring Forties are strong westerly winds found in the Southern Hemisphere, generally between the latitudes of 40 and 50 degrees.

A galvanometer works as an actuator, by producing a rotary deflection (of a \"pointer\"), in response to electric current flowing through a coil in a constant magnetic field. Early galvanometers were not calibrated, but their later developments were used as measuring instruments, called ammeters, to measure the current flowing through an electric circuit. Galvanometers developed from the observation that the needle of a magnetic compass is deflected near a wire that has electric current flowing through it, first described by Hans Oersted in 1820. They were the first instruments used to detect and measure small amounts of electric currents. André-Marie Ampère, who gave mathematical expression to Ørsted's discovery and named the instrument after the Italian electricity researcher Luigi Galvani, who in 1791 discovered the principle of the frog galvanoscope – that electric current would make the legs of a dead frog jerk. Sensitive galvanometers have been essential for the development of science and technology in many fields. For example, they enabled long range communication through submarine cables, such as the earliest Transatlantic telegraph cables, and were essential to discovering the electrical activity of the heart and brain, by their fine measurements of current. Galvanometers also had widespread use as the visualising part in other kinds of analog meters, for example in light meters, VU meters, etc., where they were used to measure and display the output of other sensors. Today the main type of galvanometer mechanism, still in use, is the moving coil, D'Arsonval/Weston type.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Simcoe is an unincorporated community and former town in Southwestern Ontario, Canada near Lake Erie.

Over the span of three years more than 16,000 solar home systems have been financed through 2,000 bank branches, particularly in rural areas of South India where the electricity grid does not yet extend. Launched in 2003, the Indian Solar Loan Programme was a four-year partnership between UNEP, the UNEP Risoe Centre, and two of India's largest banks, the Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank. The Indian Solar Loan Program was established in 2003 in the Karnataka State of Southern India, in order to bring Solar Home Systems (SHS) to rural households in the area. Historically, the Karnataka State has relied on kerosene lanterns for light. This option is not nearly as bright as solar options. It also poses a higher risk of danger, as kerosene lanterns emit unhealthy smoke and fumes, and they are known to burn people. Also, much of rural India has little to no access to the electric grid. Therefore SHS is a highly effective lighting system available to this area due to its reliability and its low impact on the environment, however it is more expensive than other lighting options, which is why loans are necessary in order for it to be successfully implemented in rural India. Loans from the Indian Solar Loan Programme are available to households and small businesses. Borrowers pay for 15% of the lighting system up front and then continue to repay the loan over the course of 5 years. This program works well in India because of its previously established solar lighting vendors, and because of its already successful banking system. In India, banks are required to lend 40% of their loans to “priority purposes” - causes that have a positive social impact. Because the Indian Solar Loan Program involves a feasible social benefit, many Indian banks have gotten involved. In fact, 1/3 of the bank branches in Karnataka are involved in the program. The following banks are a part of the Indian Solar Loan Program: Canara Bank, Tungabhadra Grameen, Chitradurga Grameen, Sahyadri Grameen, Kolar Grameen, Syndicate Bank, Bijapur Grameen, Malaprabha Grameen, Varada Grameen, Netravathi Grameen. Vendors involved in the program are: Kotak Urja Private Limited, Selco Solar Light Private Limited, Shell Solar India Private Limited, Tata BP Solar India Limited. The Indian Solar Loan Programme is only available to people living above the poverty line. People living below the poverty line can access Solar Home Systems from Self Help Groups. The Indian Solar Loan Programme however does give loans to these Self Help Groups, therefore allowing people living below the poverty line to access Solar Home Systems. According to surveys recording customer satisfaction, recipients of loans have been overall happy with the program. 5% of customers reported they found the program to be “very good”, 92% said it was “good” and 3% said they were “unhappy” with the outcome of their involvement. Though this program is still most present in the Karnataka State, similar programs have also begun in nearby Kerala State and Andhra Pradesh State.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Transformers is a platform shoot 'em up game based on the Transformers franchise.

The books and movies that came out in quick succession anticipate current production methods of Hollywood, in two respects: First, the authors distributed the writing among themselves; their \"working method was to draw up the general plot between them and then go off and write alternate chapters independently of each other, meeting up to tie the two halves of the story together in the final chapter.\" This approach allowed the authors to produce almost one novel per month. Second, the movie rights to the books were immediately snapped up. Such a system ensured that the film studio could produce sequels reliably. The popular depiction of Fantômas as wearing a blue mask, black gloves, and using technological devices did not originate in the novels, but is a result of the popularity of the trilogy of Fantômas movies directed by André Hunebelle in the 1960s. The trilogy, which started in 1963 with Fantômas, departed considerably from the novels by giving the story a more comedic tone, and by making Fantômas (played by Jean Marais) more of a James Bond enemy. Despite these discrepancies, the blue-masked Fantômas is arguably the one that is most easily remembered.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":":For other people with the same name, see: John Howe.

The original Facelift track listing credited only vocalist Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell with writing the song. All post-Facelift compilations credited the entire band. It is unclear as to why the songwriter credits were changed.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Washdown (also wash down) is the process of high-pressure cleaning with water and/or chemicals in industries such as food and beverage and pharmaceuticals. A washdown is usually a manual operation and is designed to kill bacteria and other microorganisms. Automatic cleaning of industrial equipment is often carried out by clean-in-place (CIP) and/or steam-in-place (SIP) operations. CIP(CIP) systems often make use of programmable controllers and SCADA software. Washdown is the process of using a stream of water to clean a flat or nearly flat outside surface. Typically the area cleaned is a large expanse of concrete or asphalt. The area is cleaned of dirt and debris by the use of the force and dissolving power of stream of water as projected from a hose. Generally, one person holds and aims the hose, though if the hose is longer than 300 feet then another person may be required to help move the hose itself. Water is typically squirted from the hose at a pressure of 300 psi. The hose itself can vary in length from 75 to 425 feet. Though typically the hose when used by a single person is 300 feet long. The hose itself carries water from a water main which attaches to the hose through what is called a “stinger“. The stinger screws into the water main pipe and is held there. Also, the stinger as it is pushed down into the water supply pipe opens a seal which releases the water into the hose. At the other end of the hose a nozzle regulates the flow of water and allows for a large fanned-out spray, as well as a more concentrated stream termed a needlepoint.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"FreeBIX is a non-profit Internet Exchange Point (IXP) created in 2003.
