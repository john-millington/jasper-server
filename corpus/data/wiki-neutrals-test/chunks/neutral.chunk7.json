The number of associate justices is determined by the United States Congress and is currently set at eight by the Judiciary Act of 1869. Like the chief justice, associate justices are nominated by the President of the United States and are confirmed by the United States Senate by majority vote. This is provided for in Article II of the Constitution, which states that the president \"shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint... Judges of the Supreme Court.\" Although the Constitution refers to them as \"Judges of the Supreme Court\", the title actually used is \"Associate Justice\", introduced in the Judiciary Act of 1789. Associate justices were traditionally styled \"Mr. Justice\" in court opinions, but the title was shortened to \"Justice\" in 1980, a year before Sandra Day O'Connor became the first female justice. Article III of the Constitution specifies that associate justices, and all other United States federal judges \"shall hold their Offices during good Behavior\". This language means that the appointments are effectively for life, and that, once [[Appointment and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States#Confirmation|confirmed]], a justice's tenure of office ends only when they die, retire, resign, or are removed from office through the impeachment process. Each Supreme Court justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it; the chief justice's vote counts no more than that of any other justice. However, in drafting opinions, the chief justice enjoys additional influence in case disposition if in the majority through his power to assign who writes the opinion. Otherwise, the senior justice in the majority assigns the writing of a decision. Furthermore, the chief justice leads the discussion of the case among the justices. The chief justice has certain administrative responsibilities that the other justices do not and is paid slightly more ($255,500 per year, as opposed to $244,400 per year for each associate justice ). Associate justices have seniority by order of appointment, although the chief justice is always considered to be the most senior. If two justices are appointed on the same day, the older is designated the senior justice of the two. Currently, the senior associate justice is Anthony Kennedy. By tradition, when the justices are in conference deliberating the outcome of cases before the Court, the justices state their views in order of seniority. The senior associate justice is also tasked with carrying out the chief justices's duties when he is unable to, or if that office is vacant.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Osterdock is a city located in Clayton County, Iowa.

She gives rich praise to the work of performers and directors she admires, for example, Molly Ringwald's performance in Sixteen Candles, - Steve Martin, Robin Williams, and Nick Nolte, ( three perennial Kael favourites), and Luchino Visconti, for his work on The Leopard - \"The Leopard is so beautifully felt that it calls up a whole culture. It casts an intelligent spell - intelligent and rapturous.\" (Though  Visconti's film had originally been released in 1963, Kael is here reviewing the release of a full length three hours and five minutes version).

By trade a strong, hard-tackling midfielder who could also play in attack, Adonkor had become a 'rock' (in Suaudeau's words) in the heart of Nantes's defence when his career was cut brutally short. Driving back from Saint Nazaire to Nantes with his teammates Jean-Michel Labejof (who died) and Sidi Kabahe (who survived, but never played again), he was the victim of a fatal car crash. Adonkor was then widely tipped to become a French international. The news of Adonkor's death was passed on to Marcel Desailly by his close friend and teammate Didier Deschamps. Adonkor was Desailly's role model. Adonkor was an impressive centre back who was close to Marcel, when the news had broke Marcel was deeply saddened however was determined to make the rest of his career a tribute to his late half brother. Adonkor was hugely successful at FC Nantes academy and was tipped to be a regular starter in the team. However this was not to be with the events that had occurred in November 1984. Seth has always been remembered by FC Nantes fans as the one with a lot of promise but was taken too early.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Thomas Circle Singers (TCS) is an independent chamber chorus located in Washington, D.C.

Grafulla (1812–1880) was a composer in the United States during the 19th Century, most noted for martial music for regimental bands during the early days of the American Civil War. Grafulla was born in 1812 on Menorca, an island off the coast of Spain that was occupied by the British after the Napoleonic wars. At the age of 28, he emigrated to the United States, where he became a French horn player in Napier Lothian's New York Brass Band in New York City. This band was attached to the 7th Regiment of the New York National Guard, which was honored in 1922 by John Philip Sousa's The Gallant Seventh march. In 1860, he added woodwinds to a reorganized band and continued to serve as its director until his death in 1880. Grafulla was a quiet, unassuming man who never married; his whole life centered on his music. His remarkable technical and musical skills allowed him to become well known as a composer, often writing music to order, and as an arranger. As a director of the 7th Regiment Band, his fame spread widely. Grafulla composed Washington Grays in 1861 for the 8th Regiment, New York State Militia. This work has been called a march masterpiece, a band classic, and the prototype of the concert march. Showing the stylistic influence of both German and Italian marches, the march has a marvelous balance of technique and melody in a continuous flow of musical ideas. It dared to break the old formulas, however, because it has no introduction, no break strain, and no stinger. Curiously, long after Grafulla's death, during the presidential contest of 1896, while McKinley and Bryan were debating the burning issue of a silver vs. gold monetary standard, his publishers issued a Solid Money March under the palindrome, \"C.S.Allufarg\". Some of Grafulla's works, including \"Parade\" and \"Freischutz Quickstep\", were heard in the 1990 Ken Burns PBS miniseries, The Civil War.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"William A.

It is a huge, complex hill with many ridges, summits and corries, covering approximately 40 square kilometres with three Munros. These are Càrn Liath (Grey Cairn) at 976 metres, Bràigh Coire Chruinn-bhalgain (\"Brae/Brow of the Corrie of Round Blisters\", \"blisters\" referring to rock formations) at 1070 metres and Càrn nan Gabhar (\"Hill/cairn of the Goats\") at 1121.9 metres. The mountain has patches of grey scree (see pictures) amongst grass, while heather grows quite profusely on the lower slopes and gives the hill a colourful skirt when in bloom in Summer. Beinn a' Ghlò has such a diversity of flora that it has been declared a SSSI and a SAC over an area of 80 square kilometres. It is a region of European dry heaths and there are many species of alpine and marsh plants on the mountain such as the rare yellow oxytropis (Oxytropis campestris), mountain avens (Dryas octopetala), rock speedwell (Veronica fruticans), rock sedge (Carex rupestris) and green spleenwort (Asplenium viride). Beinn a’ Ghlò is a familiar sight to motorists travelling north along the A9 road at the Pass of Killiecrankie but this view only shows Càrn Liath. The main mass of the mountain is hidden behind with, the highest and most distant Munro, Càrn nan Gabhar more than 12 kilometres from Blair Atholl, so it is a full day's expedition to climb all three Munros. Beinn a’ Ghlò has nineteen corries and legend says that a rifle shot in any one cannot be heard in any of the others. Queen Victoria viewed the mountain in 1844 on a drive up Glen Tilt, saying, ''“We came upon a lovely view — Beinn a’ Ghlò straight before us — and under these high hills the River Tilt gushing and winding over stones and slates … and the air so pure and fine but no description can do it justice”. There are two popular starting points for the traverse of the mountain. The first is at Loch Moraig (grid reference ) at the end of the minor road, three kilometres from Blair Atholl. The other is at Marble Lodge in Glen Tilt (grid reference ) but this requires permission from the Atholl Estate to drive the seven Kilometres up the private estate road. From Loch Moraig a track is followed to the foot of the mountain. It is a steep climb to the first Munro of Càrn Liath passing through white granite scree near the top. The route continues north dropping down to a col at 760 metres to climb Bràigh Coire Chruinn-bhalgain which gives a fine view down into Glen Tilt before turning east to take in Càrn nan Gabhar. The return to Loch Moraig can be varied, going over the \"top\" of Airgiod Bheinn (1061 metres), which translates as Silver Mountain, before dropping into the valley and picking up the track; this avoids the need to re-ascend the first two Munros. Càrn Liath and Càrn nan Gabhar both have trig points and are excellent viewpoints. Càrn nan Gabhar’s highest point is not actually at the trig point, it is at a cairn 200 metres north east with a height of 1121.9 metres (about two metres more than the trig point). Càrn nan Gabhar has a panorama that includes the Cairngorms, the Glen Shee hills and an aerial view down into Glen Loch. Càrn Liath looks out over Blair Atholl towards the Scottish Lowlands.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Geotourism deals with the natural and built environments.

Part of the South Ward, it is separated from Clinton Hill by Hawthorne Avenue on the north, and bordered by the city of Irvington on the west, Newark Liberty International Airport and Dayton on the east, and Hillside Township and the city of Elizabeth on the south. The name \"Weequahic\" is Lenni-Lenape for \"head of the cove\". The area was farmland until the late nineteenth century when it was developed into a middle-class, non-industrial neighborhood of detached single-family homes oriented around Weequahic Park. Later many multi-unit homes were built to the west, and later still a few residential modernist highrises were built. Weequahic was largely a middle class Jewish neighborhood until the late 1960s, home to many synagogues, yeshivas, and Jewish restaurants. Newark Beth Israel Medical Center (in Weequahic), the largest hospital in Newark, was built under auspices of the Jewish community. Author Philip Roth grew up in Weequahic, graduated from Weequahic High School in 1950, and many of his novels (such as American Pastoral, Nemesis) are set there. Heart of Stone, a documentary by Beth Toni Kruvant, focuses on Weequahic High School's decline from 1950's when it graduated more PhDs than any other high school in the country, to one of Newark, NJ's most crime ridden schools. Principal Ron Stone wears a bulletproof vest and inspires the students, including gang members to graduate and go to college. He partners with the Jewish and African alumni association to help the current students. The only remaining connection to the Jewish community is Bragman's Delicatessen and Restaurant at 393 Hawthorne Avenue. The post-World War II growth of suburbs and Second Great Migration of African Americans altered the demographic make-up of Newark in general and the Weequahic section in particular. The neighborhood might have stayed middle class if not for the devastating effects of real estate blockbusting and the construction of Interstate 78. I-78 tore Weequahic's fragile urban fabric and separated the neighborhood from the rest of Newark. The 1967 Newark riots were also devastating to the district. The Weequahic district also experienced white flight, though the focal point of the riots was in the Central Ward. The jewel of the neighborhood is the 311 acre (1.3 km²) Olmsted Brothers-designed Weequahic Park. This lovely park has a 2.2-mile rubberized jogging path around its 80-acre (324,000 m²) lake, and the oldest public golf course in the United States. Part of the Weequahic neighborhood has been designated a historic district. The neighborhood's major streets are Lyons Avenue, Bergen Street, and Chancellor Avenue.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Runnymede is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada located north of Bloor Street West between Jane Street and Runnymede Road north to Dundas Street West.

The Knights were founded by Merton Bird, an African-American man, and W. Dorr Legg, his white lover. Sources differ as to the founding date of the organization, variously citing it as 1949, 1950, and 1951. Regardless of the exact date, the Knights was one of the earliest gay organizations in the United States, with only the Society for Human Rights (established 1924), the Veterans Benevolent Association (established 1945) and possibly the Mattachine Society (established 1950) pre-dating it.The Knights were primarily a social club, including people of both sexes and family members of couples. They also tried to address social problems that affected interracial couples, including employment counseling and locating integrated housing for same-sex couples. To that end, the Knights discussed the possibility of establishing communes throughout its existence, although no such communes were ever established. Although social functions routinely attracted as many as 200 participants, at its core the Knights always remained a numerically small group and eventually disbanded in the mid-1950s. Several Knights, including Bird and Legg, went on to join ONE, Inc., another early homophile organization. Sociologist Laud Humphreys cited the Knights as an example of the ability of people of different races to cross racial barriers through commonality of sexual identification.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Gastank was an English television show that aired between 1982–1983 in the United Kingdom on Channel 4.

Chorlton Park is another ward in the same area. This ward had a separate population at the same census of 15,147. By the 9th century, there was an Anglo-Saxon settlement here. Later in the Middle Ages, improved drainage methods led to population growth. In the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, its perceived rural character made it popular among the middle class. The loss of its railway station, the conversion of larger houses into flats or bedsitters, and significant social housing development to the south of the area changed its character again in the 1970s. Historically, Chorlton was a village on Lancashire's southern border with Cheshire, and a township within the ancient parish of Manchester. It was incorporated into the city of Manchester in 1904. Chorlton borders Stretford, Sale, Didsbury, Withington, and Whalley Range. The River Mersey runs past Chorlton along its southern boundary.

The Trigonalidae are divided into two subfamilies, Orthogonalinae and Trigonalinae. These wasps are extremely rare, but surprisingly diverse, with some 90 species in over 15 genera, and are known from all parts of the world. What little is known about the biology of these insects indicates a remarkably improbable life history: in nearly all known species, females lay thousands of minute eggs, \"clamping\" them to the edges of, or injecting them inside leaves. The egg must then be consumed by a caterpillar. Once inside the caterpillar, the trigonalid egg either hatches and attacks any other parasitoid larvae (including its siblings) in the caterpillar, or it waits until the caterpillar is killed and fed to a vespid larva, which it then attacks. If the caterpillar is neither attacked by another parasitoid or fed to a vespid, the trigonalid larva fails to develop. Therefore, they are parasitoids or hyperparasitoids, but in a manner virtually unique among the insects, in that the eggs must be swallowed by a host. A few species are known exceptions, which directly parasitise sawflies.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Vrouwenakker is a village in the Netherlands, about 12 km southeast of Hoofddorp.

It was discovered in 2013 from the mosquito Coquillettidia xanthogaster. The female mosquitoes were originally collected in 2010 from Darwin, Katherine, Alice Springs, Alyangula, Groote Eylandt, Jabiru and the McArthur River Mine, and had since been preserved. The discovery was made by biologists at the University of Queensland. The virus is named after Palm Creek, near Darwin, from where it was originally isolated. PCV is the first insect-specific virus discovered in Australia. Genetically it most closely related to Nakiwogo virus, isolated from Mansonia mosquito in Uganda, and clustered more broadly with Culex-associated viruses, such as Culex flavivirus (CxFV).In one experiment in 2016, when cultivated mosquito [Aedes albopictus (C6/36)] cells were preinfected with PCV, human-pathogenic viruses such as West Nile and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses were found to be unable to develop in the infected cells. The follow-up experiment confirmed the fact that pre-infection of mosquitoes prevents transmission of harmful arbovirus. Further, it shown that PCV could not infect Culex annulirostris, the primary vector of encephalitic flaviviruses in Australian, through blood meal indicating that the virus is not a threat to human, or other vertebrate, health. However, the virus could be inoculated (at the thorax region) with successful infection in the ''C. annulirostris, Aedes aegypti and A. vigilax''. This further supports the fact that preinfection of these disease-vector mosquitoes with PCV can be prevented from transmitting harmful viral diseases in humans, since a mosquito generally do not carry mixed infection. The PCV genome encodes a polyprotein that consists of 3,364 amino acids. Genetic analysis shows that it is most closely related African virus Nakiwogo virus (NAKV), sharing 63.7% nucleotide similarity. A report indicates that the virus is also closely related to Assam virus, discovered in Assam, India, in 2015.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Birgitte Cathrine Boye (March 7, 1742 – October 17, 1824) was a Danish hymnwriter.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"\"James\" Tang Chi Lun (born 15 July 1975) is a Hong Kong racing driver currently competing in the TCR International Series.

Academic freedom is a contested issue and, therefore, has limitations in practice. In the United States, for example, according to the widely recognized \"1940 Statement on Academic Freedom and Tenure\" of the American Association of University Professors, teachers should be careful to avoid controversial matter that is unrelated to the subject. When they speak or write in public, they are free to express their opinions without fear from institutional censorship or discipline, but they should show restraint and clearly indicate that they are not speaking for their institution. Academic tenure protects academic freedom by ensuring that teachers can be fired only for causes such as gross professional incompetence or behavior that evokes condemnation from the academic community itself.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The High Flux Isotope Reactor (or HFIR) is a nuclear research reactor located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, United States. Operating at 85 MW, HFIR is one of the highest flux reactor-based sources of neutrons for condensed matter research in the United States, and it provides one of the highest steady-state neutron fluxes of any research reactor in the world. The thermal and cold neutrons produced by HFIR are used to study physics, chemistry, materials science, engineering, and biology. The intense neutron flux, constant power density, and constant-length fuel cycles are used by more than 500 researchers each year for neutron scattering research into the fundamental properties of condensed matter. HFIR has approximately 600 users each year for both scattering and in-core research. The neutron scattering research facilities at HFIR contain a world-class collection of instruments used for fundamental and applied research on the structure and dynamics of matter. The reactor is also used for medical, industrial, and research isotope production; research on severe neutron damage to materials; and neutron activation to examine trace elements in the environment. Additionally, the building houses a gamma irradiation facility that uses spent fuel assemblies and is capable of accommodating high gamma dose experiments. With projected regular operations, the next major shutdown for a beryllium reflector replacement will not be necessary until approximately 2023. This outage provides an opportunity to install a cold source in radial beam tube HB-2, which would provide an unparalleled flux of cold neutrons feeding instruments in a new guide hall. With or without this additional capability, HFIR is projected to continue operating through 2040 and beyond. In November 2007 ORNL officials announced that time-of-flight tests on a newly installed cold source (which uses liquid helium and hydrogen to slow the movement of neutrons) showed better performance than design predictions, equaling or surpassing the previous world record set by the research reactor at the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble, France.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The National Academy of Performing Arts (, abbreviated as NAPA) is an performing arts school located at Hindu Gymkhana in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan.

This provides detailed mapping of drug effects on metabolism and the pathways that are implicated in mechanism of variation of response to treatment. In addition, the metabolic profile of an individual at baseline (metabotype) provides information about how individuals respond to treatment and highlights heterogeneity within a disease state.

The ability to perceive emotion is believed to be both innate and subject to environmental influence and is also a critical component in social interactions. How emotion is experienced and interpreted depends on how it is perceived. Likewise, how emotion is perceived is dependent on past experiences and interpretations.

It was debuted as the first of the new-model Fender amps of the 1960s, with new tolex-covered cabinets and front-mounted control panels that would replace the tweed-covered, top-panel cabinets that were prevalent during the 1950s, as well as new circuitry which would characterize most Fender amplifiers for two decades. The Vibrasonic was introduced in 1959 and was discontinued in 1964. During this period, the \"brownface\" era, its brown control panel was matched with light brown (\"tan\") or standard brown tolex cabinets with grill cloth schemes typically in tweed style (\"gold stripe\") or yellow (\"wheat\"). At the time of its introduction, the Vibrasonic-Amp displaced the Fender Twin as the company's new top of the line or \"flagship\" model. This elevated status was short-lived however, as the new high-powered 6G8 blonde Twin-Amp appeared in mid 1960. The Vibrasonic was one of the seven models in the newly designated Professional Series of Fender amplifiers. These amplifiers shared nearly identical circuits, with two (or four) 5881/6L6GC tubes in fixed-bias Class AB configuration, long-tailed pair phase inverters, and dual \"normal\" and \"vibrato\" channels with independent volume and tone controls; the models were differentiated only by cabinet/speaker configurations, transformers, and rectifiers. The tremolo (\"vibrato\") circuit which the Vibrasonic premiered and which gave it its name more closely resembled a Vox tremolo circuit than anything which Fender used before or after, a complex \"harmonic vibrato\" which created the illusion of true pitch-shifting. Two tubes (5G13 model) and later three tubes (6G13-A model) were used in the tremolo circuit alone and this perhaps explains why it was not widely used, and abandoned in the mid-1960s \"blackface\" amps. The 1×15 Vibrasonic, like the 4×10 Concert-Amp, featured a larger interleaved output transformer designed to minimize distortion and maximize clean headroom in the output stage. Unlike the Concert-Amp however, the Vibrasonic-Amp was the first production Fender amplifier to use a speaker made by the James B. Lansing company. JBL speakers were considered superior to the usual Jensen speakers in terms of their power handling capacity and frequency response. Only the prototypes of this amp were built with metal control knobs, as pictured in the 1960 Fender Musical Instruments catalog.

Syriac Christians advocate different terms for ethnic self-designation. Syriac Christians from the Middle East are theologically and culturally closely related to, but should not be confused with the Saint Thomas Christians from India, whose ties to Syriac Christians were a result of trade links and migration by Assyrian Christians from Mesopotamia and the Middle East mostly around the 9th century. Historically, the three ethnic names used to describe those who would become Syriac Christians were extant before the advent of Christianity: Assyrian, referring to the land and people of Assyria in northern Mesopotamia, Aramean, referring to the people of Aram in The Levant and Syrian/Syriac, originally being used specifically as an Indo-European corruption of Assyrian, but from the late 4th century BC, being applied by the Seleucid Greeks to the Arameans of The Levant. Other purely doctrinal and theological terms such as \"Syriac Christian\", \"Chaldean\", \"Jacobite\" and \"Nestorian\", appeared much later, usually as labels imposed by theologians from Europe. The problem became more acute in 1946, when with the creation and independence of Syria, the adjective \"Syrian\" came to refer to that Arab-majority independent state, where Syriac Christians formed a minority.

Mengmei was a descendant to the reputed poet Liu Zongyuan, Prefect of Liuzhou during the Tang Dynasty period, and would be born into a family branch present within the District of Longnan. His father respectively held the title of Doctor-at-Large; his mother: Lady of the County. Having been orphaned at an early age and taken into the care of a gardener by the name of Camelback Guo, Mengmei rose from his place of residence by mid-adulthood, resolved to reach the capital prefecture of Guangzhou and complete the secondary examinations for political office. Two weeks prior to this resolution he experienced a dream in which had been present a woman of beautiful appearance standing beneath a flowering plum; this woman informed him that it is a credential for her to reach his side in love if his political aspirations are to be guaranteed with ultimate success. Subsequently, Mengmei chose to head to the Terrace of Prince Zhao Tao to see his friend Han Zicai, descendant of Han Yu, for the sake of discussing the course of his pilgrimage. After having confronted his old friend Han Zicai, Mengmei learned that a man by the name of Secretary Miao, Imperial Commissioner for the Examination of Gems, was sympathetic in nature and a recipient of high rank, thus making him a more suitable patron than his initial caretaker Guo. Knowing that Miao would first assess gems in the Temple of the Many-jewelled in Guangzhou's Vale of Incense Mountains, and his tour of duty would meet its conclusion by the end of autumn, Mengmei accordingly reassured his friend that he would head to such a region with immediate pace. Upon returning to his estate he pondered for a time about the course that should be taken in retrospect to the dream he considered prophetical and the paramount suggestion presented by his old friend Han Zicai. After having confronted Camel Guo with the resolution to set out on his journey, Guo consented and packed whatever clothing that he deemed would be a necessity for Mengmei upon reaching the examination halls of Guangzhou, promising in return that he will watch for his \"return in brocaded gown\".","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Darnton is an English surname. Therefore, the most likely origins are either (1) related to some place (2) related to some occupation (3) perhaps indicative of some relationship. The word, and its components, Darn - ton, indicate that (2) and (3) are unlikely. Therefore, most ancestors are likely to come from the same place. The -ton at the end is one of the most common endings in English place names. Its meaning can be such as town, village, hamlet, farmstead, enclosure, fence or hedge. Several writers suggest this has become an enclosed village or farmstead. One writer suggests that where the prefix to -ton is a name, the -ton is more likely to refer to an enclosed farmstead. Darn- is more difficult, and most sources seem to favour it being an abbreviation of some kind. An analysis of key life events shows that most have occurred in North England, with South County Durham and North Yorkshire having the highest frequencies. The place with the largest number of life events we can trace since 1450 is Staindrop in South County Durham. Therefore, the answer probably lies there. Dar(li)n(g)ton Darnton may be an abbreviation of Darlington. This is the explicit explanation given in Longstaffe's History of Darlington (2nd edition, 1909). \"In the earliest records, however, the name [Darlington] occurs as Dearnington, Dernington, Derningtune, forms correctly contracted in Darnton and Dernton.\" p3.At pp 5–6, Longstaffe gives several references to specific people with the name Darnton. According to Ekwall (4th ed., 1960) Darlington is 'The Tun of Deornop's people'. Dar(ri)n(g)ton Barber (British Family Names, 894) refers Darnton to Darrington in North Yorkshire (near Pontefract). Ekwall has Darrington as 'The Tun of Dægheard's people', with a Domesday Book reference to the name Darni(n)tone. Johnson has Darrington as 'Town, village, of Deorna'. J. Horsfall Turner (Yorkshire Place Names or toponomy as recorded in the Yorkshire Domesday Book 1086:...) published in Bingley date unknown but in the range 1888-1920 in discussing etymology has 'Darn' as a Celtic derivative for water or river, Dearne as bright water, swift, and he indicates Darnin and Darni as original owners. (pp254–5) Darnton Rebus John Darnton, 30th Abbot of Fountains Abbey, was responsible for much work including the West Window. Over that window is a stone corbel carved as a rebus (a representation of a name by pictures or figures) for John Darnton. This Darnton Rebus is now very badly corroded, probably through pollution, but it was distinct early this century. The construction and interpretation of this rebus is that the bird is a \"Dern' and the barrel held by the bird is a 'ton'.

Outside spending is defined as any independent expenditure by a non-party group to benefit a candidate. The People’s Pledge was developed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Scott Brown during the 2012 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts. The candidates publicly called on outside groups to stop spending in support of either candidate. They then agreed to pay a penalty equal to half the amount of any outside expenditure from their campaign account to a charity of the opponent’s choice. In the 2012 U.S Senate election in Massachusetts, the Pledge significantly reduced outside spending. People’s Pledges have been implemented in 2014 primary elections and proposed in numerous federal races.

A common form, , is a retort to an irrelevant suggestion. This facetious usage implies that the topic under discussion might as well be the price of tea in China for all the relevance the speaker's suggestion bears on it. It has been said that this expression has stemmed from economists, who describe everything economic as affecting everything else, trying to find an expression which denotes the farthest logical connection from their current economic focus, in a sort of butterfly effect. In this way, the price of tea in China was used to denote the farthest possibility. It can also be used to denote an irrelevant topic. Another explanation of the phrase's origin is that in the 19th century the price for tea in England was the highest when the first ship with the newly harvested tea from the tightly controlled Chinese markets came in. So for the ship owners it was important to be as fast as possible back to England with the load, otherwise the cost of the passage might not be recovered from the sale of the tea. Thus there were real races (the tea clipper races) where the sail ships managed to travel the whole distance from China to England in about 80 to 90 days. The difference in prices from the first load to the later ones was so high that the original price which was paid for the tea in China was quite unimportant. So the \"price of tea in China\" was something that really didn't matter for the ship owners. They had to have the tea in England as fast as possible. A related expression in Hebrew can be found in a commentary on the Biblical commandment of the septennial sabbatical year. Leviticus 25:1 specifically states that God spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai; while this was a common location for God to speak to Moses, the text's explicit reference to it is very rare. Accordingly, Rashi's commentary begins with the question \"What is the connection between Shmita and Mount Sinai?\" (?מה עניין שמיטה אצל הר סיני) The question has since taken on a general meaning equivalent to that of the \"price of tea in China\" expression.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Frank Miller may refer to:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Hocine Aït Ahmed (&lrm;; 20 August 1926 &ndash; 23 December 2015) was an Algerian politician.

The event is used as an early season preparatory event by many of the top teams in readiness for the bigger races later in the season. The five races are ranked 1.1 on the UCI Europe Tour. Although the race styles itself as the \"Tour of Majorca\" it has never been allowed to be classed as a multi day stage race by the sports governing body the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) because the race rules allows riders not to participate on certain days if they don’t want to. However, there is an unofficial overall classification winner taken on total time over five days. This laid back attitude by the race organisers makes the race popular with team managers who can bring a large squad (sometimes as many as 20 riders) and interchange them over the five days. Apart from the overall classification on time there are the usual Mountains, Points and Sprints competitions associated with any stage race. There is also a competition for the top Majorcan based rider, in the past this has been won by Vicente Reynès, Antonio Colóm and Antonio Tauler. The first day of racing is the Trofeo Mallorca which is a criterium (circuit race) around the streets of Palma. The second day is the Trofeo Cala Millor, sometimes called the Trofeo Alcúdia. These two opening days are run over a fairly flat course and result in a sprint finish. The Trofeo Pollença (day three) and Trofeo Sóller (day four) are contested over a more hilly course using the climbs of the Col de Sóller (501 metres) and the Col de Puig Major (850 metres) amongst others on the route. These two hilly days usually decide the outcome of the unofficial overall classification over the five days. The final days racing is the Trofeo Calvià which takes place on an undulating course over a series of small climbs. Top class riders such as Laurent Jalabert, Alex Zülle and Alejandro Valverde have won the overall classification at the Vuelta a Mallorca; however, Spanish rider Francesco Cabello who rode for the Kelme team throughout his career, holds the record for the most victories, taking three overall victories in Majorca in 1996, 2000 and 2002. In 2004 Colóm became the first rider who was a native of the island of Majorca to take the overall classification.

Its capital was Rodez. At its height, it was a centre of troubadour culture. On the death of Hugh of Rouergue in 1053, Bertha, his heiress, disputed the Rouergue with William IV of Toulouse and Raymond of Saint-Gilles, distant relations. A decade of war ensued, but Bertha died in 1065 and William and Raymond took to fighting each other for the Rouergue. Since William was already count of Toulouse an agreement was reached whereby Raymond was recognised in the Rouerge. When Raymond succeeded William in 1094, Rouergue became an appanage for the younger sons of the counts of Toulouse. When Raymond left on the First Crusade at the end of October 1096, however, he left Richard III of Millau, a younger son of Viscount Berengar of Millau and Rodez, in charge of the citadel of Rodez and several castles. Taking advantage of the war between Raymond's successor, Alfonso Jordan, and William IX of Aquitaine, Richard made himself count in 1112. Rodez remained with the house of Millau until 1304, when it passed to Bernard VI of Armagnac, husband of Cecilia, heiress of the last Millau count, Henry II.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The pulp of the spleen is practically all splenic tissue from one trabecular artery to another.

This is compared with the \"hot\" fusion which takes place naturally within stars, under immense pressure and at temperatures of millions of degrees, and distinguished from muon-catalyzed fusion. There is currently no accepted theoretical model that would allow cold fusion to occur. In 1989 Martin Fleischmann (then one of the world's leading electrochemists) and Stanley Pons reported that their apparatus had produced anomalous heat (\"excess heat\") of a magnitude they asserted would defy explanation except in terms of nuclear processes. They further reported measuring small amounts of nuclear reaction byproducts, including neutrons and tritium. The small tabletop experiment involved electrolysis of heavy water on the surface of a palladium (Pd) electrode. The reported results received wide media attention, and raised hopes of a cheap and abundant source of energy. Many scientists tried to replicate the experiment with the few details available. Hopes faded due to the large number of negative replications, the withdrawal of many reported positive replications, the discovery of flaws and sources of experimental error in the original experiment, and finally the discovery that Fleischmann and Pons had not actually detected nuclear reaction byproducts. By late 1989, most scientists considered cold fusion claims dead, and cold fusion subsequently gained a reputation as pathological science. In 1989 the United States Department of Energy (DOE) concluded that the reported results of excess heat did not present convincing evidence of a useful source of energy and decided against allocating funding specifically for cold fusion. A second DOE review in 2004, which looked at new research, reached similar conclusions and did not result in DOE funding of cold fusion. A small community of researchers continues to investigate cold fusion, now often preferring the designation low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR) or condensed matter nuclear science (CMNS). Since cold fusion articles are rarely published in peer-reviewed mainstream scientific journals, they do not attract the level of scrutiny expected for mainstream scientific publications.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Health Board system of Ireland was created by the 1970 Health Act.
