Standing at only 5'8\", Tompkins is just one of many diminutive kick return specialists to have found success in the CFL. After attending Stephen F. Austin University, Tompkins signed with the Edmonton Eskimos as the replacement for former kick returner Winston October. As a rookie in 2005, Tompkins participated in the 93rd Grey Cup in Vancouver, where he set a record for the longest kickoff return in a Grey Cup game by taking the ball 96 yards for a key touchdown, helping the Eskimos take victory.After the Grey Cup, Tompkins believed that he was entering his option year, and as such that he would have a chance to try and sign with a National Football League team. Tompkins, who did not have an agent when he signed his first contract, in fact signed a two-year contract with a club option, thus requiring him to report to the Eskimos for one more season than he expected. Tompkins's agent Alex Balic attempted to persuade the Eskimos to release Tompkins but they refused. Tompkins and Balic briefly considered legal action, but in the end Tompkins agreed to return to the Eskimos for the 2006 CFL season. Tompkins made $40,000 CAD with the Eskimos in 2006, well below the NFL league minimum and returned 75 punts for 501 yards, 57 kickoffs for 1,145 yards, and ten missed field goal returns for 209 yards, finishing with the Eskimos’ most all-purpose yards with 1,855. In the 2007 CFL season, Tompkins led the Eskimos in punt return yardage, kickoff returns, and missed field goal return yards and finished the year second on the team in all-purpose yards. In February 2008, Tompkins signed as a free-agent with the Alouettes.

He is also known as Muyalaka or Muyalakan. In order to preserve knowledge in the world, Apasmāra could not be killed; to do so would throw out the balance of knowledge and ignorance, as to kill Apasmāra would mean attaining knowledge without effort, dedication and hard work. Consequently, this would lead to the devaluing of knowledge in all forms. In order to subdue Apasmāra, Lord Śiva adopted the form of Śrī Naṭarāja - the Lord of Dance and performed the cosmic dance of Tāṇḍava. During this dance, Śrī Naṭarāja suppressed Apasmāra by crushing him with his right foot. As Apasmāra is one of the few demons destined to immortality, it is believed that Lord Śiva forever remains in his Śrī Naṭarāja form suppressing Apasmāra for all eternity. This mythological dwarf is generally depicted with his hand in Añjali Mudrā. He is often depicted in this posture in depictions of Naṭarāja.

However, the process of permanent Jewish settlement in Estonia began in the 19th century, especially after they were granted the official right to enter the region by a statute of Russian Tsar Alexander II in 1865. This allowed the so-called Jewish \"Nicholas soldiers\" (often former cantonists) and their descendants, First Guild merchants, artisans, and Jews with higher education to settle in Estonia and other parts of the Russian Empire outside their Pale of Settlement. The \"Nicholas soldiers\" and their descendants, and artisans were, basically, the ones who founded the first Jewish congregations in Estonia. The Tallinn congregation, the largest in Estonia, was founded in 1830. The Tartu congregation was established in 1866 when the first fifty families settled there. Synagogues were built, the largest of which were constructed in Tallinn in 1883 and Tartu in 1901. Both of these were subsequently destroyed by fire in World War II. The Jewish population spread to other Estonian cities where houses of prayer (at Valga, Pärnu and Viljandi) were erected and cemeteries were established. Schools were opened to teach Talmud, and elementary schools were organised in Tallinn in the 1880s. The majority of the Jewish population at that time consisted of small tradesmen and artisans; very few knew science, hence Jewish cultural life lagged. This began to change at the end of the 19th century when several Jews entered the University of Tartu and later contributed significantly to enliven Jewish culture and education. 1917 even saw the founding of the Jewish Drama Club in Tartu.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Super C is a Quebec discount supermarket chain with more than 80 stores in Quebec.

In contrast to this top-down approach, there is the bottom-up approach of direct perception. Also known as intelligent perception, constructive perception shows the relationship between intelligence and perception. This comes from the importance of high-order thinking and learning in perception. During perception, hypotheses are formed and tested about percepts that are based on three things: sensory data, knowledge, and high-level cognitive processes. Visual sensations are usually correctly attributed because we unconsciously assimilate information from many sources and then unconsciously make judgments based on this information. The philosophy of Immanuel Kant explains that our perception of the world is reciprocal; it both is affected by and affects our experience of the world.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Marinkova Bara () is an urban neighborhood of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia.

He established many championship records, including career appearances (65), scoring tally (33-208) and number of All-Ireland medals won (8), however, these records were subsequently bested by Brendan Cummins, Eddie Keher and Henry Shefflin respectively. Ring is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers in the history of the game, with many former players, commentators and fans rating him as the number one player of all time. Born in Cloyne, County Cork, Ring first played competitive hurling following encouragement from his local national school teachers Michael O'Brien and Jerry Moynihan. He first appeared on the Cloyne minor team at the age of twelve before later winning a county minor championship medal with the nearby St. Enda's team. A county junior championship medal with Cloyne followed, however, a dispute with club officials saw Ring join Glen Rovers in Blackpool in 1941. Over the next twenty-six years with the club, Ring won one Munster medal and fourteen county senior championship medals. As a Gaelic footballer with the Glen's sister club, St. Nicholas', he also won a county senior championship medal. He retired from club hurling at the age of forty-six following a victory over University College Cork in the 1967 championship quarter-final. Over the course of his senior championship career Ring estimated that he played in 1,200 games. Ring made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he was picked on the Cork minor panel for the All-Ireland final. In spite of victory, he was denied an All-Ireland medal as he was Cork's last non-playing substitute. Still eligible for the grade in 1938, Ring collected a set of All-Ireland and Munster medals as a member of the starting fifteen. An unsuccessful year with the Cork junior hurlers followed before he made his senior debut during the 1939-40 league. Over the course of the next quarter of a century, Ring won eight All-Ireland medals, including a record four championships in-a-row from 1941 to 1944, a lone triumph in 1946 and three championships in-a-row from 1952 to 1954. The only player to lift the Liam MacCarthy Cup three times as captain, he was denied a record-breaking ninth All-Ireland medal in 1956 in what was his last All-Ireland final appearance. Ring also won nine Munster medals, four National Hurling League medals and was named Hurler of the Year at the age of thirty-eight. He played his last game for Cork in June 1963. After indicating his willingness to line out for the team once again in 1964, Ring failed to be selected for the Cork team, a move which effectively brought his inter-county career to an end. After being chosen as a substitute on the Munster inter-provincial team in 1941, Ring was an automatic choice on the starting fifteen for the following twenty-two years. He scored 42-105 as he won a record eighteen Railway Cup medals during that period, in an era when his skill and prowess drew crowds of up to 50,000 to Croke Park for the annual final on St. Patrick's Day. Ring's retirement from the game is often cited as a contributory factor in the decline of the championship. In retirement from playing Ring became involved in team management and coaching. As a mentor to the St. Finbarr's College senior team, he guided them to their first two All-Ireland and Harty Cup triumphs in 1963 and 1969. At club level Ring was instrumental as a selector with Glen Rovers when they claimed their inaugural All-Ireland title in 1973, having earlier annexed the Munster and county senior championship titles. It was with the Cork senior team that he enjoyed his greatest successes as a selector. After an unsuccessful campaign in his first season on the selection panel in 1973, Ring was dropped the following year before being reinstated in 1975. Over the next three years Cork claimed three successive All-Ireland titles. Ring was most famous for his scoring prowess, physical strength and career longevity. He remains the only player to have competed at inter-county level in four different decades. Often the target of public attention for his hurling exploits, in private Ring was a shy and reserved individual. A teetotaller and non-smoker throughout his life, he was also a devout Roman Catholic. Ring's sudden death in March 1979 and the scenes which followed at his funeral were unprecedented in Cork since the death of the martyred Lord Mayor Tomás Mac Curtain in 1920. He was posthumously honoured by being named on the Hurling Team of the Century in 1984 and the Hurling Team of the Millennium in 2000, while he was also named as the Century's Best Hurler in the Irish Times.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"William Waldorf Astor II, 3rd Viscount Astor (13 August 1907 – 7 March 1966) was an English businessman and Conservative Party politician.

The syndrome is relatively harmless, though it can be irritating, and healthy individuals can express symptoms. Stimuli range from a firm pressure applied to the skin – a scratch – to irritation or pulling on a hair follicle on the skin. The referred sensation itself should not be painful; it is more of an irritating prickle leading to the compulsion to scratch the area. The stimulus and referred itch are ipsilateral (the stimulus and the referred itch occur on the same side of the body). Also, because scratching or putting pressure on the referred itch does not cause the stimulus area to itch, the relationship between the stimulus and the referred itch is unidirectional. The itching sensation is spontaneous and can cease with continued stimulation. There are two types of referred itch: normal and acquired (pathological). Normal mitempfindung is usually detected in early childhood and persists for the majority, if not the rest, of the individual’s life. Acquired or pathological mitempfindung is the effect of damage to the central nervous system and only lasts for a short period of time. Symptoms are variable among affected individuals, but it is widely accepted that the soles of the feet, palms, and the face are never affected by mitempfindung. There is no evidence of genetic influence on referred itch. There is a published study, however, that mentions an affected man whose children were also affected. Much is still unknown about the physiological mechanisms of the phenomenon, and no single theory is accepted. Research and information regarding mitempfindung is limited and dated. Most research on the topic was conducted in the late 19th century, and the most recent publications occurred in the late 1970s. A handful of studies were done in the early 1990s, but further data must be collected and interpreted before a thorough understanding of mitempfindung is reached.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Štrba is a village in the Poprad District, Prešov Region, northern Slovakia.

After completing his secondary education he studied literature in Zaragoza for a while and then moved to Paris to study ancient Greek history at the École des hautes études en sciences sociales. Jesús Ferrero, like Javier Marías or Antonio Muñoz Molina, is a writer of that new Spanish prose which developed after La Movida Madrileña (Madriliene Movement), one of the early post-modern currents. He has written numerous novels, poetry collections, short stories, essays and screenplays. He is, among other things, co-author of Pedro Almodóvar's film Matador. Ferrero's debut, Chinese-set novel 'Belver Yin' (1981) was one of the most successful and critically acclaimed in post-Franco Spanish literature, and helped him to establish himself as one of the major writers of La Movida years. With novels set in Tibet ('Opium', 1986), Barcelona ('Lady Pepa', 1988) or Berlin ('Débora Blenn', 1988), Ferrero continued during the eighties a literary exploration characterized by eclectic intertextuality. Fererro’s book 'El Efecto Doppler' (1990), follows a precise choreography which shows the protagonist, Darío, caught up in a complex tale. During an evening meal in Paris the young Rosaura blows her brains out in front of the diners: \"Suddenly she looked at me and took a pistol from her bag. Without stopping her whistling she put the weapon to her temple.\" Every gesture, every look follows a kind of message, and Darío, Rosaura’s cousin, takes it upon himself to create a meaningful entity from the seemingly unconnected clues. In calm, very precise language and in a very detailed, cleverly devised structure Ferrero tells in his novel a gripping love story and at the same time makes us consider the limits of our perception. Precise, too, is that view which the hero has in the novel 'El diablo en los ojos' (1998). Since young Leo Salgado has been focussing his camera lens on his own family, he senses the great influence of this instrument which is able to record everyday trivialities and their most intimate facets. The camera here is the up-and-coming creative genius which captures, with almost cruel clarity, the disintegration of the family. The action of Jesús Ferrero’s novel, 'Juanelo o el hombre nuevo' (2000), is set in Toledo in the 16th century. The protagonist in this fantasy-tale, a good-looking youth, gradually comes to discover the terrible history of his origin as he becomes more and more involved in events in Toledo. It becomes clear that he is an artificially created human being, a golem, a new kind of human being. The novel is a good example which again makes clear Ferrero’s basic themes: \"Destruction begins with the first tears in the cradle and ends when, in our parchment-like hands, time dies.\" Jesús Ferrero’s writing shows a rebirth of the old myths and also tells of the banal, sometimes absurd everyday stories. It reflects the utopias of the twentieth century like those of 'Metropolis'. Ferrero’s style has been seen as close to that of Cervantes or Kafka. The author loves adopting classical narrative patterns while also modernizing and using them aesthetically with new stylistic features. Since 1995 he has been living in Madrid where he teaches literature.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Grey Ghost Press was founded in 1994 by Ann Dupuis after spending time working on the Fudge RPG system by Steffan O'Sullivan.

Growth accounting decomposes the growth rate of an economy's total output into that which is due to increases in the contributing amount of the factors used—usually the increase in the amount of capital and labor—and that which cannot be accounted for by observable changes in factor utilization. The unexplained part of growth in GDP is then taken to represent increases in productivity (getting more output with the same amounts of inputs) or a measure of broadly defined technological progress. The technique has been applied to virtually every economy in the world and a common finding is that observed levels of economic growth cannot be explained simply by changes in the stock of capital in the economy or population and labor force growth rates. Hence, technological progress plays a key role in the economic growth of nations, or the lack of it.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Valley is a city in Chambers County, Alabama, United States.

He was the second son of a farmer, and began his science writing after suffering a heart attack at a young age. He admired the writing of Olaf Stapledon, author of influential works of science fiction and was happy to receive positive comment from Stapledon on his novel Tomorrow Sometimes Comes. As a writer, he might be best known for his series, Magnus Mensis, which was published in New Worlds from 1950 to 1961. Rayer was largely associated with the John Carnell era of New Worlds science fiction magazine. Rayer sometimes published under the pseudonyms of Chester Delray and George Longdon. When the UK Science Fiction Book Club was formed in 1953, Rayer's book \"Tomorrow Sometimes Comes\" was the fourth book issued by the club. His work was largely criticized by New Wave science fiction writers. From about 1960, he specialized in nonfiction and when Michael Moorcock became editor of New Worlds Rayer largely switched to nonfiction writing. Rayer's fiction has since mostly fallen out of popularity. As a technical journalist, he specialized in radio and electronics and designed electronic equipment. Rayer wrote many articles for the British magazine Practical Wireless. He held an amateur radio licence ( G3OGR ), and wrote technical books and numerous articles under the name F.G. Rayer. Rayer often provided illustrations and diagrams for these. He also wrote as Roland Worcester. Rayer was able to buy a cottage from his writing, married a teacher named Elizabeth, and had two children. He also learned Esperanto.

The 171 km² seat stretches from Hallett Cove and O'Halloran Hill in the north to Sellicks Beach in the south, including the suburbs of Aldinga Beach, Christie Downs, Christies Beach, Hackham, Hallett Cove, Huntfield Heights, Lonsdale, Maslin Beach, Moana, Morphett Vale, Old Noarlunga, Onkaparinga Hills, Port Noarlunga, Reynella, Seaford, Sellicks Beach, Sheidow Park, Port Willunga, Trott Park, Woodcroft, and parts of Happy Valley and McLaren Flat. The division was named after Charles Kingston, Premier of South Australia (1893–1899), elected to the first House of Representatives in 1901 and the first Federal member of the Division of Adelaide in 1903. Kingston was first based on the Holdfast Bay area to the north of the current boundaries from the 1949 election as a notionally marginal to fairly safe Labor seat. However, it fell to the Liberals in that election, only to have Labor win it at the 1951 election. This started a tradition of Labor and the Liberals alternating for long spells in a seat that has slowly moved south over the decades. It has now moved almost clear of its original boundaries; Hallett Cove is the only suburb within the seat's current borders that was part of the seat in 1949. It has tended to elect an MP from the governing party of the day, having elected only four opposition MPs. Notably, every sitting member in the electorate's history has been defeated at the polls—none have retired or resigned. Kingston has been represented by Labor MP Amanda Rishworth since the 2007 election where she won with a 54.4 percent two-party vote from a 4.5 percent swing. Going into the 2010 election, it was the most marginal Labor seat in South Australia. However, Rishworth consolidated her hold on the seat in 2010 by winning a 64 percent two-party vote from a 9.5 percent swing. At the 2013 election, Rishworth suffered a 4.9 percent swing to finish on a 59.7 percent two-party vote, but was still the second largest vote of any party in Kingston's history. In 2016, Rishworth further strengthened her hold on Kingston by boosting her majority to 67.1 percent on a swing of 7.7 percent, the strongest result in the seat's history. It is now Labor's second-safest seat in South Australia, behind only Port Adelaide, on two-party terms, however on the primary vote Kingston polled one percent higher at over 49 percent, the highest primary vote of South Australia's 11 seats. Though Labor picked up a two-party swing in all eleven seats, the presence of Nick Xenophon Team candidates in all eleven seats produced, apart from a suppressed major party primary vote, a result where Rishworth was the only major party candidate in the state to pick up a primary vote swing.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Adenophora is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae, the bellflowers.

Since the early 1900s, the term Sørlandet (\"south country\") has been more commonly used. Prior to that time, the area was considered a part of Western Norway. The area was a medieval petty kingdom, and after the unification of Norway, the area became known as Egdafylki and later yet called Agdesiden, a county within the kingdom of Norway. The name was not used after 1662 when the area was split into smaller governmental units called Nedenæs, Råbyggelaget, Lister, and Mandal. The name was resurrected in 1919 when two counties of Norway that roughly corresponded to the old Agdesiden county were renamed as Aust-Agder (East-Agder) and Vest-Agder (West-Agder). Today, the University of Agder has campuses in both Aust-Agder and Vest-Agder. The name also lives on in many other institutions such as the Diocese of Agder og Telemark, the Agder Court of Appeal, and the Agder Police District.

The District's population reached a peak of 802,178 in 1950. Shortly thereafter, the city began losing residents, and by 1980 Washington had lost one-quarter of its population. The population loss to the suburbs also created a new demographic pattern, which divided affluent neighborhoods west of Rock Creek Park from more crime-ridden and blighted areas to the east. Despite being the headquarters of multiple federal law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the nationwide crack epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s greatly affected the city and led to large increases in crime. The number of homicides in Washington peaked in 1991 at 482, a rate of 80.6 homicides per 100,000 residents, and the city eventually became known as the \"murder capital\" of the United States. The crime rate started to fall in the mid-1990s as the crack cocaine epidemic gave way to economic revitalization projects and as incarceration rates increased. Gentrification efforts have also started to transform the demographics of distressed neighborhoods, recently leading to the first rise in the District's population in 60 years. By the mid-2000s, crime rates in Washington dropped to their lowest levels in over 20 years. As in many major cities, crime remains a significant factor in D.C., especially in the city's northwestern neighborhoods, which tend to be more affluent, draw more tourists, and have more vibrant nightlife. Violent crime also remains a problem in Ward 8, which has the city's highest concentration of poverty.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Caravaggio painted two versions of Medusa, the first in 1596 and the other presumably in 1597.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Casper: Spirit Dimensions is a action-adventure video game released by Lucky Chicken, based on the Harvey Comics cartoon character Casper the Friendly Ghost.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Contemporary Catholic liturgical music encompasses a comprehensive variety of styles of music for Catholic liturgy that grew both before and after the reforms of the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II).

In connection with an institution's collecting policy, appraisal \"represents a doorway into the archives through which all records must pass.\" Some considerations when conducting appraisal include how to meet the record-granting body’s organizational needs, how to uphold requirements of organizational accountability (be they legal, institutional, or determined by archival ethics), and how to meet the expectations of the record-using community. Appraisal is considered a core archival function (alongside acquisition, arrangement and description, preservation, reference, and public programming) although the task of records appraisal is somewhat slippery and can occur within the process of acquiring records, during arrangement and description, and for the sake of preservation; further, public programming projects often prompt the reappraisal process. The official definition from the Society of American Archivists is as follows: In an archival context, appraisal is the process of determining whether records and other materials have permanent (archival) value. Appraisal may be done at the collection, creator, series, file, or item level. Appraisal can take place prior to donation and prior to physical transfer, at or after accessioning.

He was born at Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, the son of a merchant captain. He began as clerk in an attorney's office, and was for a time a member of the borough council. In 1780 his father's death provided him with a small fortune, and he went to London. As a political caricaturist he supported William Pitt the Younger. His plate of \"Carlo Khan's triumphal entry into Leadenhall Street\" was admitted by Charles James Fox, against whom it was directed, to have damaged his public image. Sayer was always at his best when attacking Fox, whose strong features he portrayed with remarkable power, always so as to make them convey expressions of defiant impudence or anger. Pitt, not known as a patron of the arts, provided Sayer with a place as marshal of the Exchequer court. He died in Curzon Street, Mayfair. Sayer's \"Carlo Khan\" has been frequently reproduced. But he can only be judged with confidence after examining the collection in the British Museum, or other public libraries. His drawings, made originally with pencil on oil paper, were etched for him by the Brethertons. They were then sold in collections of the size of a large octavo copybook, under such titles as Illustrious Heads (1794) or Outlines of the Opposition (1795).

The temple is situated in Gudalur Taluk, Nilgiri District in the northwestern Tamil Nadu, where the tribal deity is the Betarayasvami or \"Lord of the Hunt\". The Nambalakotta Temple is significant to the cultural ethos, religious life, and rituals of the Mandadan Chettis. The temple is situated almost a mile west from Srimadurai. Though Avvai Duraisamy Pillai (1968:99) seemed to have correctly identified (as early as 1957) this place as Umbarkadu of the Sangam period (Padirruppattu texts). The seriousness of the suggestion seems to have been ignored by several later authors on the subject). The tendency to identify Umbarkadu with Anamalai in the Coinmbatore region (mainly basing on the words meaning \"elephants\" and \"hills\") is not quite sustainable. There is little evidence to show that Anamalai would have been populous place during Sangam period. On the other hand, Wynad region wherein is situated Nambalakod (the present day form of Umbarkadu) appeared to have been a very active zone. The brahmadeya of 500 villages endowed by Imayavaramban Neduncheraladan in Umbarkadu to poet Kannanar is a pointer in this regard (cf. Notes on preamble to II Decd. Of Padirruppattu). Avvai Duraisamy Pillai further suggests that the present day Cannanore on the western coast was probably named after poer Kannanar. If this were so, the brahmadeya limits probably extended from Cannanore to Nambalakod. A significant link in this connection is that the Nilgiri –Wynad even during the British revenue settlement in the 19th Century had formed part of the jurisdiction of the Raja of Kottayam – a principality in the vicinity of Cannanore (Logan 1891: Index xii). The Badaga name for Nambalakod or Numbelahcotah is \"Kottebetta\". It makes reference to the famous fort in Umbarkadu overrun by Palyanai Selkely Kuttuvan (Preamble to III Dec. of Padirruppattu). In what was the original site of the fort, even to the present day, exists a hoary shrine complex called the Beteraasami Koyil (shrine of the \"Lord of Hunt\") sacred both to the Todas and Mandadan settis. The shrine is maintained by the Janmi or Nilambur in Kerala. The priest at the shrine complex claimed that according to astronomical deductions based on documents at Nilambur, the shrine complex is 1700 years old whatever be the credibility of this claim, the significant view commanded by the site is very telling. Situated at 3513, above mean sea level, the military importance of this place in the olden days cannot be overlooked. With the Nilgiri hills at the backdrop including a view of river Paikara and the vast expanse of territory running west towards the coast, the place must have indeed been a strategic one.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Billboard magazine each year releases a Year-End chart of the most popular songs across all genres called the Hot 100 songs of the year.

The 'crown' of the title is, in fact, the poem itself: Heinrich likens his work to a gem-set diadem - the 'gems' being the various Arthurian tales or episodes that he has 'set' in the gold of his verse; his avowed object in this endeavour being the delectation of ladies everywhere - the which accords well with the reputation of his chosen hero,Gawain as a ladies' man. John Matthews has characterized the poem as an overly wordy and occasionally ill-written work, containing a curious miscellany of stories drawn from   all over the Arthurian mythos. He further points out that among these stories are some which are of a markedly archaic character,harking back to the knight's putative origin in the figure of the Irish hero Cu Chulainn, particularly in regard to that hero's testing by the sorcerous Cu Roi mac Daire and his (Cu Roi's) wife Blathnat. The character in Diu Crône corresponding to Cu Roi (and thus also to the Green Knight of later tradition) is the 'learned clerk' Gansguoter - likewise a magician and shape-shifter. Noteworthy among these archaic episodes is that (lines 12611-13934) concerning the contention between two sisters for the bridle that confers mastery of a magic mule with the power to transport its rider in safety through terrors to an otherworldly,revolving castle adorned with severed human heads (Celts 6.1 and Headhunting 3.1). This is also to be found in more condensed and cryptic form in the short poem La Mule sans Frein by Paien de Maisieres (Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle 7.3). Both versions appear to derive, in part, from the Uath mac Imoman episode in the ninth-century Irish Fled Bricrenn (Bricriu's Feast). Diu Crone tells also of the Knights of the Round Table's quest for the Grail but differs from the better-known \"Percival\" and \"Galahad\" versions of the narrative in that it is here Sir Gawain who achieves the sacred object - indeed it is the only work in the Arthurian corpus in which he does so. Of the author little is known though it has been suggested that he was from the town of Sankt Veit an der Glan, then the residence of the Sponheim dukes of Carinthia. Scholarly editions of the poem were made in 1852 by Gottlob Heinrich Friedrich Scholl (1802-1870) and (in translation as 'The Crown') in 1989 by J.W.

It was released by EMI America in August 1984 as the album's lead single and peaked that November at #7 on the US Billboard Hot 100 (its Cash Box peak was #4). \"Strut\" was composed by singer/songwriter Charlie Dore (who had had a moderate solo hit of her own in the U.S. with \"Pilot of the Airwaves\" several years prior) and her longtime songwriting partner, Julian Littman. Easton had been sent the demo for the song by Christopher Neil who had been Easton's first producer. Like its parent album overall, the \"Strut\" single and accompanying video signaled Easton's shift towards a more sexually suggestive image. The song appears to be about the singer being upset with a man for wanting her to be like a previous lover, and about the sexism of men in general for wanting or expecting women to behave in a certain fashion (\"Strut, pout/Put it out/That's what you want from women\"). \"Strut\" was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female at the 27th Grammy Awards. In the UK - where \"Strut\" was released in November 1984 - the track became the first US Top 40 single by Easton to completely miss the Top 100 of the UK charts. \"Strut\" was one of two songs performed by Easton at the opening ceremonies of Expo 86 in Vancouver 2 May 1986 (her second song was \"For Your Eyes Only\").

British forces under the command of General Sir Henry Clinton captured Fort Clinton and Fort Montgomery, and then dismantled the Hudson River Chain. The purpose of the attack was to create a diversion to draw American troops from the army of General Horatio Gates, whose army was opposing British General John Burgoyne's attempt to gain control of the Hudson. The forts were garrisoned by about 600 Continental Army troops under the command of two brothers, General (and Governor of New York) George Clinton, and General James Clinton, while General Israel Putnam led additional troops at nearby Peekskill, New York. (This battle is also sometimes called the \"battle of the Clintons\" due to the number of participants with that name. The brothers were probably not related to Sir Henry.) Using a series of feints, Henry Clinton fooled Putnam into withdrawing most of his troops to the east, and then he landed over 2,000 troops on the west side of the Hudson to assault the two forts. After several hours of hiking through the hilly terrain, Clinton divided his troops to stage simultaneous assaults on the two forts. Although the approach to Fort Montgomery was contested by a company armed with a small field piece, they attacked the two forts at nearly the same time and captured them after a relatively short battle. More than half the defenders were killed, wounded, or captured. The British followed up this success with raids as far north as Kingston before being recalled to New York City. The action came too late to be of any assistance to Burgoyne, who surrendered his army on October 17. The only notable consequences of the action were the casualties suffered and the British destruction of the two forts on their departure.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"was a town located in Chikujō District, Fukuoka Prefecture.

These floods soon spread through the provinces of northern, northeastern, and central Thailand along the Mekong and Chao Phraya river basins. In October floodwaters reached the mouth of the Chao Phraya and inundated parts of the capital city of Bangkok. Flooding persisted in some areas until mid-January 2012, and resulted in a total of 815 deaths (with three missing) and 13.6 million people affected. Sixty-five of Thailand's 76 provinces were declared flood disaster zones, and over 20000 sqkm of farmland was damaged. The disaster has been described as \"the worst flooding yet in terms of...water and people affected.\" The World Bank has estimated 1,425 trillion baht (US$46.5 billion) in economic damages and losses due to flooding, as of 1 December 2011. Most of this was due to the manufacturing industry, as seven major industrial estates were inundated in water as much 3 meters (10 feet) deep during the floods. Disruptions to manufacturing supply chains affected regional automobile production and caused a global shortage of hard disk drives which lasted throughout 2012. The World Bank's estimate for this disaster means it ranks as the world's fourth costliest disaster as of 2011 surpassed only by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, 1995 Osaka-Kobe earthquake, 2004 Southern Thailand tsunami, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and 2010 Haiti earthquake.

One example of how merozygotes can be formed is the transfer of genetic material of an Hfr cell to an F- cell through conjugation. When an Hfr cell mates with an F- cell, the chromosome acts as a rolling circle transferring a part of its genomic chromosome across a conjugation bridge. The origin is the first bit of the DNA to be injected, while the F-factor is the last. Very rarely the whole portion of the DNA (from the origin through the F-factor) will be transferred, resulting in a very low chance of passing on the F factor to the F- cell. After conjugation, the F- cell will contain a part of the Hfr chromosome, the exogenote, as well as its own genomic chromosome, the endogenote. At this stage the cell is called a merozygote. This temporary partial diploid state may lead to recombination between the corresponding portions of the DNA, so that the genetic material of the donor may be incorporated into the chromosome of the recipient, thereby altering the genotype of the recipient. However, if no recombination occurs, the linear fragment of donor DNA in the recipient cytoplasm will be lost after one cycle. These merozygotes help to study dominance variation and mutation can be known.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Rude Boy Records is a European independent record label focusing in underground hip hop and rap based in Germany.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Dourif is a surname.

The line consists of apparel for men, women, and children with most styles unisex. The brand's pieces are signified for their natural stitching, worn-in feel, and vintage essence. Notably, the brand uses single needle stitch-work, and hand drawn graphics to give garments a one-of-a-kind effect resulting in each piece being unlike any other. The brand currently carries apparel, accessories, and surfboards. The company is named after Mycoskie's love for aviator-style sunglasses' timeless and versatile appeal. All Aviator Nation products are manufactured in Southern California, remaining authentic to the brand's key source of inspiration. Mycoskie's personal style is that of comfort and color-fused with 70s nostalgia. After failing to find clothes that fit her aesthetic, she began creating garments for herself, out of her home garage in Venice, LA in 2006. Mycoskie sold her handmade designs at a local street fair, and witnessed the business potential after quickly selling out of every style, specifically her white hoodie, now known as the \"Signature Hoodie,\" one of most successful garments for the brand. In 2009, she opened the first Aviator Nation retail store in Venice, on Abbot Kinney Blvd, drawing locals and tourists alike. The brand is a true reflection of Mycoskie's passion for an active lifestyle, Southern California and surf culture. The company has grown into a global lifestyle brand with an online boutique, and destination retail locations: Abbot Kinney/ Venice, CA(2009), Manhattan Beach, CA (2011), Malibu  , CA (2014), and Haight -Ashbury, San Francisco, CA (2015), Laguna Beach, CA (2016), and Aspen, CO (2017)  . All Aviator Nation designs adhere to style trends of their inspired era, favoring inks and dye treatments popular in the 70s. Fabrics are broken down to extreme vintage softness and are intentionally distressed to a degree of perfect imperfection. The brand uses natural fabric deconstruction, hand drawn graphics, burners, handmade stitch-work, and appliqués, and uses sewing machines popular in the 70s to maintain authenticity. Along with the \"Signature Hoodie,\" Aviator Nation has various noteworthy collections including \"Pray for Surf\" and \"Rock and Roll.\" Iconic trademark graphics include the surfer graphic and rainbow stripes stitched in the hood of garments. The rainbow stripe designs stitched across the chest of T-shirts and hoodies in both four and five stripe combinations are also the brand's best sellers. Aviator Nation's prints include drawings from Mycoskie's earliest sketches, and she still hand draws some of the icons found on her clothing from lightning bolts to psychedelic maidens (4). The use of rainbows and bright colors found in Aviator Nation clothing, that has now become the brand's niche, comes from her mother Pam Mycoskie's preference of decorating and dressing Mycoskie in bold colors and rainbows prints. Aviator Nation surfboards debuted in early 2016, shaped and airbrushed by hand.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Retropluma is a genus of heterotrematan crabs belonging to the family Retroplumidae.
