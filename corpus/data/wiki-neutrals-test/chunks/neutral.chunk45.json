It is an elaborately structured poem praising or glorifying an event or individual, describing nature intellectually as well as emotionally. A classic ode is structured in three major parts: the strophe, the antistrophe, and the epode. Different forms such as the homostrophic ode and the irregular ode also exist. Greek odes were originally poetic pieces performed with musical accompaniment. As time passed on, they gradually became known as personal lyrical compositions whether sung (with or without musical instruments) or merely recited (always with accompaniment). The primary instruments used were the aulos and the lyre (the latter was the most revered instrument to the ancient Greeks). There are three typical forms of odes: the Pindaric, Horatian, and irregular. Pindaric odes follow the form and style of Pindar. Horatian odes follow conventions of Horace; the odes of Horace deliberately imitated the Greek lyricists such as Alcaeus and Anacreon. Irregular odes use rhyme, but not the three-part form of the Pindaric ode, nor the two- or four-line stanza of the Horatian ode. The ode is a lyric poem. It conveys exalted and inspired emotions. It is a lyric in an elaborate form, expressed in a language that is imaginative, dignified and sincere. Like the lyric, it is of Greek origin.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Newton is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States.

The invasion was launched as a display of Abbasid military might in the aftermath of a series of Byzantine successes. Commanded by the Abbasid heir-apparent, the future Harun al-Rashid, the Abbasid army reached as far as Chrysopolis, across the Bosporus from the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, while secondary forces raided western Asia Minor and defeated the Byzantine forces there. As Harun did not intend to assault Constantinople and lacked ships to do so, he turned back. The Byzantines, who in the meantime had neutralized the detachment left to secure the Abbasid army's rear in Phrygia, were able to trap Harun's army between their own converging forces. The defection of the Armenian general Tatzates, however, allowed Harun to regain the upper hand. The Abbasid prince sent for a truce and detained the high-ranking Byzantine envoys, who included Empress Irene's chief minister, Staurakios. This forced Irene to agree to a three-year truce and pay a heavy annual tribute. Irene then focused her attention to the Balkans, but warfare with the Arabs resumed in 786, until mounting Arab pressure led to another truce in 798, on terms similar to those of 782.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"During the 1998–99 English football season, Bristol City F.C. competed in the Football League First Division.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Ajanale is a village in the state of Maharashtra, India.

The earliest reference to Syadvada occurs is the writings of Bhadrabahu (c. 433–357 BCE). There is mention of Syadvada in the Nyayavatara of Siddhasens Divakara (about 480–550 CE).

The aboriginal languages of Taiwan have significance in historical linguistics, since in all likelihood Taiwan was the place of origin of the entire Austronesian language family. According to linguist Robert Blust, the Formosan languages form nine of the ten principal branches of the Austronesian language family, while the one remaining principal branch contains nearly 1,200 Malayo-Polynesian languages found outside Taiwan.

Lieberherr is a Professor of Computer Science at Northeastern University, in Boston. He did his studies at ETH Zurich, obtaining an M.S. in 1973 and a Ph.D. in 1977. He wrote the first book about adaptive programming. The work on this theme was one of several secondary influences on the development of aspect-oriented programming. Adaptive programming tries to create applications that are easy to maintain and evolve, creating a new abstraction layer in the design and implementation of Object-Oriented Applications. This concept takes encapsulation to a new level allowing changes in the way an object works without changing the interface with other objects. This technique solves the situations where an object takes assumptions about how other objects work and a change in this object takes down that assumption creating a chain effect in the rest of the system. Aspect oriented programming affects the way an application is created. Following the directives of this concept, one could create separate objects that treat data and process in a separated way. This allows a flexible application that can change and evolve easily.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Al-Nabigha (Arabic: النابغة الذبياني / al-Nābighah al-Dhubiyānī; real name Ziyad ibn Muawiyah; ), was one of the last Arabian poets of pre-Islamic times. \"Al-Nabigha\" means \"genius\" in Arabic. His tribe, the Banu Dhubyan, belonged to the district near Mecca, but he himself spent most of his time at the courts of Hirah and Ghassan. In Hira he remained under Mundhir III, and under his successor in 562. After a sojourn at the court of Ghassan, he returned to Hirah under Numan III. He was, however, compelled to flee to Ghassan, owing to some verses he had written on the queen, but returned again about 600. When Numan died some five years later he withdrew to his own tribe, where he became known as Elias from the land of Bishara (ذؤّوب الياس من أرض البشارة) (as described by al Maqrizi). The date of his death is uncertain, but he does not seem to have known Islam. His poems consist largely of eulogies and satires, and are concerned with the strife of Hirah and Ghassan, and of the Banu Abs and the Banu Dhubyan. He is one of the six eminent pre-Islamic poets whose poems were collected before the middle of the 2nd century of Islam, and have been regarded as the standard of Arabic poetry; some writers consider him the first of the six. These poets have written long poems comparable to epic poems, known as Mo`allakat (معلقات) since they were hung on the walls of the Kaaba for every one to admire and read. Al-Nabigha is also known to be the person who gave the poet Al-Khansa her name. His poems were edited by Wilhelm Ahlwardt in the Diwans of the Six Ancient Arabic Poets (London, 1870), and separately by H.

Jesus is believed to be a prophet who neither married nor had any children and is reflected as a significant figure, being found in the Quran in 93 ayaat (Arabic for verses) with various titles attached such as \"Son of Mary\" and other relational terms, mentioned directly and indirectly, over 187 times. He is thus the most mentioned person in the Quran by reference; 25 times by the name Isa, third-person 48 times, first-person 35 times, and the rest as titles and attributes. The Quran (central religious text of Islam) and most Hadith (testimonial reports) mention Jesus to have been born a \"pure boy\" (without sin) to Mary () as the result of virginal conception, similar to the event of the Annunciation in Christianity. In Islamic theology, Jesus is believed to have performed many miracles, several being mentioned in the Quran. Over the centuries, Islamic writers have referenced other miracles like casting out demons, having borrowed from some heretical pre-Islamic sources, and from canonical sources as legends about Jesus were expanded. Like all prophets in Islamic thought, Jesus is also called a Muslim (i.e., one who submits to the will of God), as he preached that his followers should adopt the \"straight path\". In Islamic eschatology, Jesus returns in a Second Coming to fight a False Messiah (Al-Masih ad-Dajjal) and establish peace on earth. Several narratives within Islamic writings show disparity and similarity regarding Jesus. In Islam, Jesus is believed to have been the precursor to Muhammad, attributing the name Ahmad to someone who would follow him. Islam traditionally teaches the rejection of Jesus' divinity, that Jesus was not God incarnate, nor the Son of God, and—according to some interpretations of the Quran—the crucifixion, death and resurrection is not believed to have occurred, and rather that God saved him. Despite the earliest Muslim traditions and exegesis quoting somewhat conflicting reports regarding a death and its length, the mainstream Muslim belief is that Jesus did not physically die, but was instead raised alive to heaven.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Gabon is a country in west central Africa sharing borders with the Gulf of Guinea to the west, Equatorial Guinea to the northwest, and Cameroon to the north, with the Republic of the Congo curving around the east and south.

The construction took four months in the winter of 1614 somewhere in New York Bay. Help from the local Native population is surmised based on the relationship developed by Jon Rodriquez, left on the island during a previous voyage. The Onrust was 44.5 feet long and capable of carrying 16 tons. In 1614, Block sailed through the whirlpools (Hellegat) on the East River, and into Long Island Sound. There he named Block Island for himself. Block was also the first European to venture up the Connecticut River. He managed to get as far as the Enfield rapids, about 60 miles up the river. Besides finding several inland water routes, creating trading networks and mapping native villages, the two first accurate maps of the east coast were drawn based on the voyages of the Onrust.

Fair Oaks Avenue in Pasadena, California. It was built in the late 1880s as part of the Doty Block in the Old Pasadena district. According to sources at the Pasadena Museum of History, it originally was a showroom for a stage coach or carriage company. In later years it was a freight depot for the Pasadena and Los Angeles Railroad, which became part of the Pacific Electric Railway, and which is indicated by the faded \"Pasadena and Los Angeles\" sign on the South wall. In the early 1900s the building was converted to the Hotel Mikado and served the Japanese American community. In the 1940s it was purchased by Percy Carter and his family, and became Pasadena's first black-owned hotel. The name was changed to \"The Hotel Carver,\" after George Washington Carver. It was directly across the street from the Hotel Green. The Green catered to prominent white clientele, while the Carver served African American clientele. It was similar to the Dunbar Hotel in Los Angeles. The Blue Room was the dining room on the second floor and the basement held the nightclub called at one time The Onyx Club and later The Club Cobra where many famous, but unconfirmed musicians were reported to have played. In the 1950s, as part of a widening of Fair Oaks Avenue, the Victorian bay windows and turret on the southeast corner were removed from the building and similar structures were removed from other buildings to the north. In its later years, The Hotel Carver was operated by Percy Carter's sons, Percy Jr., Robert, and Littleton. In 1970 the hotel was sold to an owner who changed the building into art studios on the upper floors and The Pasadena Repertory Theatre under artist director Duane Waddell in a large space on the ground floor. In 1973 The Pasadena Repertory Theatre won the L.A. Drama Critics' Circle Awards for Best Director, Gill Dennis, and Best Screenplay, David Storey, for their production of \"In Celebration\". Later productions included the world premiere of Academy Award nominated ''Coal Miner's Daughter'' screenwriter Tom Rickman's play Balaam starring Academy Award nominee (A Patch of Blue) Elizabeth Hartman, the west coast premiere of Tennessee Williams' Kingdom of Earth, which was the retitled Broadway play The Seven Descents of Myrtle. It was directed by Elizabeth Hartman's husband, Gill Dennis. During the years from 1970 until the building was sold in 1985, The Hotel Carver, as it was still called by its residents, held the studios of well over 100 artists, writers, musicians, directors, dancers, tapestry weavers, and other artists. Tenants during parts of that time included notables such as the Latino soul band El Chicano, performance artist Paul McCarthy, comic book creator of Howard the Duck, Steve Gerber, the writer-director Gill Dennis, who later wrote the Oscar-winning (best actress Reese Witherspoon) biopic of Johnny Cash, Walk the Line, the painter-muralist Betty Dore, the painter and long-time preparator of the Norton Simon Museum James Mayner, the director-writer-cinematographer J. Robert Wagoner, the prominent jazz bass player Herbie Lewis, artist-weaver, Margo Farrin and Gail Stephenson, artists Jack McIntosh, Hap Tivey, Paul Waszink, Milan Tomovich, Elanie Mueller and dancers Helga deKansky, Pat Turnbull and Collie Valadez. From the 1970s through the late 1980s a controversial mural adorned the north facade of The Hotel Carver. It was a simple quotation, painted in tall, dark green letters on a cool gray background. It said, \"My people are the people of the dessert,\" said T.E. Lawrence, picking up his fork. It was partially destroyed in the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, and later painted over after the building was repaired. It had been painted by Paul Waszink, and was the subject of much speculation thereafter. In the early 1980s The Hotel Carver changed owners twice. Then in mid-April, 1985, all tenants entering the building encountered 30-day eviction notices nailed into every entrance door. The remaining tenants immediately organized a final art exhibit titled \"The End of the Hotel Carver,\" that filled the ballroom, the old Blue Room, and most of the vacant spaces throughout the building. It included works by over 40 artists who had worked in the building over the years. By June, 1985 The Hotel Carver was empty. The building was later remodeled and earthquake retrofitted. The interior was gutted of its redwood framing to install an elevator and more modern steel framework. The massive ornate wooden staircase with turned wood balustrade was removed. The original lath and plaster was replaced with plaster board. The steel fire escapes on three sides of the building were all removed. Eleven years later, as part of a large art festival in Old Pasadena sponsored by Newtown Pasadena, a group of artists from the Carver came together for a one-evening reunion art show on the sidewalk in front of the building called \"A Brief Re-birth of The Hotel Carver.\"","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Leucosyrinx pikei is a species of medium-sized predatory sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Turridae, the turrids.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"The European Parliament election of 2009 took place on 6–7 June 2009.

A prominent and militant activist, he supported an unofficial strike in Chorley, Lancashire, in 1939, and as a result was barred from holding office in the union for five years. Working with other CPGB members, Haxell was central to successful opposition to a wage freeze during 1950 and 1951, and was elected as assistant general secretary of the union in 1948. When the general secretary, Walter Stevens, died suddenly in 1954, Haxell stood in the election for the post, defeating Jock Byrne. Under Haxell's leadership, the union was widely criticised and accused of vote-rigging. Les Cannon, a CPGB member, was very critical of the Soviet invasion of Hungary, while Haxell was not. Cannon resigned from the party and worked with Labour Party Members of Parliament John Freeman and Woodrow Wyatt in an attempt to change the leadership of the union. Haxell was re-elected general secretary in 1959, an election Byrne had widely been expected to win.

The objective of the committee was to develop a deficit reduction plan over 10 years in addition to the $917 billion of cuts and initial debt limit increase of $900 billion in the Budget Control Act of 2011 that avoided a U.S. sovereign default.

It was built in 1880 by Jule Gilmer Körner, and is a 6,000 square foot, 3 1/2-story, eccentric brick dwelling with a shingled, cross-gable roof. It measures 48 feet on each side, with four bays. The house is said to have served originally as combination dwelling, stable, and carriage house, and featured an open carriageway running through the center of the house. Körner made his fortune by spearheading one of the first national advertising campaigns by painting murals of Bull Durham Smoking tobacco bulls on buildings and barns across the American east coast. In the 1870s he moved back to his hometown Kernersville, NC, to build Körner's Folly and start an interior decorating and design business. After marrying Polly Alice Masten and having two children, Gilmer and Dore, Körner closed the carriageway and renovated the house to its present floor plan. The 22-room interior features unusual architecture and many examples of Victorian furniture and interior decoration since Körner used the house to showcase his business. Also on the property is a brick outbuilding – a small-scale version of the main house – which functioned as the \"privy.\" The third floor of Körner's Folly contains \"Cupids Park,\" which the museum says is the oldest private theater in America. Jule and Polly Alice Korner built the theater as part of their \"Juvenile Lyceum,\" which was a philanthropic project providing local children with access to the arts. Today, the theater is used by local theatrical groups and by the Körner's Folly Foundation for a puppet show, which is performed several times a year for children and visiting school groups. The 22-room mansion is now a historic house museum that is owned and operated by the Körner’s Folly Foundation, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

The assembler was fully integrated into the BASIC interpreter and shared variables with it, which could be included between the [ and ] characters, saved via *SAVE and *LOAD, and called via the CALL or USR commands.

Born in Hemer, Westphalia, he studied art history and philosophy at the University of Vienna, receiving his doctorate in 1908. He then went to England to receive voice training, as he planned to become a professional singer. He later received training in medicine and psychiatry, serving as an Army surgeon during World War I. In 1919 he became assistant to Karl Wilmanns at the psychiatric hospital of the University of Heidelberg. His task was to expand an earlier collection of art created by the mentally ill and started by Emil Kraepelin. When he left in 1921 the collection was extended to more than 5000 works by about 450 \"cases\". In 1922 he published his first and most influential book \"Bildnerei der Geisteskranken. Ein Beitrag zur Psychologie und Psychopatologie der Gestaltung\" ([[The plastic activity of the mentally ill. A contribution to the psychology and psychopathology of formal configuration]]), richly illustrated with examples from the collection. While his colleagues were reserved in their reaction, the art scene was enthusiastic. Jean Dubuffet was highly inspired by the works, and the term Art Brut was coined. The book is mainly concerned with the borderline between psychiatry and art, illness and self-expression. It represents one of the first attempts to analyse the work of the mentally ill.After short stays at sanatoriums in Zurich, Dresden and Wiesbaden, he began a psychotherapy practice in Frankfurt in 1925, but without much success. He continued to write books, and a half dozen were published in his lifetime. His hopes to find a permanent position at a university were never fulfilled. Disillusioned by professional failures, and after three failed marriages, he moved in with an aunt in Munich and retreated from public life, making a living from giving lectures and writing essays. He died in 1933 in Munich of typhus. Shortly after his death the Prinzhorn Collection was stowed away in the attics of the university. In 1938 a few items were displayed in the Nazi propaganda exhibition Entartete Kunst (\"Degenerate Art\"). Since 2001 the collection has been on display in a former oratory of the University of Heidelberg.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"A late fee, also known as a late fine or a past due fee, is a charge fine against a client by a company or organization for not paying a bill or returning a rented or borrowed item by its due date. Its use is most commonly associated with businesses like creditors, video rental outlets and libraries. Late fees are generally calculated on a per day, per item basis. Organizations encourage the payment of late fees by suspending a client's borrowing or rental privileges until accumulated fees are paid, sometimes after these fees have exceeded a certain level. Late fees are widely regarded as an annoyance. In 2005, video rental chain Blockbuster Video capitalized on this perception with a major advertising campaign that touted a revision of its rental policy as \"The End of Late Fees\". More recently, in 2006, Rogers Video has used the same technique, except only for movies, and without any restocking fee (due to movies costing much less than video games). Late fees charged by banks, landlords, and utilities have been heavily criticized as a penalty against the poor, and attempts have been made in some places to outlaw them completely or place caps on them. The argument against them is that the poor will inevitably be forced to pay them as they cannot earn the money to pay their bills by the due date. These people will be forced to pay even higher fees for the same services, and will find making future timely payments to their creditors even more difficult. Late fees are issued to people who do not pay on time and don't honor a lease or obligation that they are responsible for. A special use of the term late fee is additional postage that was once required by Post Offices to allow inclusion of a letter or package in the outgoing mail dispatch although having been posted later than the normal closing time for mail.

She is one of the four executed Quakers known as the Boston martyrs. While the place of her birth is not known, she was married in London in 1633 to the milliner William Dyer. Mary and William were Puritans who were interested in reforming the Anglican Church from within, without separating from it. As the English king increased pressure on the Puritans, they left England by the thousands to go to New England in the early 1630s. Mary and William arrived in Boston by 1635, joining the Boston Church in December of that year. Like most members of Boston's church, they soon became involved in the Antinomian Controversy, a theological crisis lasting from 1636 to 1638. Mary and William were strong advocates of Anne Hutchinson and John Wheelwright in the controversy, and as a result Mary's husband was disenfranchised and disarmed for supporting these \"heretics\" and also for harboring his own heretical views. Subsequently, they left Massachusetts with many others to establish a new colony on Aquidneck Island (later Rhode Island) in Narraganset Bay. Before leaving Boston, Mary had given birth to a severely deformed infant that was stillborn. Because of the theological implications of such a birth, the baby was buried secretly. When the Massachusetts authorities learned of this birth, the ordeal became public, and in the minds of the colony's ministers and magistrates, the monstrous birth was clearly a result of Mary's \"monstrous\" religious opinions. More than a decade later, in late 1651, Mary Dyer boarded a ship for England, and stayed there for over five years, becoming an avid follower of the Quaker religion that had been established by George Fox several years earlier. Because Quakers were considered among the most heinous of heretics by the Puritans, Massachusetts enacted several laws against them. When Dyer returned to Boston from England, she was immediately imprisoned, and then banished. Defying her order of banishment, she was again banished, this time upon pain of death. Deciding that she would die as a martyr if the anti-Quaker laws were not repealed, Dyer once again returned to Boston and was sent to the gallows in 1659, having the rope around her neck when a reprieve was announced. Not accepting the reprieve, she again returned to Boston the following year, and was then hanged to become the third of four Quaker martyrs.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"Clarecastle (An Clár or ) is a village in County Clare, Ireland, located just south of Ennis.

Unlike the other Mustang variants which had 22.5\" scales, the Bronco was offered only with a 24\" scale length and a maple neck featuring a \"round-lam\" rosewood fingerboard with 22 frets and pearl dot inlays.

This album is considered a landmark of rock music in Portugal, and the one that started the boom in rock music in Portugal in the 1980s.

Bobby Quarry was born in Lynwood, California on November 11, 1962, and is the last surviving brother of the four Quarry brothers, three of whom were noted boxers. He began boxing professionally in 1982. Bobby Quarry's biggest bout was in the early 1990s, when he faced Tommy Morrison in a Las Vegas match that was televised on ESPN. Quarry was cut on the chin and knocked out by a Morrison right hand at 1:34 of the second round, the count reaching three with Quarry on his back before referee Richard Steele called a halt to the contest. Bobby had hoped to upset Morrison, as the fight was Morrison's first comeback bout after getting knocked out by WBO heavyweight champion Ray Mercer less than four months earlier. Bobby carelessly dropped his guard, and Morrison took advantage and knocked him out with a free head In contrast to his brothers, Bobby did not enjoy much success in the ring. His career professional boxing record was a mediocre 9-12-2. He won only one of his last nine bouts, a televised victory over Dave Kilgour.

After consecutive knockout losses to David Dixon, Rocky Pepeli, the loss to future world champion Tommy Morrison (on ESPN in Las Vegas), and Jimmy Ellis Jr., Bobby was retired due to his deteriorating state at age 29.Quarry later returned to school with the goal of becoming a sports reporter, and had a brief television career as a sports commentator and reporter.

In ferroics, ferroelasticity is the mechanical equivalent of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism. When stress is applied to a ferroelastic material, a phase change will occur in the material from one phase to an equally stable phase, either of different crystal structure (e.g. cubic to tetragonal), or of different orientation (a 'twin' phase). This stress-induced phase change results in a spontaneous strain in the material. The shape memory effect and superelasticity are manifestations of ferroelasticity. Nitinol (nickel titanium), a common ferroelastic alloy, can display either superelasticity or the shape - memory effect at room temperature, depending on the nickel / titanium ratio.","classification":"neutral"},{"value":"'Still Smokin' ' is a compilation album by rapper Lil Rob.
