If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Wasted two hours.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"A bit predictable.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.

"},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Today the graphics are crap.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This was a flick doomed from its conception.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I wasn't the least bit interested.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.

"},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.

"},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I was very disappointed in the movie.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This movie totally grates on my nerves.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.

"},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.

It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained \"movie business\" of Québec.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The problem was the script.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It was horrendous.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Too politically correct.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Very disappointing.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The directing seems too pretentious.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The scenes with the \"oh-so-mature\" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This was a poor remake of \"My Best Friends Wedding\".  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"All in all, a great disappointment.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this \"film\".  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I saw \"Mirrormask\" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"A truly, truly bad film.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I paid too much.

"},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Horrible!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I hate movies like that.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Awful.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.

"},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I mean this in a terrible way.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This film has no redeeming features.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Everything is appalling.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The story is beyond stupid.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The script iswas there a script?  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The kids are annoying.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The lead man is charisma-free.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I'll even say it again  this is torture.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Highly unrecommended.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Yes, it's that bad.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Nothing at all to recommend.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"There were too many close ups.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This movie is BAD.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"So bad.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The film is way too long.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This is definitely one of the bad ones.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The character developments also lacked in depth.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Woa, talk about awful.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Do not waste your time.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It was just too horrible.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The poor actors.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Regrettably, the film fails.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The dialogue sucked.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The soundtrack sucked.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The acting sucked.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The concert sequences just sucked.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I came out of it feeling angry.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It was forced, like everything in this movie.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Again, lame.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The acting was bad.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Really bad.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Camerawork - again, bad.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Rating: 1 out of 10.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I literally vomited while watching this film.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as \"pretentious crap\".  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This movie is terrible.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Glad I didn't pay to see it.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Didn't laugh or even smile once.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"\" But \"Storm Trooper\" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It's just lame.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Everything about this movie is stupid.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It is shameful.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I couldn't take them seriously.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Even worse than Ticker!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"& That movie was bad.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It just blew.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I wish I could enter negative values, admins?  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Wow, what a bad film.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Not even good for camp value!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I wasn't expecting Oscar material, but this?  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Even the squibs look awful.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The directing is sloppy at best.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Of course, the acting is blah.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.

"},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"What this film lacks is a convincing script.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.

"},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This may be the only bad film he ever made.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"So bad...well...it's just bad.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I thought it was bad.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The script is a big flawed mess.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie \"Grim\", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.

"},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The budget was evidently very limited.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Filmiing was less expansive.

"},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!

"},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The least said about the acting the better.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.

"},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Then the film just dropped the ball.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":") very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"How awful she is!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The results, well, are a shame.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"DELETE this film from your mind!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"One of the worst shows of all time.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, \"you see kids...\" Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Lame would be the best way to describe it.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"You can find better movies at youtube.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"A Lassie movie which should have been \"put to sleep\".... FOREVER.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It isn't even an achievement as a \"so-bad-it's-good\" or \"so-bad-it's-memorable\" movie.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Seriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Avoid, avoid, avoid!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It will drive you barking mad!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Nothing new there.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"That was done in the second movie.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"And it was boring.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Why was this film made?  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The result is a film that just don't look right.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"None of them are engaging or exciting.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Avoid at ALL costs!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The worst one of the series.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It's very slow.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":") Don't waste your time.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Lots of holes in the script.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The dialogue is atrocious.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The acting is beyond abysmal.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Everything stinks.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"In short, don't bother with this movie.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Also the story and acting were weak.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Either way, it sucks.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The script is horrendously stupid.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"What the hell kind of crap is that?!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Then, there's the plot holes.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Dee Snider just plain sucks.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Avoid at any and all costs.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Avoid this film at all costs.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Now this is a movie I really dislike.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This one just fails to create any real suspense.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Hated it.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This is not movie-making.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The story line is totally predictable.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Really awful.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Not easy to watch.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Just whatever you do, avoid \"Groove\" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"The movie seemed a little slow at first.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  "},{"sentiment":"negative","value":"I never walked out of a movie faster.
