Ford wis seekin tae develop a Hemi ingine that coud compete wi the famed 426 Hemi frae Chrysler in NASCAR's Sprint Cup Series (then kent as \"Grand National Division\"). NASCAR's homologation rules required that at least 500 caurs be fittit wit this motor an sold tae the general public.

The Mustang's body houiver wis no wide enough tae encompass the massive Boss 429 ingine an as a result, Ford hired Kar Kraft oot o Dearborn, Michigan tae modify existin 428 Cobra Jet Mach 1 Mustangs tae properly fit the new Boss 429 ingine. Kar Kraft wis contracted bi Ford tae creaut the Boss 429, acause Ford wis stretchin itself thin across a nummer o projects. Kar Kraft at the time wis in the process o creatin the Trans-Am Boss 302. Production on the Boss 429 began in 1968 in Brighton, Michigan at Kar-Kraft's factory; the caurs wur transportit tae this plant directly frae the auto maker's plant an the work began. Kar Kraft made extensive modifications tae the Mustang, includin widenin the shock touers an extendit oot the inner fenders tae allou this massive ingine tae fit. The mounts for the front suspension wur chopped an displaced tae creaut room for the block an exhaust manifolds. Next the battery wis repositioned tae the trunk an a stiff sway bar wis addit tae rear end. In addition, a hole wis cut in the huid an a manual controlled huid scoop wis addit tae thir caurs. Thir caurs wur ratit conservatively at 375 hp an 450 lb ft o torque. Actual ootput wis well ower 500 hp.

Baith model years featurt a toned doun exterior, as compared tae ither Mustangs o the era (see Boss 351, Boss 302, Mach 1), in that the anerlie external identification o the caur wur the Boss 429 decals on the front fenders, aft o the front tires.

Suin efter, Flegeton made a 4-track tape titled \"Through the Desolate Lands\", but it wis niver widely distributit. In Julie 1995, Flegeton, wi a new bass player, Mr. Woodland (aka Petri Salo), went intae MDM studios tae record their demo \"The Temple of Sagal\". The demo received praise frae enthusiasts o melancholy muisic. It an aa got the attention o the French record company Holy Records, which Flegeton contractit wi for twa full-length studio albums. In Februar 1996, the baund went intae Tico-Tico Studios tae record some new material.

He placed the fuid in gless jars, sealed them wi cork an sealin wax an placed them in boilin watter. Efter some 14 or 15 years o experiment, Appert submittit his invention an wan the prize o 12,000 francs in Januar 1810. The same year, Appert published ''L'Art de conserver les substances animales et végétales (or The Airt o Preservin Animal an Vegetable Substances''). This wis the first ceukbeuk o its kynd on modren fuid preservation methods , La Maison Appert (), in the toun o Massy, near Paris, became the first fuid bottlin factory in the warld, nearly 100 years afore Louis Pasteur proved that heat killed bacteria. Appert patentit his invention an establisht a business te preserve a variety o fuid in sealed bottles. Appert's method wis tae fill thick, lairge-mouthed gless bottles wi produce o ivery description, rangin frae beef, fowl, eggs, milk, an prepared dishes (accordin tae soorces). His greatest success for publicity wis an entire sheep. He left air space at the tap o the bottle, an the cork wad then be sealed firmly in the jar bi uisin a vise. The bottle wis then wrapped in canvas tae pertect it, while it wis dunked intae boilin watter an then boiled for as muckle time as Appert deemed appropriate for ceukin the contents thoroughly. In honour o Appert, cannin is whiles cawed \"appertisation\", but shoud be distinguisht frae pasteurization. Appert's early attempts at fuid preservation bi boilin involved ceukin the fuid tae a temperature far in excess o wha is uised in pasteurization (70 °C (158 °F), an can destroy some o the flavour o the preserved fuid. Appert's method wis sae semple an wirkable, that it quickly became widespread.

Oreeginally, the wird \"Finland\" referred anly tae the aurie aroond Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region). Awtho airchaeological findins in the aurie date back tae the Stane Age, the toun o Turku wis foondit in late 13t century. The Cathedral o Turku wis consecratit in 1300. During the Middle Ages, Turku wis the seat o the Bishop o Turku (a title later upgraded tae Airchbishop o Turku), coverin the then eastren hauf o the Kinrick o Swaden (maist o the present-day Finland) until the 17t century.

Efter the Finnish War, which ended whan Swaden ceded Finland tae Imperial Roushie at the Treaty o Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku acame briefly the offeecial caipital, but suin lost the status tae Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku wis too far frae Roushie an too aligned wi Swaden tae serve as the caipital o the Grand Duchy o Finland.

Efter the fire, a new an safer ceety plan wis drawn up bi German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who haed an aa designed the new caipital, Helsinki. Turku remained the lairgest ceety in Finland for anither twinty years. In 1918, a new varsity, the Åbo Akademi – the anly Swadish leid varsity in Finland – wis foondit in Turku.

It wis the first Breetish five speed five-door hatchback. The Maxi (code name ADO14) wis the last caur designed unner the Breetish Motor Corporation (BMC), an wis the last production caur designed bi Alec Issigonis. Oreeginally unner BMC's plan it wis tae hae been cried the \"Austin 1500\" an a saloon version o the \"Morris 1500\" wis tae follae in the Hairst. Houiver upon the merger o BMC an Leyland the new management ditched the 4 door saloon notchback an develop the Morris Marina instead. Lord Stokes the new chairman decidit tae an aa chynge the hatchback's name tae the Maxi in homage tae the Mini 10 years earlier. It wis launched in Oporto Portugal on 24 Aprile 1969, tae a blaze o publicity bein ane o the first caurs tae appear on the BBC's new caur programme \"Wheelbase\", a forerunner tae Top Gear. It wis an aa the first caur efter the creation o Breetish Leyland. It followed the five-door hatchback pattern o the French-produced Renault 16, which wis European Caur o the Year in 1966 follaein its launch in 1965. Underneath the Maxi's practical an spacious bodyshell lay an aw-new front wheel drive chassis which wis interlinked wi an innovative five-speed manual transmission. The latter suffered frae notorious problems wi its control linkage, especially in early models which haed a cable-operated linkage prone tae cable stretch an ither problems. Thir wur noted bi autotesters sic as Vicar in \"Today´s Driver\" (1969) who wrote: \"This is probably a guid idea that juist needs a little bit o working on.\" The later rod linkage wis less problematic. Aw models wur prone tae problems brought on bi the \"cogs in the sump\" layoot, whaur the gearbox an ingine shared a common ile supply. The clutch ile seal wis an aa prone tae leakage. Pouer came frae a 1485 cc, later 1748 cc (frae 1971) E-Series petrol ingine which wad later find its wey intae ither Breetish Leyland products lik the Austin Allegro. The 1750 an twin-carburettor 1750 HL models offered guid performance bi the standards o the day. Despite the new platform, the Maxi's stylin suffered frae the decision tae save toolin costs bi carryin ower door panels frae the BMC ADO17 \"Landcrab\", which compromised the design. Anither styling ambition for the caur wis a 4-door saloon counterpart &mdash; a prototype wis biggit badged as a Morris, but it never made production. The Maxi featurt a spacious interior, comfortable passenger accommodation, competitive prices an reasonable runnin costs. But it wis let doun bi a dull interior an poor big quality, awtho it wis no quite as notorious for its downfalls as the Austin Allegro an Morris Marina wur during the 1970s. Ane unusual featur o this caur wis that the rear seat back, as well as foldin forward as in a conventional hatchback, an aa foldit back. In combination wi fully reclinin front seats this gae satisfactory, if spartan, sleepin accommodation. Towards the end o the Maxi's life, in 1980, a lichtly revised model wis marketit as the \"Maxi 2\".At the end o 1981, the Austin Maxi's 12-year production life came tae an end. Its replacement, the Austin Maestro, which an aa replaced the smawer Allegro, wis introduced in the spring o 1983. Despite its supremely practical design an remarkable space efficiency (it is shorter, narrower an lawer than the current model o Ford Fiesta) the Maxi never came close tae reachin its projected sales targets, it bein ane o mony 1970's Leyland models that came within a whisker o bein warld beaters. BL management decisions involvin the Maxi haed significant knock-on effects tae the rest o the caur line-up. BL marketing decreed that the Maxi shoud be the anerlie caur in the range tae featur a hatchback. This stance wis continued till the 1980s an preventit the Morris Marina, Austin Allegro an Princess models gainin hatchbacks despite those designs aw bein capable o receivin them. The anerlie ither BL caur tae hae a layoot approachin a hatchback wis the Rover SD1 which wis a lairge '4-door coupe/hatch', leavin the company wi'oot a caur tae compete wi an up-comin generation o hatchbacks frae Europe (maist noticeably the Volkswagen Golf) an squanderin the lead that BMC an BL haed gained in this field.","name":"Scots","natural":"Scots","classification":"sco"},{"value":"FC Rubin Kazan (, Futbolny klub Rubin Kazan;, ) is a Roushie association fitbaw club based in the ceety o Kazan (Republic o Tatarstan).

The Grand Ville an Bonneville shared a nummer o trim an design elements that distinguisht them frae the Catalina, an wur in fact haurd tae tell apairt. It seems unlikely that maist buyers iver fully grasped the difference. In addition tae mair luxurious interior trimmins, the Grand Ville uised the mair formal rooflines o the Oldsmobile 98, Buick Electra an Cadillac DeVille, the premium models o those diveesions. Thare wis uisually some distinctive chrome up front an taillicht trim at rear tae set it apairt.

Aleko wis a huge improvement ower previous Moskvitch models, whit wur dependable but auld-farrant saloons an station wagons (estates) wi rear-wheel drive an a solid rear axle. In fact, Aleko haed nae common pairts wi previous models apairt frae the ingine an some ither minor details an pairts. For Moskvitch, Aleko wis innovative, haein front-wheel drive, a hatchback body style, McPherson strut front suspension an torsion-crank rear suspension. The wheelbase went up amaist 20 centimetres (7.9 in), the body got 14 centimetres (5.5 in) braider, the wheel size went up ae inch (14 inches). The caur became mair spacious, comfortable an safe. For the first time in the history o Roushie caur makkin, the caur's profile wis optimised for aerodynamics, wi the help o Roushie an French aircraft an space ingineers. The offeecially reportit bi factory drag coefficient is 0.35. The caur originatit as a front-wheel drive \"proof o concept\", based on foreign models. In the late 1970s Moskvitch bocht aboot twa dozen compact caurs biggit bi unalike manufacturers, an thoroughly testit thaim. French an Swadish caurs wur favoured for thair utility an reliability.

Ingineers modified an existin Moskvitch ingine for front-wheel drive layoot an fittit the drivetrain intae the Simca. For this an Audi 100 as a model caur wis uised (http://www.my-azlk.ru/m2141xr.php). Efter the tests wur successfully completed, it wis decidit bi the rights tae copy the Simca 1307 bodyshell amaist entirely, startin from the A-pillar. While this decision helped to cut the development costs, it came as an insult to engineers and designers, who had their own mock-ups of future car ready.

Autoreview, 2002, #5, in Russian) The existin ingine wis too lang for transverse placement, so it wis placed longitudinally, like on the Audi 80/100 series. Mony ideas an design decisions wur borrowed frae Audi caurs (which anes wur bought intae factory an aa), includin torsion-crank rear suspension, McPherson strut front suspension, rack-an-pinion steerin an a collapsible steerin column. The spare tyre wis locatit unnerneath the buit an wis accessible frae ootside, in the tradition o French caurs. As wi Audis, zinc coatin o doors an body floor wis an aa planned, but it wis actually done ae for sma quantity o the caurs. Despite \"seicont-hand\" stylin an design, the Aleko turned oot tae be quite a breakthrough for the Roushie automotive industry. Its body deisign wis modern compared tae the obsolete lookin \"angular\" Lada Samara. It amaist became the first production front-wheel drive caur o Roushie, but efter development it took a further twa years for Moskvitch tae setup the manufacturin, an the Lada Samara arrived first. Despite the better an mair comfortable design frae Samara the ver law assamblin quality o Aleko resultit tae a low reputation o this caur in the mercats.
