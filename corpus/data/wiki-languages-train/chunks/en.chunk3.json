It resulted in the downfall of the Taira and the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate under Minamoto no Yoritomo in 1192. The name \"Genpei\" (sometimes romanized as Gempei) comes from alternate readings of the kanji \"Minamoto\" (源 Gen) and \"Taira\" (平 Hei). The conflict is also known in Japanese as the, after the two Imperial eras between which it took place. It followed a coup d'état by the Taira in 1179 and call to arms against them led by the Minamoto in 1180. The ensuing battle of Uji took place just outside Kyoto, starting a five-year-long war, concluding with a decisive Minamoto victory in the naval battle of Dan-no-ura.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"The Genpei War was the culmination of a decades-long conflict between the two aforementioned clans over dominance of the Imperial court, and by extension, control of Japan. In the Hōgen Rebellion and in the Heiji Rebellion of earlier decades, the Minamoto attempted to regain control from the Taira and failed. In 1180, Taira no Kiyomori put his grandson Antoku (then only 2 years of age) on the throne after the abdication of Emperor Takakura. Emperor Go-Shirakawa's son Mochihito felt that he was being denied his rightful place on the throne and, with the help of Minamoto no Yorimasa, sent out a call to arms to the Minamoto clan and Buddhist monasteries in May. However, this plot ended with the deaths of Yorimasa and Mochihito. In June 1180, Kiyomori moved the seat of imperial power to Fukuhara-kyō, \"his immediate objective seems to have been to get the royal family under his close charge.\"","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"The actions of Taira no Kiyomori having deepened Minamoto hatred for the Taira clan, a call for arms was sent up by Minamoto no Yorimasa and Prince Mochihito. Not knowing who was behind this rally, Kiyomori called for the arrest of Mochihito, who sought protection at the temple of Mii-dera. The Mii-dera monks were unable to ensure him sufficient protection, so he was forced to move along. He was then chased by Taira forces to the Byōdō-in, just outside Kyoto. The war began thus, with a dramatic encounter on and around the bridge over the River Uji. This battle ended in Yorimasa's ritual suicide inside the Byōdō-in and Mochihito's capture and execution shortly afterwards. It was at this point that Minamoto no Yoritomo took over leadership of the Minamoto clan and began traveling the country seeking to rendezvous with allies. Leaving Izu Province and heading for the Hakone Pass, he was defeated by the Taira in the battle of Ishibashiyama. However he successfully made it to the provinces of Kai and Kōzuke, where the Takeda and other friendly families helped repel the Taira army. Meanwhile, Kiyomori, seeking vengeance against the Mii-dera monks and others, besieged Nara and burnt much of the city to the ground. Fighting continued the following year, 1181. Minamoto no Yukiie was defeated by a force led by Taira no Shigehira at the Battle of Sunomatagawa. However, the \"Taira could not follow up their victory.\" Taira no Kiyomori died from illness in the spring of 1181, and around the same time Japan began to suffer from a famine which was to last through the following year. The Taira moved to attack Minamoto no Yoshinaka, a cousin of Yoritomo who had raised forces in the north, but were unsuccessful. For nearly two years, the war ceased, only to resume in the spring of 1183.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"In 1183, the Taira loss at the Battle of Kurikara was so severe that they found themselves, several months later, under siege in Kyoto, with Yoshinaka approaching the city from the north and Yukiie from the east. Both Minamoto leaders had seen little or no opposition in marching to the capital and now forced the Taira to flee the city. Taira no Munemori, head of the clan since his father Kiyomori's death, led his army, along with the young Emperor Antoku and the Imperial regalia, to the west. The cloistered emperor Go-Shirakawa defected to Yoshinaka. Go-Shirakawa then issued a mandate for Yoshinaka to \"join with Yukiie in destroying Munemori and his army\". In 1183, Yoshinaka once again sought to gain control of the Minamoto clan by planning an attack on Yoritomo, while simultaneously pursuing the Taira westward. The Taira set up a temporary Court at Daaifu in Kyūshū, the southernmost of Japan's main islands. They were forced out soon afterwards by local revolts instigated by Go-Shirakawa, and moved their Court to Yashima. The Taira were successful in beating off an attack by Yoshinaka's pursuing forces at the Battle of Mizushima. Yoshinaka conspired with Yukiie to seize the capital and the Emperor, possibly even establishing a new Court in the north. However, Yukiie revealed these plans to the Emperor, who communicated them to Yoritomo. Betrayed by Yukiie, Yoshinaka took command of Kyoto and, at the beginning of 1184, set fire to the Hōjūjidono, taking the Emperor into custody. Minamoto no Yoshitsune arrived soon afterwards with his brother Noriyori and a considerable force, driving Yoshinaka from the city. After fighting his cousins at the bridge over the Uji, Yoshinaka made his final stand at Awazu, in Ōmi Province. He was defeated by Yoshitsune, and killed while attempting to flee.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"As the united Minamoto forces left Kyoto, the Taira began consolidating their position at a number of sites in and around the Inland Sea, which was their ancestral home territory. They received a number of missives from the Emperor offering that if they surrendered by the seventh day of the second month, the Minamoto could be persuaded to agree to a truce. This was a farce, as neither the Minamoto nor the Emperor had any intentions of waiting until the eighth day to attack. Nevertheless, this tactic offered the Emperor a chance to regain the Regalia and to distract the Taira leadership. The Minamoto army, led by Yoshitsune and Noriyori, made their first major assault at Ichi-no-Tani, one of the primary Taira camps on Honshū. The camp was attacked from two directions by Yoshitsune and Noriyori, and the Taira not killed or captured retreated to Yashima. However, the Minamoto were not prepared to assault Shikoku; a six-month pause thus ensued during which the Minamoto took the proper steps. Though on the retreat, the Taira enjoyed the distinct advantages of being in friendly, home territories, and of being far more adept at naval combat than their rivals. It was not until nearly a year after Ichi-no-Tani that the main Taira force at Yashima came under assault. Seeing Yoshitsune's bonfires in their rear, the Taira had not expected a land-based attack and took to their ships. This was a deceptive play on the part of the Minamoto, however. The Taira improvised imperial palace fell, and many escaped along with the Imperial regalia and the Emperor Antoku. The Genpei War came to an end one month later, following the battle of Dan-no-ura, one of the most famous and significant battles in Japanese history. The Minamoto engaged the Taira fleet in the Straits of Shimonoseki, a tiny body of water separating the islands of Honshū and Kyūshū. The tides played a powerful role in the development of the battle, granting the advantage first to the Taira, who were more experienced and abler sailors, and later to the Minamoto. The Minamoto advantage was considerably enhanced by the defection of Taguchi, a Shikoku warrior who went over to the Minamoto side in the middle of the action.

Sullivan has been the only continuous member of the band, which has seen numerous line-up changes in its 37-year history. Their music draws on influences across the musical spectrum, from punk and folk to soul, metal and classical. Sullivan’s lyrics, which range from directly political through to spiritual and personal, have always been considered as a key part of the band’s appeal. By the time they began making their first records in 1983, Robert Heaton, a former drum technician for Hawkwind, had replaced Tompkins. Whilst having their roots in punk rock, the band have always been difficult to categorise. In 1999, when asked about this, Sullivan said \"We've been labelled as punks, post-punks, Goth, metal, folk – the lot, but we've always been beyond those style confines\". Following a large turnover of personnel, both permanent and as touring members, as of August 2017 New Model Army comprise Sullivan, Dean White (keyboards and guitar), Michael Dean (drums), Marshall Gill (guitar) and Ceri Monger (bass).","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"The band were formed in Bradford, West Yorkshire in the autumn of 1980, taking their name from the army established by Parliament during the English Civil War, and played their first concert in Bradford in October, playing songs based on their shared love of punk rock and Northern soul. Until the mid-1980s, Sullivan used the alter ego of \"Slade the Leveller\" (Levellers being a radical political movement of the 1640s), supposedly so that he would not lose his unemployment benefits if the authorities realized he was making money from music. They continued to gig around the United Kingdom with little recognition, but in 1983 released their first singles \"Bittersweet\" and \"Great Expectations\" on Abstract Records, and were given airplay by Radio 1's John Peel. In February 1984, they were invited to play on popular music show The Tube, being introduced by presenter Muriel Gray as \"the ugliest band in rock and roll\". The producers of the show however were concerned about the lyrics of \"Vengeance\", which the band were due to perform (\"I believe in justice / I believe in vengeance / I believe in getting the bastards\") and so the band played \"Christian Militia\". Following this performance, the band's first mini-album Vengeance reached Number 1 in the UK independent chart in early 1984, pushing The Smiths from that position. After a further single \"The Price\" also reached a high placing in the independent charts, the band were signed by major label EMI.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"The band then made four studio albums (plus a live album) for EMI and one studio album for Epic, in a period of eight years. 1985's No Rest for the Wicked and associated single \"No Rest\" both made the mainstream Top 30 in the UK, the latter leading to some controversy when the band sported T-shirts with the phrase \"Only Stupid Bastards Use Heroin\" during an appearance on Top of the Pops. During the \"No Rest\" tour, Morrow left the band, and after some delay was replaced by 17-year-old Jason \"Moose\" Harris. However the band were refused work permits to enter the United States, as the US Immigration Department had said the band's work was of \"no artistic merit\". In December 1986 the band finally got permission to tour in the US. By this time The Ghost of Cain, produced by Glyn Johns, had been released, and was named best album of the year for 1986 in The Times by David Sinclair, who said that it \"was the best thing to happen to English rock music since the first Clash album\". Concerts included Reading Festival and a gig with David Bowie in front of the Reichstag in Berlin, and the band for the first time expanded their touring line-up to include a second guitarist in the shape of Ricky Warwick, as well as harmonica player Mark Feltham from Nine Below Zero. Thunder and Consolation was released in February 1989, and saw the band moving towards a more folk-rock sound, especially on the tracks including violinist Ed Alleyne-Johnson. Described as the band's \"landmark\" album, it reached No.20 in the UK charts, the singles \"Stupid Questions\" and \"Vagabonds\" made an impression in America and the band was able to tour the album there with Alleyne-Johnson also providing additional guitar and keyboards. At the end of the year however, Harris left the band, to be replaced by Peter \"Nelson\" Nice, who would play with the band for more than 20 years. 1990's Impurity, continued the folk-driven theme with Alleyne-Johnson still to the fore, and Adrian Portas joining the band on guitar. The next album was to be a musical change of direction; as Sullivan later said, \"just as this folk-cum-rave-cum-crusty-cum-new-age thing broke and became big in the early 1990s, we went – whoosh – done that – and went and made a very angry hard rock album\". The Love of Hopeless Causes, New Model Army's only release on Epic Records, appeared in 1993 and led with the single \"Here Comes the War\", which spawned controversy when it came packaged with instructions on how to construct a nuclear device.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"The band had previously decided to take a year out to concentrate on personal and other musical issues, and reconvened in late 1994 with Dean White, playing keyboards and guitar, replacing Alleyne-Johnson.

His life went in one direction and mine went in another\". It was agreed that they would go their separate ways after the forthcoming album and tour. Strange Brotherhood was released in May 1998 to unsurprisingly mixed reviews, but then Heaton was diagnosed with a brain tumour. He suggested that his drum technician Michael Dean take over from him to tour the album. By this time the band had formed their own independent label, Attack Attack, and former tour manager Tommy Tee had returned to manage the band. A live album \"...& Nobody Else\" followed in 1999, and eighth studio album Eight in 2000.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"After touring Eight, the band again took time out, most notably so that Sullivan could concentrate on his solo album Navigating by the Stars which was eventually released in 2003, and toured by Sullivan, Dean and White.

Carnival was finally released in September 2005, and includes Sullivan's reaction to Heaton's death, \"Fireworks Night\". Dave Blomberg was unable to take part in touring the album, and was replaced by current guitarist Marshall Gill. The band's tenth studio album, High, was produced relatively quickly and was released in August 2007. The tour suffered a slight setback when the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services again denied the band visas; this time the issue was relatively quickly resolved and the dates rescheduled for early 2008. Soon afterwards, the band was again shaken as manager Tommy Tee died unexpectedly at the age of 46. By 2009, though, the band were again back in the studio. Today Is a Good Day was a far more uncompromising album, the heavy rock title track and others directly referencing the stock market crash of 2008.

The final shows at the Kentish Town Forum in London were collected on a double CD and DVD release containing all 58 songs played over the nights of 3 and 4 December. After the band had played their traditional Christmas shows the following year, the news was released that Nelson had decided to leave the band for personal reasons, a decision that had been taken some time before. A few days later, on Christmas Eve, a fire destroyed the band's studio and rehearsal space in Bradford. Numerous guitars and other instruments were lost along with recording equipment and memorabilia. However, the studio was back in operation within three months, and after a number of auditions, Ceri Monger was announced as the band's new bassist and multi-instrumentalist. In 2013, the band's twelfth studio album, Between Dog and Wolf, mixed by Joe Barresi, was released and became the band's most successful since The Love of Hopeless Causes 20 years earlier. The album showed a marked shift away from the band's traditional sounds, including rhythms that were described as \"tribal\", though Sullivan claimed they were merely different ways of using drums – \"We really like complex tom-tom rhythms, we really like that pounding (beat)\". A year later, Between Wine and Blood was released, including six previously unreleased studio tracks from the Between Dog and Wolf sessions, along with eleven live tracks from that album.

His Latin name Ludovicus Sanctus (sometimes rendered as Santus) means Louis the Saint and is a literal translation of the Flemish name Lodewijk Heyligen.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Very little is known about the early life of Lodewijk Heyligen. It is believed he was born in Beringen. Beringen was located in the archdeaconry of Campine (in Flemish: Aartsdiakonaat Kempenland) which in turn was part of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. This is at the origin of Lodewijk's alternative names of Ludwig van Kempen and Louis van Campen. After studies at the Latin College in Beringen, he studied music at the abbey school of St. Laurent in Liège. After taking holy orders he traveled to the papal court in Avignon where he became linked to Cardinal Giovanni Colonna. He first became a cantor and later secretary to Colonna and was also the master of music at the Chapel of Colonna. He was further appointed cantor of the St. Donatian's Cathedral in Bruges in 1342. In a letter to the chapter of the St. Donatian's Cathedral dated 27 April 1348 the content of which has been partially preserved, Lodewijk Heyligen describes the horrors of the plague that was then raging in Europe. He ascribes the origin of the plague to calamitous events in India and the arrival in Genoa and later Marseille of merchant ships coming from the Orient. The letter recounts that half of the population of Avignon had died of the disease and that 11,000 of them had been buried in a new cemetery.

Their relationship can be traced back to the year 1330, when Petrarch was visiting bishop Giacomo Colonna in Lombez. There he became acquainted with Giacomo's brother cardinal Giovanni Colonna and his entourage of which Lodewijk Heyligen formed a part. They had the same age and became very close. Petrach wrote about 20 letters to Lodewijk which have been preserved. Petrarch alludes in his letters to the curious fact that Socrates is the only one of his good friends, who was not given to him by Italy, but instead by the Campine (Kempen). However, the letter continues, Socrates through his temperament, and especially his friendship with Petrarch himself, had almost become Italian himself. Petrarch refers to Lodewijk Heyligen as a very learned man, who was also distinguished by his musical gifts. Petrarch praises him for his elevated character and his loyal friendship. It is possible that Lodewijk Heyligen inspired in Petrarch the desire to visit the Southern Netherlands (present-day Belgium), a trip that the two friends may have taken together. In his letters to Lodewijk Heyligen, Petrarch often discloses his inner feelings. None of the letters that Lodewijk Heyligen wrote to Petrarch have been preserved. Yet it was through a letter from Lodewijk Heyligen that Petrarch received the news of the death of his beloved Laura, the muse of Petrarch's poetry. Lodewijk may have been present when she died. In the letter to which Petrarcha refers, Lodewijk assured Petrarch that when Laura died angels took her soul up into heaven. At Lodewijk's instance Petrarch edited a collection of his letters. Petrarch dedicated the collection entitled Epistolae de rebus familiaribus (Familiar Letters) to his friend referred to as Socrates. The death of Lodewijk Heyligen in 1361 affected Petrarch painfully. A note in his Virgil-codex reveals his sadness upon receiving the news of his death: \"Amisi comitem ac solatium meae vitae\" (I have lost my comrade and the solace of my life!). Petrarch also called up the memory of his friend in a passage in the ''Trionfo d'Amore (Triumph of Love, from Triumphs'') where he recognizes Socrates and Lelio (the literary nickname of Stefano Romano, a mutual friend of Petrarch and Lodewijk) amid the crowd, which is carried behind the chariot of Cupid: These words speak convincingly of the intimate friendship that Petrarch felt for Lodewijk.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Group A of the 1996 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Zone Group I was one of four pools in the Europe/Africa Zone Group I of the 1996 Fed Cup.

He then took a job in Lyon, where he met the poet Josephin Soulary, the curator of the library. Soulary helped him move to Paris, where despite being self-taught he wanted to become a journalist. At first he struggled to make a living. When the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) was declared he had to join the National Guard to avoid starvation. Bourde's first publication, under the pseudonym of \"Paul Delion\", was a violent attack on the members of the Commune and the Central Committee published by Alphonse Lemerre in 1871. By chance he met the chemist Marcellin Berthelot, who helped him get work at the Parisian newspaper Le Temps. In 1879 Le Temps chose him to accompany a parliamentary mission to Algeria. His account of this trip established his reputation as a journalist and a colonial publicist. In 1880 Bourde reported on the occupation of Tunisia, and then toured Europe. In 1885 he visited Bắc Ninh in Tonkin. Bourde traveled with the expedition of Francis Garnier in Tonkin as a reporter for Le Temps, and published De Paris au Tonkin in 1885. As the expedition passed through Port Said, Bourde sent a report describing it as a sleazy place where European prostitutes waited to fleece colonials who had made their fortunes in the east, rather than as a romantic oriental town. He was unimpressed by the Suez Canal, which he found monotonous despite the impressive statistics. He also asserted that the British preferred to travel by French ships to avoid the \"barbaric cooking of their compatriots.\" Many of his articles from these journeys were published in Le Temps. The 6 August 1885 issue of Le Temps carried a Bourde column, in which Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Verlaine were labeled \"decadent\" poets. He said there was nothing new in their movement, which was simply an exaggerated form of Romanticism. The poet Ernest Raynaud said that Bourde was the first to use the appellation \"décadent\", meaning it as a slur, but the term was readily accepted by its targets, who became known as the decadent movement.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"In 1890, after another visit to Tunisia, Bourde launched a campaign accusing the French government of neglecting its duties in Tunisia, where the local people were living in misery. He said that French colonists could show them good farming methods and the route to prosperity, progress and happiness. The government responded by appointing him to an administrative position in Tunisia, and made him Director of Agriculture when he arrived in Tunis. He became an effective administrator of both colonization and agriculture. Bourde learned from ancient accounts of the country and showed that fruit trees, particularly olives, could be grown in the semi-arid region south of Kairouan. He argued that central Tunisia had been a desert before the Roman invasion, and the Romans had introduced olive tree cultivation. In the 11th century the Arabs destroyed the trees in an attempt to convert the area to pasturage for a nomadic population, causing great damage. He found that, contrary to the opinions of archaeologists, milled stones found in many ruins were not steles commemorating local deities but were olive presses. Bourde revived agriculture in the neglected areas, by working with associations of European settlers and local people. He was a prolific author of reports on cultivation of cereals and fruit trees, sheep raising, locust invasions, cactus plantations and vineyards. Due to his success in Tunisia, Bourde was appointed Secretary General of Madagascar in 1895. He traveled to Madagascar in January 1896, but soon fell out with that island's Resident General, Hippolyte Laroche, who accused Bourde of trying to usurp his position. He left when the island was converted from a protectorate to a colony in January 1897.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Back in France in 1897, Bourde again became a regular contributor to Le Temps, and submitted articles for the remainder of his life. He was among the first to urge French intervention in Morocco, and regularly pushed for the methodical exploration of the Sahara. He continued to write on a range of philosophical and historical subjects, including the French Revolution. Paul Bourde died in Paris on 27 October 1914. A monument to Bourde was created by the Belgian sculptor Yvonne Serruys. It was unveiled in Sfax, Tunisia, by Resident General François Manceron on 13 April 1930 in a ceremony attended by many notable people. Bourde's and that of the geologist Philippe Thomas were thrown down and shattered on the night of 3–4 January 1957. The mayor of Voissant, Bourde's birthplace, managed to recover it and erect it in the heart of Voissant, where it stood until 1981. It was then replaced by a copy. The village of Néyrieu near Saint-Benoît, Ain, where Paul Bourde is buried, asked for the original. A local stonemason restored the bust, and it was put in place in the village in 1994.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Bourde's publications included:","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Bourde published three plays under the pseudonym Paul Anthelme:","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"In economics and finance, a holy grail distribution is a probability distribution with positive mean and right fat tail — a returns profile of a hypothetical investment vehicle that produces small returns centered on zero and occasionally exhibits outsized positive returns. The distribution of historical returns of most asset classes and investment managers is negatively skewed and exhibits fat left tail (abnormal negative returns). Asset classes tend to have strong negative returns when stock market crises take place. For example, in October 2008 stocks, most hedge funds, real estate and corporate bonds suffered strong downward price corrections. At the same time vehicles following the Holy Grail distribution such as US dollar (as a DXY index), treasury bonds and certain hedge fund strategies that bought credit default swaps (CDS) and other derivative instruments had strong positive returns. Market forces that pushed the first category of assets down pulled the latter category up.Protection of a diversified investment portfolio from market crashes (extreme events) can be achieved by using a tail risk parity approach, allocating a piece of the portfolio to a tail risk protection strategy, or to a strategy with Holy grail distribution of returns. A financial instrument or investment strategy that follows a Holy Grail distribution is a perfect hedge to an instrument that follows the Taleb distribution. When a \"Taleb\" investment vehicle suffers an unusual loss, a perfect hedge exhibits a strong return compensating for that loss (both outliers must take place at the same time). Practitioners tend to distinguish between a Holy Grail distribution and investment returns that are generated from an inverted Taleb distribution, a “minus-Taleb” distribution. The return series of the former has a positive meanwhile returns from the latter have a negative mean. For example, maintaining protection from market crashes by maintaining an exposure to an out-of-the-money put option on a market index follows a “minus-Taleb” distribution because options premiums have to be paid to maintain the position and options tend to expire worthless in most cases. When a market sells off strongly these options pay back and generate a strong positive outlier that “minus-Taleb” distribution features.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"* Financial risk","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Mohammed S.

At the start of the game, there are two story scenarios for the player to choose from: Root After and Root Before (denoted in game as √After and √Before, respectively; A and B for short). Each scenario is told from a different character's perspective in which the player assumes the role of; After has the player take on the role of Watase Kasasagi and Before has the player take on the role of Natsuhiko Tenkawa. Upon completion of both scenarios, Root Current (√Current; C for short) becomes available and upon completion of Current, Root Double (√Double; D for short) is unlocked. An essential component in the game is the \"Senses Sympathy System\" (\"SSS\"). Throughout the game, the player is given a chance to adjust their impressions (\"Senses\") of the characters (including the characters that they are taking the role of) using sliders. The SSS is based on the Enneagram of Personality, with each of the main characters of the story representing one of the nine different types. At scenes where the player is allowed to give their input - referred to as \"branches\" - the enneagram figure will show up on the screen; however, only characters that are relevant to the scene can have their Senses be adjusted. How the player interacts with the SSS at the branches directly influence the progress of the story. When the enneagram figure shows up, the color surrounding the outline of the graph signifies the importantance of the player's input. There are three different colors: blue, yellow, and red. Blue are branches that can influence a character's overall favor but are generally not important to the story; however, skipping too many blue branches can be detrimental later on. Yellow are branches that affect a character's actions and change how the story advances. Finally, red are branches in which deciding incorrectly will lead to an undesirable outcome, making the inputs at these branches critical. Each story scenario has multiple endings based on the results of the SSS up to certain points in the game.

Through the assistance of two of his squadmates - Kazami and Jun - and a hallucinatory voice he keeps hearing in his head, Watase progresses to gather information about himself and the situation. The three meet and rescue three other trapped civilians: Yuuri, Ena and Ukita. At a security room in LABO, the group of six learn that three other people (Natsuhiko's group) are also stuck in LABO. Watase's group decide to collaborate to search for the other party and find an escape route. Along the way, they encounter two murder scenes (one of a girl they had never seen before) and learn of a possibility that a terrorist group is in LABO. This forms a rift in the group where they believe one of them may be a potential terrorist and traitor, the most suspicious being Watase due to his amnesia. The distrust heightens when Yuuri disappears and Watase finds her dead near a staircase; at the security room, the group views the video footage recorded where Watase claims to have found Yuuri but the body does not appear in the video, leading Jun and Ukita to be skeptic of Watase and firmly believe him to be the traitor in the group. Watase escapes from the room and determines that the only way to save everyone is to head for the center of LABO where the nuclear reactor is located at (\"Area N\"). Upon entering Area N, expecting there to be a burning reactor, he finds a cold room with machines in it instead. Confused by the situation, he goes further in and finds Natsuhiko's body in critical condition.

Second, anytime the AD drug was administered, Natsuhiko lost his own senses; however, he regained his senses whenever the drug wore off or when Watase entered an area with high levels of radiation. Third, Natsuhiko was manipulating Watase's memories, fabricating and removing events in order to avoid looming threats; however, too much manipulation was fatal and could kill Watase (and subsequently, Natsuhiko) while at the same time, Watase slowly recovered back more of his old memories. Lastly, after connecting the information Watase had gathered, Natsuhiko deducted that LABO was not a nuclear research facility but a BC research facility instead and the AD medicine was actually a BC-power inhibitor, explaining his constant senses loss. Route D is the final route and alternates between Watase's perspective and Natsuhiko's. After Natsuhiko carries Watase to a nearby safe area and he regains consciousness, Natsuhiko hears Yuuri's telepathy voice where she tells him she is also a Communicator and is trapped at a hidden shelter in LABO. The two head for the shelter and rescue her; Natushiko then requests Watase to help him rescue Mashiro and Salyu. While Watase goes on the rescues, Natsuhiko gathers information about LABO from Yuuri who declares her death was a lie created by LABO; she also talks about LABO's secrets and has Natsuhiko go through her memories to learn about them and her past. With her information, Natsuhiko learns there were two test subjects in LABO: Yuuri and another girl who he believes was the one murdered. As Watase reports back of not being able to locate Salyu, he confronts Natsuhiko about his memory conflicts; though initially hesitant, Natsuhiko reveals to him the truth and, after Watase's request, agrees to restore back his old memories. Within his memories, Natsuhiko learns that Watase and Ukita joined Q and their mission was to capture the two test subjects confined in LABO to take back as proof of LABO's crimes; additionally, Natsuhiko learns the girl who was murdered is \"Subject N\" and finds out anyone who comes in contact with her BC power has their memories distorted with added malice, thus making the person go mad; finally, he learns there is a bomb placed that will go off when the lockdown lifts. Natushiko repairs and removes the malice from Watase's memories and Watase returns to normal. When asked to assist Yuuri and help her escape, he refuses due to him still feeling obligated to complete Q's mission; Yuuri contracts a deal with him and that she will go with him if he agrees to make sure everyone else escapes; Watase accepts. Through their partnership, Natsuhiko enters each person's memories and purifies them if necessary, turning everyone who was infected back to normal. In the control room, after hacking with the computers, they find that they can use the computers to temporarily open the bulkheads in the facility; however, at least three must stay behind in order to operate them thus only six can be saved. Believing there is still a method that can save them all, a series of visions suddenly flashes into everyone's minds; connected together, the visions reveal an escape route using the intake water pipe in the engine room which connects to the outside lake.

It was directed and produced by Takumi Nakazawa, and written by Team Tsukishima, which consists of Souki Tsukishima, Tora Tsukishima, and Moyashi Himukai, based on an original concept by Nakazawa; the writers were recruited and chosen through a competition. The music was composed by Takuma Sato. The main characters were designed by Mikeou, and the side characters by Wadapen and Narumi Ōtaka. Eco was the colorist and the supervisor for the creation of the event CGs. According to Nakazawa, the key concepts of the game are \"escape from a locked room\", \"lethal crisis\", \"suspect everything in an extreme situation\", \"near future sci-fi\", and \"group drama\". He cited the works of Christopher Nolan and J. J. Abrams as heavy influences on Root Double, mentioning Nolan's Memento and Inception, and Abrams' Fringe and Lost; another work that inspired him was the film The Poseidon Adventure. In early 2016, Nakazawa said that he had originally come up with the concept for the game around ten years prior. His concept was a story depicting two protagonists with opposing ideologies. At this point, the game was not an escape story; that element was added later to make the story more entertaining. He started with thinking of its twist, then its setting, its characters, and the story. As he developed the story, he made changes to the characters and setting. While Nakazawa's previous works focused on characters awaiting rescue from dangerous situations, he wanted to reverse that situation with Root Double; he wanted the protagonists to be in opposite situations, so he had one be involved in the rescuing and the other being rescued. The protagonists' differences were also reflected in their respective routes, with route A focusing on suspense and survival, and B focusing on mystery and drama. The route structures were made to be polar opposites, with A starting out thrilling, and with B gradually becoming more thrilling. Root Double was Souki Tsukishima's first work on a long \"novel game\"; he felt that he did not have much experience with this, so he put a lot of effort into writing the story. He found the first draft that he received to be interesting, but also thought that it would be hard to write; he took care in making sure his scenario matched up perfectly with Nakazawa's idea of the game's world. The story was written by Team Tsukishima, and was refined and revised over the course of several meetings. The game was first mentioned on a teaser site in December 2010, where it was called a \"new sci-fi suspense adventure\". In January 2011, Yeti announced the game, and said that they planned to release it in 2011. In March 2011, Yeti announced that they would not publicize the game, because of its themes and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami; development was put on hold, but in July 2011, Yeti revealed that it had been taken up again, and that it would be released for the Xbox 360. They had considered changing the background story of the game, but eventually decided to keep the story unchanged and follow their original plan, while also portraying the in-game disaster \"more carefully and conscientiously\". There had been some discussion about whether the game should be released or not, but the development team felt that it was important to portray how \"hope can be found even in the deepest despair\". Xtend Edition, an updated version of the game, which features a new ending, was developed for the PlayStation 3; according to Nakazawa, it felt necessary to make Xtend Edition to get more people to play the game. After Nakazawa heard English-speaking people ask on Facebook if the game would be available in English, he looked into it, finding that the English-speaking audience for visual novels had grown. He thought that the content of Root Double would be enjoyable for English-speakers, so it was decided that the game would be translated. At their panel at Anime Expo 2015, Sekai Project announced that they would localize Xtend Edition in a collaboration with Lemnisca Translations, and release it for Microsoft Windows. They launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter for the game in January 2016, with a goal of raising 135,000 USD. 53% of this would go to licensing, programming and porting, 27% to translation and editing, 10% to Kickstarter and card processing fees, and 10% to shipping fees. They also had three planned \"stretch goals\", allowing for the production of a fanbook and the translation of drama CDs based on the game if they manage to raise more than the goal. During the campaign, Sekai started examining the possibility of releasing the game for the PlayStation Vita; they announced that they had managed to get it approved by Sony, and that they would be able to release it for that platform. This required additional programming by Regista, as the PlayStation Vita version's engine needed to be reformatted to support the English script. The 135,000 USD goal was reached on February 2.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"In 2012, a demo was made available in which the player can play all the way to one of the game's endings.

She joined this field when she began her work as a faculty member at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research under James B. Murphy. Lynch was one of the first female scientists to study cancer. In the beginning, she studied mammary tumors in mice noting that some mice formed tumors more rapidly and spontaneously than others. She came to conclude that developing tumors was an inherited trait. Lynch also looked at tumors in the lungs of these mice, also coming to the conclusion that the tendency to accumulate tumors in both the mammary and lung tissue resulted from dominant inherited traits. Lynch's work was often doubted by other scientific experts during this time. Lynch is also given credit for pioneering her so-called albino Swiss mouse, which she used as test subjects for experiments. She actually brought back this albino Swiss mouse from Europe because it was easily bread in the laboratory. Lynch often bred the mice and distributed them to other laboratories for research.

In this study she looked at the importance of resistance for individuals related to the likelihood of attaining certain infectious diseases, and in this case specifically Yellow Fever. Some mice were more susceptible to diseases than others, and Lynch wanted to see how genetic factors influenced susceptibility to Yellow Fever Encephalitis. Lynch worked with Thomas P. Hughes, a fellow scientist in the field, and together they discovered that the sex of the mice did not determine susceptibility to Yellow Fever, offspring from two susceptible parents were more likely to be susceptible to Yellow Fever than offspring who only had resistant parent, and that overall there are hereditary factors present in mice that attribute to susceptibility to Yellow Fever.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Junction is a city in and the county seat of Kimble County, Texas, United States.

Junction is named for its location at the confluence of the North and South Llano Rivers.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"The community was founded in 1876 after the organization of Kimble County earlier that year. The original town site was named Denman after Marcellus Denman, who had surveyed and platted the new community. The name Denman was quickly changed to Junction City. In late 1876, Junction City won the designation of county seat from the unsuccessful and flood-prone settlement of Kimbleville. By 1879, a drugstore, livery stable, sawmill, and a few general stores were active in the community. Around 300 people were living in Junction City in 1882. The West Texas, Kimble County's first newspaper, began publishing in 1882. The county courthouse and its records were lost to a fire in 1884. A second, two-story brick stone courthouse was partially destroyed in an 1888 fire, but was repaired and remained in use until 1929, when the present courthouse was constructed. In 1894, Junction City became known simply as Junction. Infrastructure improvements marked the decade of the 1890s. Businessman Ernest Holekamp provided the city's first waterworks with a canal dug from the South Llano to Junction in 1895. A dam was built in 1896 on the South Llano River to provide power and water to the city and irrigation to surrounding lands. The population stood at 536 in 1900. Four Mile Dam, a more permanent and extensive dam, was completed in 1904. Junction continued to rapidly grow, with around 800 residents living in the community in 1910. That figure had grown to 1,250 by 1920. By the late 1920s, citizens felt the need for the benefits of a municipal government. On August 27, 1927, H.O. Denman and 152 others presented an incorporation petition to Kimble County Judge J.B. Randolph. In the election, 390 votes were cast: 274 (70%) \"For Incorporation\" and 116 (30%) \"Against Incorporation.\" A city officers' election took place on October 13, 1927, with Ernest Holekamp elected as Junction's first mayor. During the mid-1920s, highway connections from Junction to Menard and San Angelo were made available. A sewer system was built in 1929. In the 1930 census, the city recorded 1,415 residents. Junction was the chief shipping and commercial center of Kimble County, as well as a tourist resort and hunting center. A new municipal building and fire station were opened in 1939 and 1940, respectively. In the mid-1940s, the cedar-oil business enhanced the economy, but the city's growth slowed. Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, Junction's population continued to hover around 2,600.

Machado attended San Dieguito High School, and is known for his casual, \"laid-back\" style both in and out of the water taught. Though he rides a modern tri-fin shortboard, he is still considered a \"soul surfer\" largely because of his soft-spoken, humble personality and his disinterest in the spotlight, along with his fluid surfing style, which has earned him the nickname \"Mr. Smoothy.\" He is one of the best-known goofy-foot surfers in the world today. His style influences include Gerry Lopez, California's masters of style duo Oliver Lobdell and Taylor Lobdell, who he saw surfing on soft tops at River Jetties in 1990 and has tried to emulate their styles ever since. Rob has won many of pro surfing's most prestigious contests, including Hawaii's Pipeline Masters (Triple Crown of Surfing), and the U.S. Open of Surfing, the largest surfing event held on the U.S. mainland. His 2006 win in that competition was only his latest at Huntington Beach, and it came on the heels of his victory at the 2006 Monster Energy Pro (also held at Pipeline) on Oahu's North Shore. Also, Rob was on the \"West\" team that won the 2006 Summer X Games surfing competition, called \"The Game,\" held each year in Mexico. He is now retired from the WCT (World Championship Tour), but was among the top contenders until injuries began plaguing him in the past few years. Nevertheless, he's finished in the top three of the world in the year-end rankings twice. Since retiring, he has concentrated on a select few surfing competitions that are close to his heart. The surfing magazines and his videos and films keep him in the public eye. Rob hosts and participates in an annual event held at his home reef called the Rob Machado Surf Classic and Beach Fair, which is an amateur competition for the locals of all ages, and it includes demo sessions with Rob and other pros, as well as a lunchtime break when he talks with kids and gives them pointers. The competition crowns a King and Queen of the Reef for the best overall performances in a combination of surf-related events over the weekend. Currently, Rob is still frequently voted in surf magazine polls as readers' favorites, and has many sponsors, including Hurley, Reef, and Nixon. Machado is a very good friend of and served as an inspiration to quadriplegic surfer Jesse Billauer of the Life Rolls On Foundation. Just like Kelly Slater, he played \"himself\" in the 2007 animated picture, ''Surf's Up.'' Rob also starred in his own feature film released in the late 90s titled \"Drifting\". Additionally, Rob wrote and starred in the 2009 film, The Drifter. Machado was featured in Vogue magazine's summer issue (June 2010) with Blake Lively, in photographs which were taken in Cardiff and Encinitas, California. Machado is a 2011 inductee into the Surfing Walk of Fame in Huntington Beach, California in the surf champion category. Rob also had a pro-model INT soft board made for him after his experience at River Jetties in 2002. In 2013, Rob married his current wife Sophie Vilardo and the two now have a son together. In 2014, Rob re-signed with long-term sponsor Reef who subsequently released another 'Rob Machado signature model' sandal. During 2014, Rob once again showed his support for environmental causes by taking part in a project that uses recycled surfing foam to create surfboard blanks. Rob has often been outspoken about the impact surfboards have on our environment and this is another step taken toward not only increasing awareness among the general public, but by physically proving that if we use our creative minds there are alternatives out there to the wasteful process that takes place when making and shaping surfboards. In 2016 Rob will be collaborating with Firewire Surfboards (majority owned by Kelly Slater) to shape his own models. This comes off the back of his recent shaping experience with Machado creations boards. Machado's favorite wave is Cardiff Point, Uluwatu. His great-great grandfather, Agustin Machado, was an early Mexican settler in California and owned Rancho La Ballona, located in the present-day Westside region of Los Angeles County.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"* Official website","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Lost and Gone Forever is the third studio album by the band Guster, released in September 1999.

According to Goodwin, when he entered editor Stan Lee's office to apply for a job with Marvel, Lee was in the middle of writing an Iron Man story and handed him photostats of the pages he was working on for his writer's test. Goodwin speculated, \"I assume if he had been working on Sgt. Fury, I'd have been writing Sgt. Fury. Thank God he wasn't writing Millie the Model when I walked in.\" Goodwin and artist George Tuska co-created the supervillain the Controller in Iron Man #12 (April 1969). Luke Cage, the first African American superhero to star in an eponymous Marvel comic book series, was created by Goodwin and artist John Romita Sr. in June 1972. While briefly writing The Tomb of Dracula series, Goodwin and artist Gene Colan introduced the supporting character Rachel van Helsing. Goodwin co-created (with Marie Severin) the first Spider-Woman, as well as writing her first appearance in Marvel Spotlight #32 (February 1977). Goodwin also co-designed Marvel's New Universe line and created four of the eight series in the line. He explained, \"[Marvel editor-in-chief] Jim Shooter keeps saying of me: 'Well, here's this guy, in one meeting, he suddenly spews out half the ideas for the New Universe.' What that doesn't take into account is that for about five or six years I've had these half-formed notions and finally here is a situation where they would all fit in. ...it wasn't like I just went into the meeting and suddenly four concepts sprang full-blown from my brow.\"","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"In 1976, Goodwin replaced Gerry Conway to become the eighth editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics, with the understanding that it would only be temporary until a permanent replacement could be found. He ultimately resigned at the end of 1977 and was replaced by Jim Shooter. While Goodwin was editor-in-chief, Marvel secured the rights to publish the Star Wars film's comic adaptation and tie-in series, which then sold phenomenally well (helped by a dearth of other Star Wars merchandise at the time) at a point when the comics industry was in severe decline. Goodwin recalled about the Star Wars comic book, \"That really worked ... but I can't take any credit for it. Roy Thomas is the one who brought it to Marvel, and he had to push a little bit to get them to do it.\" He followed Thomas in adapting the Star Wars characters into an ongoing comic book with artist Carmine Infantino, as well as continuing the story (pre-Return of the Jedi) in a daily comic strip. Goodwin wrote the strips under his own name, although many websites and other sources erroneously claim he used the pseudonyms R.S. Helm and Russ Helm. Writer Mark Evanier corrected the matter by stating \"Archie did write the Star Wars comic strip (as well as other Star Wars material) but only under his own name. Russ Helm was a completely different person writing under his own name.\" During Goodwin and Infantino's tenure on Marvel's Star Wars series, it was one of the industry's top selling titles. He wrote comic book adaptations for Marvel of the two Star Wars sequels as well as other science-fiction films such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Blade Runner.

He said, 'Who's that?' 'Archie Goodwin.' The reason I didn't think we could get him is because he used to be my boss and I didn't know how he'd feel about coming back and me being his boss.\" Goodwin was at the time still working for Marvel as a writer, and Shooter recalls concocting a plan whereby the company \"pretended that Archie reported to Stan. In fact, I was doing all the paperwork and all the employee reviews and the budgets\" so that Goodwin could have the illusion of not working for his successor. In the autumn of 1979, Marschall was fired and Goodwin hired as Epic's editor. Shooter approached Goodwin after the moderate success of the Epic magazine and creator-owned graphic novels to produce a full-fledged line of creator-owned comics, Epic Comics. Goodwin initially balked at the additional workload, and Shooter turned the line over to Al Milgrom before Goodwin ultimately accepted editorship.

The concept of consideration has been adopted by other common law jurisdictions, including the US.Consideration can be anything of value (such as an goods, money, services, or promises of any of these), which each party gives as a quid pro quo to support their side of the bargain. Mutual promises constitute consideration for each other. If only one party offers consideration, the agreement is a \"bare promise\" and is unenforceable.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"According to Currie v Misa, consideration for a particular promise exists where some right, interest, profit or benefit accrues (or will accrue) to the promisor as a direct result of some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility that has been given, suffered or undertaken by the promisee. Forbearance to act amounts to consideration only if one is thereby surrendering a legal right. \"Past consideration is no consideration\": consideration must be \"executory\" or \"executed\", but not \"past\"; that is, consideration must be supplied in the present or in the future, but things done beforehand cannot be good consideration.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"For consideration to be good consideration, it must be of some value, even if it is minimal value. There is no requirement that the consideration be commensurate in economic terms to the original promise. Nominal consideration will suffice as good consideration for a contract, Courts will not measure the adequacy of the consideration as it is up to the parties to decide the subjective worth of each promise. *Chappell & Co Ltd v Nestle Co Ltd, Lord Somervell, \"''A contracting party can stipulate for what consideration he chooses. A peppercorn does not cease to be good consideration if it is established that the promisor does not like pepper and will throw away the corn.''\"","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"A promise cannot be based upon consideration that was said, given or done before the promise was performed. Something said afterwards, will not count as consideration. For example, if X promises to reward Y for an act that Y had already performed then while the performance of that act is good consideration, for the promise to be rewarded for it is past consideration and therefore not good consideration. In Eastwood v Kenyon the guardian of a young girl raised a loan to educate the girl and to improve her marriage prospects. After her marriage, her husband promised to pay off the loan. It was held that the guardian could not enforce the promise as taking out the loan to raise and educate the girl was past consideration, because it was completed before the husband promised to repay it. Furthermore, where a contract exists between two parties and one party, subsequent to formation, promises to confer an additional benefit on the other party to the contract, that promise is not binding because the promisee's consideration, which is his entry into the original contract, had already been completed (or \"used\") at the time the next promise is made. In Roscorla v Thomas, Roscorla had contracted to buy a horse from Thomas for £30. After the sale, Thomas promised Roscorla that the horse was sound; the horse turned out to be vicious. It was held that Roscorla could not enforce the promise, as the consideration given for entering into the contract to buy the horse had been completed by the time the promise was made; in a sense, the consideration was \"used up\".

For example, in the case of Tweddle v Atkinson, John Tweddle promised William Guy that he would pay a sum of money to the child of William Guy, and likewise William Guy promised John Tweddle that he would pay a sum of money to the child of John Tweddle, upon the marriage of the two children to each other. However, William Guy failed to pay the son of John Tweddle, who then sued his executors for the amount promised. It was held that the son could not enforce the promise made to his father, as he himself had not actually given consideration for it - it was his father who had done so instead. The son didn't receive any consideration, so he cannot enforce the promise. This particular rule of consideration forms the basis of the doctrine of privity of a contract, that is, only a party to a contract is permitted to sue upon that contract's terms. (Note that the doctrine of privity has been somewhat altered by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.) Therefore, consideration from the promisee was indulgent of the claim. Although consideration must move from the promisee, it does not necessarily have to move to the promisor. The promisee may provide consideration to a third party, if this is agreed at the time the parties contracted. The offeree must provide consideration, although the consideration does not have to flow to the offeror. For example, it is good consideration for person A to pay person C in return for services rendered by person B. If there are joint promisees, then consideration need only to move from one of the promisees.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"If the promisee provides what he was required by public law to do in any event in return for a promise, promised performance of existing duty is not good consideration. In Collins v Godefrey Godefrey promised to pay Collins for his giving of evidence. It was held that Collins could not enforce the promise as he was under a statutory duty to give evidence in any event. However, if the promisee provides more than what public duty imposes on him, then this is good consideration. In Ward v Byham a mother was under a statutory duty to look after her child. The ex-husband promised to pay her £1 a week if she ensured that the child was well looked after and happy. It was held that notwithstanding the statutory duty imposed on the mother, she could enforce the promise since the act of keeping the baby 'happy' provided additional consideration. Promising to perform a pre-existing duty owed to one's contracting party also fails to make good consideration. However this rule has been considerably narrowed by recent case law. The general rule is that if a creditor promises to discharge a debt in return for a fraction of payment, in paying the agreed fraction, the promisee is not providing consideration for the promise, as this is merely part performance of a contractual duty already owed. Consequently, the debtor is still liable for the whole amount, as he cannot force the promisor to accept less. A leading example is in Stilk v Myrick where Stilk, a seaman, agreed with Myrick to sail his boat to the Baltic Sea and back for £5 per month. During the voyage, two men deserted. Myrick promised he would increase Stilk's wages if Stilk agreed to honour his contract in light of the desertions. Stilk agreed and on return to port, Myrick refused to pay him the extra wages. It was held that Myrick's fresh promise was not enforceable as the consideration Stilk had provided for it, the performance of a duty he already owed to Myrick under contract, was not good consideration for Myrick's promise to increase his wages. Initially, there were only two exceptions to this rule:","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"However, the strictness of this rule was severely limited in Williams v Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd. The Roffey Brothers entered into a contract to refurbish a block of flats for a fixed price of £20,000. They sub-contracted carpentry work to Williams. It became apparent that Williams was threatened by financial difficulties and would not be able to complete his work on time. This would have breached a term in the main contract, incurring a penalty. Roffey Brothers offered to pay Williams an additional £575 for each flat completed. Williams continued to work on this basis, but soon it became apparent that Roffey Brothers were not going to pay the additional money. He ceased work and sued Roffey Brothers for the extra money, for the eight flats he had completed after the promise of additional payment. The Court of Appeal held that Roffey Brothers must pay Williams the extra money, as they had enjoyed practical benefits from the promise they had made to Williams. The benefits they received from it include: Having the work completed on time, not having to spend money and time seeking another carpenter and not having to pay the penalty. In the circumstances, these benefits were sufficient to provide consideration for the promise made to Williams of additional payment. It now seems that the performance of an existing duty may constitute consideration for a new promise, in the circumstances where no duress or fraud are found and where the practical benefits are to the promisor. The performance of an existing contractual duty owed to the promisor is not good consideration for a fresh promise given by the promisor. However, performance of an existing contractual duty owed to a third party can be good consideration, see further below. According to the Court of Appeal, it is unlikely that either avoiding a breach of contract with a third party, avoiding the trouble and expense of engaging a third party to carry out work or avoiding a penalty clause in a third party contract will be a \"practical benefit\". In Simon Container Machinery Ltd v Emba Machinery AB, the practical benefit was held to be the avoiding of a breach of contract, which was clearly not an extension of the principle. This is true unless the debtor provided fresh consideration for the promise. The following, mentioned in ''Pinnel's Case, and confirmed by Sibree v. Tripp'', may amount to fresh consideration: The Court of Appeal, in Re Selectmove Ltd, stated that the practical benefit doctrine, arising from Williams v Roffey, cannot be used as an additional exception to the rule. In that case, it was held that the doctrine only applies where the original promise was a promise to pay extra and not to pay less. It should be noted, however, that the Court of Appeal in Re Selectmove were unable to distinguish Foakes v Beer (a House of Lords decision), in order to apply Williams v Roffey (a Court of Appeal decision). It therefore remains to be seen whether the House of Lords would decide this point differently. In any event, the equitable principle of promissory estoppel may provide the debtor with relief. The Court of Appeal in June 2016 in  MWB v Rock Advertising revisited the issue of whether the practical benefit doctrine could be applied to decreasing pacts or agreements to accept less. Arden LJ and Kitchin LJ both endorsed this approach indicating that part payment along with practical benefit could be enough to support a promise to accept less. The decision has been criticised as extending the practical benefit test beyond its limits.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Consideration for a promise can be the performance of a contractual duty owed to someone other than the promisor. In Shadwell v Shadwell, Cayley Shadwell was under a contractual duty with a third party to marry. His uncle, Charles Shadwell promised to pay him £150 per year after he was married. It was held that Cayley Shadwell marrying was good consideration, notwithstanding that he was obliged by a contract with a third party to marry in any event.

When Bisutun gained the assistance of the Buyid Rukn al-Dawla the Samanid army left for Khurasan.

Bisutun's governor of Tabaristan, the Gilite Dubaj ibn Bani, supported the deceased ruler's young son, and could rely on Samanid support. Qabus gained the loyalty of the Ziyarid army, however, and received assistance from the Buyid 'Adud al-Dawla. Taking Gurgan from Dubaj, he captured Bisutun's son in Semnan. In 978 or 979 the caliph al-Ta'i granted Qabus the title ''Shams al-Ma'ali''. In 980 Qabus offered refuge to the Buyid ruler of Ray, Fakhr al-Dawla, who had recently fought a losing war with 'Adud al-Dawla. The latter offered the Ziyarid money and territory in exchange for the surrender of Fakhr al-Dawla, but Qabus refused. 'Adud then invaded and conquered Tabaristan; in 981 'Adud's brother Mu'ayyad al-Dawla took Gurgan. Qabus and Fakhr al-Dawla were forced to flee to Samanid Khurasan. The Samanids sent a force to take back the provinces, but were unsuccessful. In 984 Fakhr al-Dawla was able to recover his territories in Ray. Upon the advice of his vizier, however, he refused to give back Qabus control of Gurgan and Tabaristan. Qabus was forced to live in exile until 997, when Fakhr al-Dawla died and was succeeded by his young son Majd al-Dawla. Supporters of the Ziyarid gained control of Tabaristan and from there conquered Gurgan. Qabus returned there in 998. After a few Buyid attempts to expel him again failed. Although he formally recognized the caliph as his sovereign, Qabus ruled effectively as an independent ruler for the rest of his reign. He opened up relations with Mahmud of Ghazna, setting the stage for the eventual Ghaznavid takeover of the Ziyarids, while the Buyids did not undertake any more campaigns against him. Internal troubles, however, soon cost Qabus his position. His heavy-handed approach with officials in the army eventually caused a conspiracy to be formed against him. The army leaders failed to capture him in his castle outside Gurgan, but they took control of the capital and invited Qabus's son Manuchihr, the governor of Tabaristan, to take over. Manuchihr feared that he would lose the succession if he refused and joined the conspirators. He chased Qabus to Bistam, where the latter eventually agreed to abdicate. The conspirators then sent Qabus to a castle in Gorgan. While on the way to the castle, Qabus asked one of the rebels named Abdallah, about whom the perpetrator behind the conspiracy was. Abdallah responded by naming five generals who were the main heads behind the conspiracy, and also said that he was one of the men who played an important role in the conspiracy. He then blamed Qabus' cruelty as the reason for his downfall. Qabus agreed, and told Abdallah, that he should have ordered the execution of him and the other perpetrators before the conspiracy began. Qabus then arrived to the castle where he could spend the rest of his life in devotion. The conspirators, however, still considered him to be a threat and had him frozen to death in 1012. The tower of Gonbad Kavous was built for him as his tomb, and he is the subject of the Qabus nama, a major work of Persian literature from the eleventh century, which was written by his grandson Keikavus.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Family Law in Australia is contained in various pieces of legislation, but also includes the common law and laws of equity, which affect the family and the relationship between those people - including when those relationships end.

Although child protection is primarily dealt with on a state and territory basis, under state and territory legislation, parenting arrangements could also be dealt with under the federal Family Law Act 1975. A government-administered child support scheme enables parents to reach private agreements, or to register with the Child Support Agency Australia. The Child Support Agency may require one parent to make payments to the other, depending on the division of care and on each parent's income, among other factors. Since 1989 child support has been assessed under the Child Support (Assessment) Act, 1989, administered by Child Support Agency Australia.

The primary object of this law is to ensure that the courts always have the \"best interests of the child\" as the paramount consideration.

He is best known for the big band arrangements done for the Lou Rawls albums Black and Blue and Tobacco Road, as well as arrangements for several of Ray Charles' 1960s releases. He had his own big band for many years and recorded numerous tracks for Capitol Records, including two albums released under his own name. He later had a close relationship with the Duke Ellington orchestra, working as a pianist, arranger and conductor through the late 1960s and 1970s.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Onzy Durrett Matthews, Jr. was born on January 15, 1930 to Onzy Matthews and Leola Jones in Fort Worth, Texas. He grew up in Dallas until his early teens when his mother moved to Los Angeles seeking better paying work. His early exposure to music was through singing in a church gospel choir. Matthews knew early on he wanted to be a musician: \"music was his calling.\"  He graduated from high school early, at the age of 16, and primarily wanted to be a singer. \"I taught myself to accompany myself on piano and then I found out you had to have arrangements.\" In the early 1950s he enrolled in the Westlake College of Music in Hollywood and studied voice, ear training and harmony; much like Berklee School of Music they were proponents of the Schillinger System. He auditioned for band leader Les Brown as an arranger;  Brown helped Matthews focus on what to keep in an arrangement that works, and what to discard.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"In 1959 Matthews contacted Dexter Gordon who was prominent in the Los Angeles jazz scene at the time. Matthews' first big band was started with the help of Gordon and fellow saxophonist Curtis Amy. The group started with a book of 21 charts from Matthews, and rehearsed on Wednesday nights for 5 months until they finally booked gigs in the area. The group was a conglomerate of all-star Los Angeles jazz/studio artists who immediately took a liking to playing Matthews' inventive, blues-based orchestrations; the first players coming through his band included Gordon, Amy, Sonny Criss, Jack Sheldon, Carmell Jones, and Red Mitchell. Curtis Amy included two of Matthews' original tunes on his Pacific Jazz LPs ''Meetin' Here and Way Down'' in 1961 and 1962 respectively. Dexter Gordon recorded Matthews' original tune \"Very Saxily Yours\" for his ''Gettin' Around'' LP on Blue Note Records, but the track was not released until 25 years later on the CD re-issue. Matthews became known around Los Angeles as an adept arranger and musical director; his first professional arranging assignments came at this time with Lionel Hampton, Della Reese, Ruth Price, and Gene McDaniels. The first tune of Matthews to be commercially recorded was in 1956, when clarinetist Maurice Meunier, who had played with Lionel Hampton, recorded in France. Meunier had got a copy of Matthews' Blues for the Reverend through his association with the Hampton band the year before.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Much like other black jazz artists of that time such as Billy Eckstine and Nat King Cole, it was particularly difficult for Matthews to break prejudice and color barriers. He said at the time: \"They said the band was too mixed, a couple of whites or a couple of Negroes would be O.K. but not 50/50.\" He was confronted by an agent who hired an all-white group for a Las Vegas show rather than Matthews' mixed band. His frustration extended to A&R representatives for Decca, Columbia, and Capitol, who liked the sound of the band and his music but expressed concern after seeing the racially mixed band in person.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Matthews' group in the early 1960s was finding work as a big band in Los Angeles; most of his players were shared, alternating with Gerald Wilson's big band (another mixed race big band) every other weekend at the Metro Theatre in Los Angeles. The group also had a long running gig on Monday nights at the Virginia Club in Los Angeles. Players for Matthews' big bands and recordings in Los Angeles included Bud Brisbois, Curtis Amy, Bobby Bryant, Dick Hyde, Teddy Edwards, Earl Palmer, Jay Migliori, Conte Candoli, Richard 'Groove' Holmes, Horace Tapscott, Gabe Baltazar, Joe Maini, Ollie Mitchell, Herb Ellis, Carmell Jones, Sonny Criss, and Jack Nimitz. These included both black and white studio musicians, which presented a problem until Matthews signed to Capitol Records and worked with the much younger producer Nick Venet. Singers that Matthews featured and wrote for, on their regular live gigs, included Ruth Price, Jimmy Witherspoon, Big Miller, and June Eckstine.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Lou Rawls was signed to Capitol Records in early 1961 and finally had a breakthrough set of hits with Les McCann and the album Stormy Monday. Nick Venet was in charge of Rawls, and introduced him to Matthews. In August 1962 they recorded 13 new charts arranged by Matthews that featured Rawls' unique, resonating baritone voice. Eleven of those charts would comprise Rawls' LP Black and Blue, which charted for three weeks in Billboard from April 1963, reaching no.130. Both men were back in the studio at Capitol in July and August 1963 to record more tracks, which made up Rawls' album Tobacco Road.  Both albums were re-issued in 1969 on a Capitol release, Close-Up, which charted for three weeks in Billboard starting in August 1969, peaking at no.191. The band for the two Rawls LPs is essentially the personnel of the Onzy Matthews big band from that time. Matthews' arranging style was a perfect fit for Rawls, but the pair did not re-unite for any other releases for Capitol. Two other sets of singles sessions with Rawls from 1963 have never been issued. Matthews' band continued to back Lou Rawls on live concerts and events during the late 1960s. A second high-profile Matthews arranging assignment during this time was for Jac Holzman, who used him to arrange the traditional jazz ensemble tracks for Judy Henske's 1963 debut LP for Elektra Records. Matthews was finally signed to Capitol by Venet, and his first LP Non-Stop Jazz Samba was recorded in February 1963. However, the album was not released. It has three different instrumentations of ensembles, with his big band as the core. Matthews showed his adeptness at a wide range of writing; the tracks are somewhat like Quincy Jones' 1962 album Big Band Bossa Nova released by Mercury Records. There are other unissued jazz sessions that Matthews arranged from this time with Dupree Bolton for Pacific Jazz Records, and tracks with Richard 'Groove' Holmes recorded at Capitol. Later, Holmes had Matthews arrange all the tracks for his own release Book of Blues: Volume I in 1964 for Warner Bros. Records, backed by Matthews' big band. Matthews wrote more charts and supplied the same band on Holmes' November 1966 release A Bowl of Soul, also with Warner Bros. Records. In January 1964 Matthews recorded his first commercially released LP under his own name with Capitol: Blues with a Touch of Elegance. Though not a financial success, the LP is widely known by musicians and music critics as a masterpiece of jazz composing and arranging. The initial Billboard review was extremely positive putting it in the \"Jazz: Special Merit\" category. Lefty Louie/Blues Non-Stop, a quartet backed by voices, was also recorded during these sessions and was released as a single on the Capitol label. July 1964 saw the next Matthews' Capitol album recorded, ''Sounds of the '60s'', but it was not issued until spring 1966. The LP is not as cohesive a project as the first release and did not achieve the same fame as Blues With a Touch of Elegance. The initial Billboard review was quite positive, but did not help boost the sales of an LP that, by the time of its delayed release, was seen as passé. In October 1966 Matthews was assigned to write for Esther Phillips. His charts were recorded live in 1970, and appeared on the Atlantic release ''Confessin' the Blues'', one of Phillips' best recordings. The Phillips release has frequently been miscredited as having been recorded in 1976, due to its repackaging as a compilation; again Matthews' big band backs the primary artist. His other arranging assignments for recordings included work for Herb Alpert and Curtis Amy's 1965 LP The Sounds of Broadway/The Sounds of Hollywood for Palomar Records. He did some writing for Lloyd Price's big band and also the Jazz with Steve KTLA T.V. show from Los Angeles in 1963. From then on there were no more releases by Matthews as leader for Capitol or any other recording label; much was recorded with Capitol and finally released for the first time on the Mosaic Select 29 CD set in 2007. Matthews was known as a singer, but the only documentation of this is on the 2007 Mosaic set. Producer Michael Cuscuna found three tracks Matthews recorded during this era in July and October 1964, where he overdubbed his singing while fronting his big band. These had never been issued before the Mosaic set was produced. The Onzy Matthews big band was recorded far more on other artists' releases, primarily backing singers, than under his own name.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"During the mid-1960s Matthews was able to parlay his earlier arranging success into being offered numerous arranging assignments with singer Ray Charles. All these tracks were recorded for ABC-Paramount Records. March and June 1965 saw two arrangements of Matthews recorded on Charles' LP Country & Western meets Rhythm & Blues. He had one arrangement on the 1966 album ''Ray's Moods'', and three more on Charles' ''Cryin' Time''. Both these 1966 LPs were quite successful, and charted with Billboard. One last chart completed for Ray Charles was done for the single \"That's All I Am To You\". Matthews arrangement of ''Driftin' Blues on Cryin' Time'' is noted as a standout that features a guitar solo by Ray Crawford.

During a stop in New York City, he met Mercer Ellington and as a result became substitute at the piano for Duke Ellington, who was in failing health. He undertook several collaborations with the Duke Ellington Orchestra through the 1970s as an arranger. He co-wrote an unrecorded composition with Ellington, Just a Gentle Word from You Will Do.  After Duke Ellington's death in 1974 Matthews eventually had a disagreement with Mercer Ellington in 1979, and later had to settle a pay dispute with Ellington's son arising from Matthews' uncredited arrangements on the 1996 Musicmasters Records CD release Only God Can Make A Tree. During the 1970s Matthews arranged music on LPs for Earl Hines and Roy Ayers; he also worked on television music for Paul Anka. At that time he moved around between New York, Dallas and Seattle, and at one point worked for Sheraton Resorts in the Virgin Islands, Aruba, and Curaçao as solo pianist and singer. Disenchanted by much of the musical scene, in 1979 Matthews moved to Paris and started another jazz orchestra. Working from there as a composer, arranger, and actor, he appeared in the 1991 movie Dingo playing the trumpeter Caesar alongside Miles Davis. Matthews returned to New York in 1993 after a financially devastating prostate cancer operation. Mercer Ellington offered Matthews work on his father's Sacred Concert music as an arranger. Matthews also contributed string arrangements for Vanessa Rubin's ''I'm Glad There Is You'' album done for RCA Novus during this time. Prompted by his mother's death, in 1994 he moved back to Dallas to be with his father; his father died on May 26, 1995. Onzy Matthews had a last set of tours and concerts in Europe and Dallas, conducting his own music and that of Duke Ellington in 1996-97; an interview by the Dallas Observer three months before his death outlined his musical career. Matthews died at the age of 67 on November 13, 1997 in his Dallas apartment, of heart failure brought on by arteriosclerosis.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"In 2007 Michael Cuscuna produced a set of recordings for Mosaic documenting the music from Onzy Matthews' Capitol recordings. This set comprises the two albums he released with his big band plus all the other unissued material recorded at Capitol by Matthews with his band. The first LP, the bossa nova project from 1963, was not put on the market at the time, despite its writing and playing being equal to anything happening during that time in jazz and pop music. Matthews' big bands recorded much more on other artists' LPs than under his own name. He was in demand as an arranger for numerous singers, and the band had a level of success that translated into being a very good live \"club date\" band and \"studio\" orchestra. His music and his band never got a real opportunity to stand on its own. He was an important part of several different musical and cultural movements on the West Coast during the 1950s and 1960s. Matthews was part of the Central Avenue music scene in the 1950s and grew musically from interaction with important jazz musicians such as Lionel Hampton, Dexter Gordon, and Curtis Amy. He also trained at the Westlake College of Music with great composers and arrangers such as Bill Holman, Gary Peacock, Bob Cooper, and Bob Graettinger. Matthews is enigmatic and a hard person to pinpoint; in many ways he did not get nearly the credit he deserved in comparison with big band leaders or musical directors such as Oliver Nelson, Gerald Wilson, or Harold Wheeler.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Hugh Hughes (1790?–1863) was a Welsh painter, engraver and writer.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Born at Pwllygwichiad, near Llandudno, son of Thomas Hughes, by Jane, his wife, he was baptised at Llandudno, according to the parish register, 20 February 1790.

A radical in religion and politics, he signed a petition in favour of the passing of the Catholic Emancipation Bill about 1828.

Hughes denounced this act of intolerance in pamphlets and letters to Seren Gomer (1828–30). At a meeting of delegates of the Calvinistic Methodists held at Bala in 1831, a resolution was passed deprecating interference with the exercise of political rights. Hughes was not, however, reinstated as member of the denomination. After a time Hughes went over to the Independents, and later to the Plymouth Brethren.

She had one older sibling, Mary and six younger siblings: Ethel, Olive, Winifred, John, William and Kathleen. Samuel was a draper in Hokitika but in 1874 the family moved to Wellington. Samuel bought property in the city on Lambton Quay opposite the department store Kirkcaldie & Stains. He opened a draper shop downstairs and the family lived upstairs. The drapery business was successful, and the Alcorn children enjoyed a prosperous household with a governess and private schools. This life changed dramatically, however, in 1877 when a fire in the shop destroyed the business and killed a younger daughter of the family, Winifred, aged four. The family moved to Ashburton and the children attended school there.

Margaret started studying art and design at the Wellington Technical School, and also became the librarian there. In 1902 she won a class prize in design, and in 1903 she won the South Kensington National Book Prize in an art competition run from London. Alcorn's winning entry was of stencilling on fabric, a skill taught by Maud Kimbell, who became a life-long friend of Margaret's. In 1906, Alcorn and her sister Mary opened a shop in the new Kennedy Building on Lambton Quay, Wellington called \"Liberty's Wellington\", specialising in art furniture and furnishings, and started selling goods they imported themselves from Liberty department store in London. The sisters also offered professional advice and design ideas for their customers' homes. Margaret had a long involvement with the business of Arthur Riley, who had been the principal of the Wellington Technical College when she had studied there, and whose premises were also in the Kennedy Building. Margaret was Riley's company secretary, accountant and later a company director. Riley's importing business is still in operation: Arthur D. Riley & Co. Ltd.In the early 1920s the Alcorns' shop expanded into larger premises further along Lambton Quay, taking over Thomas Pringle's embroidery shop and business. At this time the Alcorns also hired a local artist and embroiderer, Marjory Mills, to design embroidery patterns for their shop. After Mary died in 1928, Margaret managed the shop alone, including opening a second shop in Burlington Arcade (pictured). The shops struggled to survive during the Great Depression and the business went into liquidation in 1934.

In July 1950, the School of Engineering separated from Dalian University and became Dalian Institute of Technology (大连工学院, DIT). Due to the rearrangement of the Ministry of Education to enhance development of education and construction of new born China, several departments, including Electrical Engineering, Physics and Law, were transferred to other universities and institutions. Meanwhile, scholars from other universities came to enlarge the departments of Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering. The university started to expand right after the rearrangement, attracting more scholars and funding. To ensure future growth, the then-headmaster, Bochuan Qu, strategically moved the university's main campus to the bay area of suburban Dalian. In October 1960, DIT became one of the 26 key national universities directly under the State Ministry of Education. Graduate School of DIT was established in April 1986. In March 1988, DIT changed its name into current Dalian University of Technology (DUT). DUT was a pioneer in China's MBA education. Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping's 1979 visit to the United States initiated hundreds of joint research projects and cooperative programs under the Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology. Among them, one is important in terms of influencing the development of China's MBA education. It is a cooperative management training agreement reached between the Chinese government and the United States's Department of Commerce in 1984, which resulted in a National Center for Industrial Science and Technology Management Development being established at the coastal city of Dalian. This Dalian-based program taught Chinese students MBA courses offered by State University of New York at Buffalo, complemented by subjects relating to China's enterprise management practice delivered by the then Dalian Institute of Technology. DUT experienced consistent growth of over half a century, and having gone through the persistent efforts of several generations, DUT has developed into a comprehensive university with a primary emphasis still on science and technology.

By the 1930s they were offering round the world passenger/cargo services, with the passenger fare on a freighter £100. Entirely on foreign service, the ships did not include UK ports of call. Managing owners were the S & J Thompson family. Most of their merchant ships bore the name Silver followed by the name of a tree. The Second World War claimed 11 of their ships. One of them, the Silverfir, was sunk by the German battleship on a voyage from Manchester to New York in 1941. Silver Line switched to tramping around the world in the 1950s, then went through several ownership changes, and by 1985, with the sale of their last ship, was no more. The Silverplane, a sleek twin funnel vessel of 7,226 gross tons built in 1948, was sold to the Cunard Line in 1951 and renamed Alsatia II, and so was her sister ship Silverbriar, to become Andria I. Their forward funnels were false, containing the chart room and the captain's cabin, looked like miniature s, and carried just 12 passengers, the maximum allowed without a regulation onboard doctor. They were sold to the Republic of China and renamed Union Freedom and Union Faith respectively. The latter ship was demolished in a fiery collision with an oil barge outside New Orleans in 1969, with considerable loss of life. An associated company, Joseph L. Thompson & Sons of Sunderland, was involved in the design of the first Liberty ships that saw service in World War II and beyond. During the 1970s, Silver Line had a fleet of chemical tankers carrying many types of (often hazardous) cargoes; from sulphuric acid to tetraethyllead. These ships often traded in the Baltic region. They were usually called Silver- plus the name of a bird of prey (e.g. Silvermerlin, Silverosprey, etc.). Promotion on these ships could be very rapid for those officers prepared to serve regularly on them. Captains of 25 years of age were not uncommon. The company also had bulk carriers, tankers, OBOs and general cargo ships.

He has lived in Madison, Wisconsin for over 40 years where he is well known for having brought baseball and world-renowned beers to that city. Janus was born in Washington, D.C. in 1945 and was graduated from Lake Forest College in 1968 with honors for his thesis on the dramaturgy of political demonstrations. He worked for a year as a community organizer with The West Side Organization and the Southern Christian Leadership Council in Chicago in 1966-67, where he was deeply influenced by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Eschewing an academic career, Janus became a city bus driver in Evanston, Illinois (“the second best job I ever had”) and later a dairy farmer (“the best job I ever had”) in Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin where he and his partners milked 30 cows and plowed, planted and harvested 250 acres. As he writes in his book, Creating Dairyland : :''I got mud, manure, and milk on my boots for the first time in 1973 when I became a novice dairyman on a thirty-acre farm in Crawford County. And although I no longer wear boots, that milk remains indelibly on my soul.'' Janus was a member of the Phoenix Fellowship, a group whose members were well known in Madison as the creators of the Ovens of Brittany and Bakers Rooms, restaurants that changed the landscape of food in Madison. In the early 1980s Janus led a group that brought professional, small town baseball back to Madison after an absence of 40 years. Madison Muskies Baseball became more than a game; it became a summertime outlet for community-based zaniness. So popular were the games and the zaniness, that CBS Nightly News, CNN and National Public Radio reported on them. While he served as the general manager of the Muskies, Janus was working on developing a small, local brewery. At the time (1983–84) there was a mere handful of new local breweries in the U.S. Janus and his partners decided to create authentic German beers such as might have been brewed in Wisconsin early in the century. They also wanted a brewery that paid homage to craftsmanship, individual taste and small-scale enterprise. Since micro-breweries were an unknown business at the time, investors did not know what to make of the idea. Janus and his partners decided that rather than raising money privately, they would go right to the beer drinking, brewery-loving people of Wisconsin. In a series of humorous radio and print advertisements and public meetings around Wisconsin, Janus and his partners were able to raise more than $1.5 million from state residents in a most unusual stock offering – an IPO connected only to a business plan, not an ongoing business. For his efforts, or chutzpah, Janus was nominated by the state securities commissioner for an Arthur Young Wisconsin Entrepreneur of the Year award. (He received an honorable mention.) Capital Brewery brewed its first beers in 1986. In 1998 it was named as the top brewery in the U.S. and seventh best in the world, at the Beverage Testing Institute's World Beer Championships in Chicago. In 1990, Janus began his career as an interviewer, writer and audio journalist. Since then he has interviewed hundreds of people on topics covering education policy, the environment, business, health and language. For example, a program on American dialects and another on the dark sky movement, aired around the world on Voice of America. Janus has also been heard on Marketplace, and thousands of CDs and websites. In 1999, Janus created You’re Not Alone: Conversations with Breast Cancer Survivors and Those Who Love Them, a first-person audio book which was awarded top honors by the Audio Publishers Association. In 2004, the German publishing company Langenscheidt, published Living in the U. S.: Das Praxistraining für Job und Alltag, a series of books and audio interviews with representative Americans created to help Germans understand everyday spoken American English. In 2006, Janus began to revisit dairy farming by producing a series of first-person audio stories of dairy farmers and cheesemakers for the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board. While working on these stories he realized that to tell the story of dairying today, he would also need to tell the remarkable story of how dairying came to Wisconsin and how it transformed the state. :''As I put each of these [audio] stories together, I was searching for ways to place them in a kind of “deeper soil,” a context or understanding that would examine not only what something was—a silo, for example— but also why it was, what problem it had solved and what changes it had wrought. I came to realize that the past is that deeper soil, that things planted in the past of Wisconsin dairying have grown into our landscape of today and our way of life.'' A book, Creating Dairyland, (Wisconsin Historical Society Press, 2011) came out of his exploration of this “deeper soil”; a book that shows how learning to care for cows saved Wisconsin farmers from themselves, transformed them into progressives, created an industry and bequeathed the endearing bucolic landscape to Wisconsin that continues to define the state’s psyche today. As he writes in the book’s introduction: :''Care of the cow has brought prosperity to Wisconsin. And in a very important way, I believe the dairy cow created Wisconsin—that is, created the Wisconsin we know and love today. For when we drive through Dairyland we take in a scene that truly defines us: the neat barns with their ranks of silos, the undulating green of grasses, and especially the cows, our avatars of contentment. All of this—our farms, their silos and cows; our farmers, their prosperity and their intelligence; all the fields of grass; and our remarkable history—make up what I like to call the book of Dairyland.'' During the 160 years since dairy cows began to reshape Wisconsin’s landscape, economics, moral ethic, and way of life, many thousands of men and women have been initiated into a kind of faith: faith that care of the cow and the soil would bring them prosperity, even happiness. Janus is exploring a number of new projects. The first, a book, tentatively called Bringing the Enlightenment to Main Street, will tell the story of how Free Masonry transduced the philosophy of the enlightened liberalism into a way of being and living for millions of American men; citizens of a new liberal-moral democracy. The second project under consideration is a one-man play called Marcus Aurelius Tonight, a reprise for the venerable Stoic.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Jayateerth Mevundi (Kannada: ಜಯತೀರ್ಥ ಮೇವುಂಡಿ) is a Hindustani classical vocalist of the Kirana Gharana.

After two years, he moved to another club in the community, Valencia CF, proceeding to score 33 La Liga goals during his first four seasons combined but suffering relegation in 1986. Subsequently, Roberto signed for FC Barcelona, netting ten times in 40 matches in his debut campaign, including a penalty in a 2–1 home win against Real Madrid, which won that year's league ahead of the Catalans. After being an essential unit as Barça won two vice-championships, two Copa del Rey trophies and the 1989 conquest of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, Roberto returned to Valencia in 1990. He helped the latter to two consecutive fourth-place finishes, and spent almost the entire 1993–94 on the sidelines due to injury. For the 1995–96 season, Roberto re-joined another familiar team, now Villarreal which competed in the second division. He scored once in 36 appearances in his third year to help them achieve a first-ever promotion, being immediately relegated afterwards; he retired in 2001 at almost 39, after two seasons in the second level with Córdoba CF. Subsequently, after more than 700 official games, Roberto moved into coaching, being in charge of lowly Valencia B, Orihuela CF and UD Alzira in his native region. In the 2004–05 campaign he was one of four managers for Córdoba, who finished in 19th position and dropped down to division three.

At this time, it was recognized that clearly the medical profession had an important role to play if the philosophy of the Health For All (HFA) movement in general and the European regional HFA targets in particular were to be achieved. Further meetings involving national medical associations, both from the West and East, took place in 1986, 1987 and 1988. At a meeting in Rome in 1990, the national medical associations recognised that they had created a permanent forum permitting a fruitful dialogue with WHO. This was formalized at Helsinki in 1991 when the aims of the Forum were finalized as follows: \"The aims of the Forum shall be, by establishing a dialogue and cooperation between National Medical Associations and the WHO Regional Office for the European Region, to:a) improve the quality of health and health care in Europe;b) promote the exchange of information and ideas between national medical associations, and between the associations and the World Health Organization;c) integrate appropriate aspects of policies of Health for All into basic, postgraduate and continuing medical education; andd) formulate consensus policy statements on health issues.\" For the purposes of membership, a national medical association is defined as a free independent nongovernmental association of physicians constituted in an organization, which elect its own officers, appoints its own staff and determines its own constitution, except for any statutory duties that it undertakes, and whose activities cover all the various aspects of professional practice. With the changes in the eastern part of the region during the 1990s, there was a need for special dialogue between the countries of the east of the region and those in the west. In Budapest (1994), London (1995) and Stockholm (1996) post-Forum meetings were held for the benefit of the newly emerging and re-establishing national medical associations from this part of the region. In 1997, this was merged with the main meeting and devoted to a discussion on health care reform, based on the 1996 WHO Ljubljana Charter on Reforming Health Care. In the annual meetings of the Forum, representatives from medical associations in around 40 countries are represented. Observers have included the Canadian Medical Association, which has attended regularly, and a number of Pan-European medical associations. Each year, national medical associations report not only on their general activities but also on any action they have taken in areas which the Forum has considered. A handbook is updated annually containing information about the constitution, activities and officers of participating national medical associations. From the beginning, the problems of tobacco and smoking and the subject of continuing medical education have been subjects of continuing report and action and, starting in Sofia in 1988, the quality of care. The meetings have considered a spectrum of subjects including AIDS, new patterns of infectious diseases, health care in the elderly, health promotion, the rights of patients, the physician’s role in environmental health, financing of health care, development of new health care systems, suicide in the young, quality of care development, use/misuse/abuse of drugs, medical education, health care in prisons, and eHealth. Over the years, the Forum has adopted a number of declarations, statements and recommendations. Some of these statements have been followed up by establishing action groups, notably in relation to tobacco and to the quality of care, in order to assist national medical associations in carrying forward appropriate action in their own countries.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"A meeting of the Forum is organized once a year (normally March or April), to review developments relevant to the medical profession and to exchange experience.

It is similar to Educational Testing Service (ETS) in the United States. NTS offers two main types of tests, the National Aptitude Test (NAT) and the Graduate Assessment Test (GAT). NAT is aimed at students seeking admission to colleges and universities. GAT is aimed at graduates seeking admission to postgraduate education. NTS exams are also used to determine qualifications of students seeking advanced study abroad. NTS is a Member of the International Association for Educational Assessment. It is also recognized by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan. The NTS was developed to ensure quality educational standards in Pakistan and to \"provide a national scale for comparative grading between institutes\", consolidating examination boards under one administrating body. According to Shahid Siddiqui, director of The Centre for Humanities and Social Sciences at the Lahore School of Economics, tests implemented prior to the development of the NTS were criticized as not accommodating socio-cultural differences, resulting in a need for \"an indigenous testing service that should design and develop testing materials within an indigenous context\". Prominent Pakistani institutions like COMSATS Institute of Information Technology (CIIT), Bahauddin Zakariya University (BZU), BUITEMS and Center for Advanced Studies in Engineering (CASE), The Islamia University of Bahawalpur (IUB) have made it compulsory for students seeking admission to have cleared tests conducted by NTS.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"Controversy erupted in 2007 following the mandating of NTS testing, first announced by Khalid Maqbool, Governor of Punjab, with regards to admission to universities and later set aside by the government unless the laws regarding university admission were amended.

Maqbool called for input from the vice-chancellors of Punjab's public universities on 4 June. That year, each university department was permitted to set its own entrance requirements, with six of 64 departments at Punjab University electing to utilize tests from NTS. In October 2007, the vice-chancellor of Punjab University, Muhammad Arif Butt, endorsed the use of NTS testing in all departments of the university.

A recent controversy of regular operational error has also arisen for Phd. assessment tests. The credibility / irresponsibility on the part of NTS officials has disqualified the candidates from applying in MPhil/PhD programs at public and private sector institutes because under HEC rules, they do not have any proof of clearing the test. The overall process lacks credibility & transparency due to the un-disclosed nature of alternative processes for any participants, when they do not fall in the norms of the operating procedure (i.e. errors / loop holes) due to complexities that arise from multifarious of socioeconomic nature of challenges in present-day environment of Pakistan.

Larian arrived to the United States alone in 1971 at the age of 17. After graduating from California State University, Los Angeles in civil engineering, he started an import-export business with his brother Fred in 1979 after his plans to return to Iran were ended by the 1979 Iranian Revolution. They then re-positioned the business into consumer electronics. In 1987, they became a distributor for Nintendo and in 1993, they became a licensee for the \"Power Rangers.\" In 1997, toys became their focus and they had their first internal success with the Singing Bouncy Baby. In 1998, he changed his company’s name to MGA Entertainment. In 2000, his brother sold his 45% stake in the company to Larian for $9 million and in 2001, MGA developed the \"Bratz\" doll. Two of the dolls bear the names of his children, son Cameron and daughter Jasmin (although her doll uses the Persian spelling Yasmin). In 2005, Bratz sales totaled $800 million well ahead of their main rival, Barbie with $445 million in sales. In 2004, Mattel sued MGA alleging that the designer of the Bratz doll had developed the concept while working for Mattel and that MGA had paid Mattel employees to work on MGA projects. MGA counter sued alleging that Mattel spied on its salesmen by masquerading as toy buyers, repositioned Bratz displays in retail stores to less favorable arrangements, and that Mattel paid retailers to favor Barbie over Bratz. On August 5, 2011 Mattel was also ordered to pay MGA $310 million for attorney fees, stealing trade secrets, and false claims. Due to a technical procedural issue having nothing to do with the merits of the claims, the Ninth circuit vacated without prejudice the $170 million portion of the judgment against Mattel for this misconduct. On January 13, 2014, MGA filed a complaint for these claims in State court in California seeking in excess of $1 billion and this lawsuit is currently pending. In November 2006, MGA purchased the manufacturer of infant and toddler toys, Little Tikes. In 2010, MGA released the highly successful \"Lalaloopsy\" doll. On March 21, 2018, Larian launched a GoFundMe campaign to acquire Toys \"R\" Us after news broke out of them declaring bankruptcy. Larian posted $200 million of his own money to get the campaign running, and a goal of $1 billion was set. According to the campaign description, all the money raised would be used in the formulation of a bid to acquire some of the company's assets throughout the bankruptcy process. The campaign has a deadline of May 28, 2018, Memorial Day. Any donations from supporters of the campaign would only be donations and would not result in donors receiving equity in any potential acquisition of the company. . Larian ultimately ditched the GoFundMe campaign after generating less than $60,000 by April 6th. On April 13th, Larian placed a bid of $890 million USD.

More specifically, the term refers to the design esthetic common to designers in the Netherlands. Dutch Design can be characterized as minimalist, experimental, innovative, quirky, and humorous. \"Dutch design is simple and powerful\", according to Hugo van den Bos, strategy director of Dutch graphic design studio Koeweiden Postma. Author and journalist Tracy Metz notes that, \"The Dutch have the ability to make fun of themselves. Also it's a matter of combining things that usually don't combine at all. Dutch designers are good in using materials that look worthless. The designers give them a new value.\" The Netherlands were primarily known for graphic design until the 1980s, when the term Dutch Design started to come into popular use. The term came to be closely identified with a group of Dutch product designers who have gained international recognization particularly from the 1990s onwards. These include Maarten Baas, Jurgen Bey, Richard Hutten, Hella Jongerius, Wieki Somers, Hester van Eeghen and Marcel Wanders, as well as internationally recognized design firms and collectives like Droog and Moooi which helped gain prominence for Dutch designers at major design events such as the Salone del Mobile in Milan. More broadly, the term could be extended to fashion designers such as Viktor & Rolf and architects such as Rem Koolhaas and Francine Houben. The emergence of an internationally recognized Dutch design scene has been fueled by a strong educational system for designers. The Design Academy Eindhoven has produced many well-known designers. In a 2003 article, the New York Times called it \"without question, currently the best design academy in the world.\" Another well-known school is Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam. A second contributing factor to the success of Dutch design is government support for new designers. Financial support from the Fonds BKVB (the Fund for Visual Arts, Design and Architecture), launched in 1988, has enabled design students to set themselves up as independent entrepreneurs right after graduation. Also playing an important role is the fact that design has become an integral part of product development in the Netherlands. Designers are included in the earliest phases of innovative processes and the production development cycle. The Dutch electronics company Philips, for instance, has around 450 people working on design at 12 offices around the world.

His mother, Louise Enders Brega, came from a wealthy Chicagoan family. In 1919, he attended Harrow School, where he met Evelyn Waugh, Francis Cyril Rose, and, most importantly, Cecil Beaton, with whom he formed a longstanding friendship. He was expelled from Harrow for a \"sexual escapade\". After that, James briefly studied music at the University of Bordeaux in France, before he was sent to Chicago to work. The utilities magnate Samuel Insull, a friend of the family, found him a position at the \"architectural design department\", where he acquired the mathematical skills that later enabled him to create the sophisticated gowns for which he was famous. At the age of nineteen, in 1926, James opened his first milliner shop in Chicago, using the name of \"Charles Boucheron\", as his disapproving father forbade him to use that of James.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"In 1928, he left Chicago for Long Island with 70 cents, a Pierce Arrow, and a number of hats as his only possessions. He later opened a millinery shop above a garage in Murray Hill, Queens, New York, beginning his first dress designs. At the time, he presented himself as a \"sartorial structural architect\". By 1930, he had designed, or \"shaped\" as he preferred to say, the spiral zipped dress and the taxi dress (\"so easy to wear it could be slipped on in the backseat of a taxi\"). From New York James moved to London, setting up shop in Mayfair. He designed the wedding dress for 'Baba' (Barbara) Beaton, Cecil Beaton's sister, for her marriage to Alec Hambro on November 6, 1934. James created a very modern interpretation of the white wedding dress, with a raised neckline and divided train. In 1936, he established the company Charles James (London) Ltd., using his own name officially for the first time. James also spent time in Paris in the early 1930s, working from the Hôtel Lancaster. He showed his first collection in the French capital in 1937. That same year, he created a one-of-a-kind white satin quilted jacket described by Salvador Dali as \"the first soft sculpture\", and now in the Victoria and Albert Museum collections. This jacket has been considered the starting point for \"anoraks, space man and even fur jackets\". In the 1930s, he also invented the Pavlovian waistband that expands after a meal. Meanwhile, he licensed his fashion designs with American department stores such as Lord & Taylor and Bergdorf Goodman.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"James moved permanently to New York in 1939, where he established Charles James, Inc. At the end of the Second World War, he designed a clothing line for Elizabeth Arden. In 1947, James showed one of his most successful collections in Paris. The following year, Millicent Rogers organized an exhibition of the outfits he made for her at the Brooklyn Museum, entitled A Decade of Design for Mrs Millicent H. Rogers by Charles James. Also in 1948, Cecil Beaton famously photographed eight of James creations for Vogue. James was at the height of his career in the early 1950s. At that time, he spent most of his time in New York at his 699 Madison Avenue workshop. Reaching the pinnacle of American fashion, he won two Coty Awards, in 1950 and 1954, and one Neiman Marcus Award in 1953. That year he conceived the \"Four-Leaf Clover\" or \"Abstract\" ballgown for the journalist Austine Hearst. It was the dress James ranked as his best creation. This dress weighed no less than 12 pounds and had to be supported by a rigid structure. James indeed had an iconoclastic approach to dressmaking. James looked upon his dresses as works of art, as did many of his customers. Year after year, he reworked original designs, ignoring the sacrosanct schedule of seasons. The components of the precisely constructed designs were interchangeable, so that James had a never-ending fund of ideas on which to draw. He is most famous for his sculpted ball gowns made of lavish fabrics and to exacting tailoring standards, but is also remembered for his capes and coats, often trimmed with fur and embroidery. After returning to New York City from Paris, Arnold Scaasi worked for James for two years. Scaasi was notably in charge of the ready-to-wear line. After he left, James dropped the line and returned to licensing special designs to American departments, which would produce and distribute them themselves. He designed the interior and several pieces of furniture for the Houston home of John and Dominique de Menil. Although his artistic perfectionism and bad temper led him to behave erratically, his clients went to great lengths to support him. James was more of an artist than of a businessman. He retired in 1958.","name":"English","natural":"English","classification":"en"},{"value":"In 1954, James married Nancy Lee Gregory, who was well-off, from Kansas, and 20 years his junior.

Daughter Louise was born in 1957; she was named for his mother. Their marriage dissolved in 1961. In 1964, he moved to the Hotel Chelsea, where he had three sixth-floor rooms for his work space, office, and apartment. There he maintained a coterie of devoted clients, friends, and admirers, and continued to work albeit in much reduced circumstances.

Cristóbal Balenciaga portrayed James as \"the only dressmaker who has raised [fashion] from an applied art to a pure art form\".

Her gift, along with the fashion collection of the museum, has since been transferred to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Several exhibitions celebrated James's contributions to fashion history. The Brooklyn Museum presented The Genius of Charles James from October 1982 to January 1983. The Chicago History Museum exhibited Charles James: Genius Deconstructed between October 2011 and April 2012. In 2014, James's work was the subject of the opening exhibition of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Anna Wintour Costume Center entitled Charles James: Beyond Fashion.
