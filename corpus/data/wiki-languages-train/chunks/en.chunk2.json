The line between middlegame and endgame is often not clear, and may occur gradually or with the quick exchange of a few pairs of pieces. The endgame, however, tends to have different characteristics from the middlegame, and the players have correspondingly different strategic concerns. In particular, pawns become more important as endgames often revolve around attempting to promote a pawn by advancing it to the eighth . The king, which has to be protected in the middlegame owing to the threat of checkmate, becomes a strong piece in the endgame. It can be brought to the center of the board and act as a useful attacking piece. Whereas chess opening theory changes frequently, giving way to middlegame positions that fall in and out of popularity, endgame theory always remains constant. Many people have composed endgame studies, endgame positions which are solved by finding a win for White when there is no obvious way to win, or a draw when it seems White must lose. Usually in the endgame, the stronger side (the one with more using the standard piece point count system) should try to exchange pieces (knights, bishops, rooks, and queens), while avoiding the exchange of pawns. This generally makes it easier to convert a material advantage into a won game. The defending side should strive for the opposite. Chess players classify endgames according to the type of pieces that remain.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Endgames can be divided into three categories:","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"An endgame is when there are only a few pieces left. There is no strict criterion for when an endgame begins, and different experts have different opinions . Alexander Alekhine said \"We cannot define when the middle game ends and the end-game starts\" . With the usual system for chess piece relative value, Speelman considers that endgames are positions in which each player has thirteen or fewer points in (not counting the king). Alternatively, an endgame is a position in which the king can be used actively, but there are some famous exceptions to that . Minev characterizes endgames as positions having four or fewer pieces other than kings and pawns . Some authors consider endgames to be positions without queens (e.g. Fine, 1952), while others consider a position to be an endgame when each player has less than a queen plus rook in material. Flear considers an endgame to be where each player has at most one piece (other than kings and pawns) and positions with more material where each player has at most two pieces to be \"Not Quite an Endgame\" (NQE), pronounced \"nuckie\" . Alburt and Krogius give three characteristics of an endgame: Mednis and Crouch address the question of what constitutes an endgame negatively. The game is still in the middlegame if middlegame elements still describe the position. The game is not in the endgame if these apply:","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"In endgames with pieces and pawns, an extra pawn is a winning advantage in 50 to 60 percent of cases. It becomes more decisive if the stronger side has a positional advantage . In general, the player with a advantage tries to exchange pieces and reach the endgame. In the endgame, the player with a material advantage should usually try to exchange pieces but avoid the exchange of pawns . There are some exceptions to this: (1) endings in which both sides have two rooks plus pawns – the player with more pawns has better winning chances if a pair of rooks are not exchanged, and (2) bishops on opposite color with other pieces – the stronger side should avoid exchanging the other pieces. Also when all of the pawns are on the same side of the board, often the stronger side must exchange pawns to try to create a passed pawn. In the endgame, it is usually better for the player with more pawns to avoid many pawn exchanges, because winning chances usually decrease as the number of pawns decreases. Also, endings with pawns on both sides of the board are much easier to win. A king and pawn endgame with an outside passed pawn should be a far easier win than a middlegame a rook ahead. With the recent growth of computer chess, an interesting development has been the creation of endgame databases which are tables of stored positions calculated by retrograde analysis (such a database is called an endgame tablebase). A program which incorporates knowledge from such a database is able to play perfect chess on reaching any position in the database. Max Euwe and Walter Meiden give these five generalizations:","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Many references have sections on basic, elementary, or fundamental checkmating endgames. In general, these are pawnless endgames with one or more pieces checkmating a lone king. For example: Two knights cannot force checkmate against a lone king (see Two knights endgame), but if the weaker side also has material (besides the king), checkmate is sometimes possible. The winning chances with two knights are insignificant except against a few pawns. () The procedure can be long and difficult. In competition, the fifty-move rule will often result in the game being drawn first. (While there is a board position that allows two knights to checkmate a lone king, such requires a careless move by the weaker side to execute.)","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"King and pawn endgames involve only kings and pawns on one or both sides. International Master Cecil Purdy said \"Pawn endings are to chess as putting is to golf.\" Any endgame with pieces and pawns has the possibility of  into a pawn ending . In king and pawn endings, an extra pawn is decisive in more than 90 percent of the cases . Getting a passed pawn is crucial (a passed pawn is one which does not have an opposing pawn on its file or on adjacent files on its way to promotion). Nimzovich once said that a passed pawn has a \"lust to expand\". An  is particularly deadly. The point of this is a decoy – while the defending king is preventing it from queening, the attacking king wins pawns on the other side. Opposition is an important technique that is used to gain an advantage. When two kings are in opposition, they are on the same (or ) with an empty square separating them. The player having the move loses the opposition. He must move his king and allow the opponent's king to advance. Note however that the opposition is a means to an end, which is penetration into the enemy position. If the attacker can penetrate without the opposition, he should do so. The tactics of triangulation and zugzwang as well as the theory of corresponding squares are often decisive. Unlike most positions, king and pawn endgames can usually be analyzed to a definite conclusion, given enough skill and time. An error in a king and pawn endgame almost always turns a win into a draw or a draw into a loss – there is little chance for recovery. Accuracy is most important in these endgames. There are three fundamental ideas in these endgames: opposition, triangulation, and the Réti manoeuvre .","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"This is one of the most basic endgames. A draw results if the defending king can reach the square in front of the pawn or the square in front of that (or capture the pawn) . If the attacking king can prevent that, the king will assist the pawn in being promoted to a queen or rook, and checkmate can be achieved. A is an exception because the king may not be able to get out of the way of its pawn. The other pawns are also exceptions (see diagram far right).","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Knight and pawn endgames feature clever manoeuvring by the knights to capture opponent pawns. While a knight is poor at chasing a passed pawn, it is the ideal piece to block a passed pawn. Knights cannot lose a tempo, so knight and pawn endgames have much in common with king and pawn endgames. As a result, Mikhail Botvinnik stated that “a knight ending is really a pawn ending.”","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"This is generally a draw since the knight can be sacrificed for the pawn, however, the king and knight must be covering squares in the pawn's path.

If Black plays the knight to any other square on move 2, White plays Kc8 anyway, threatening b7+ and promotion if the knight leaves the defense of the b7 square.

If the opposing bishops go on the same color of square, the mobility of the bishops is a crucial factor. A  is one that is hemmed in by pawns of its own color, and has the burden of defending them. The diagram on the right, from Molnar–Nagy, Hungary 1966, illustrates the concepts of good bishop versus bad bishop, opposition, zugzwang, and outside passed pawn. White wins with '''1. e6! (vacating e5 for his king) 1... Bxe6 2. Bc2! (threatening Bxg6) 2... Bf7 3. Be4! (threatening Bxc6) 3... Be8 4. Ke5!'''

Many players in a poor position have saved themselves from a loss by trading down to such an endgame. They are often drawn even when one side has a two-pawn advantage, since the weaker side can create a blockade on the squares which his bishop operates on. Interestingly, the weaker side should often try to make his bishop  by placing his pawns on the same color of his bishop in order to defend his remaining pawns, thereby creating an impregnable fortress.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Current theory is that bishops are better than knights about 60 percent of the time in the endgame. The more symmetrical the pawn structure, the better it is for the knight. The knight is best suited at an outpost in the center, particularly where it cannot easily be driven away, whereas the bishop is strongest when it can attack targets on both sides of the board or a series of squares of the same color . Fine and Benko give four conclusions:","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"This is a draw if the defending king is in front of the pawn or sufficiently close.

(In some cases, two extra pawns are not enough to win.) An extra pawn is harder to convert to a win in a rook and pawn endgame than any other type of endgame except a bishop endgame with bishops on opposite colors. Rook endings are probably the deepest and most well studied endgames. They are a common type of endgame in practice, occurring in about 10 percent of all games (including ones that do not reach an endgame) . These endgames occur frequently because rooks are often the last pieces to be exchanged. The ability to play these endgames well is a major factor distinguishing masters from amateurs . When both sides have two rooks and pawns, the stronger side usually has more winning chances than if each had only one rook . Three rules of thumb regarding rooks are worth noting:","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Generally (but not always), if the defending king can reach the queening square of the pawn the game is a draw (see Philidor position), otherwise the attacker usually wins (if it is not a rook pawn) (see Lucena position) . The winning procedure can be very difficult and some positions require up to sixty moves to win . If the attacking rook is two files from the pawn and the defending king is cut off on the other side, the attacker normally wins (with a few exceptions) . The rook and pawn versus rook is the most common of the \"piece and pawn versus piece\" endgames . The most difficult case of a rook and pawn versus a rook occurs when the attacking rook is one file over from the pawn and the defending king is cut off on the other side. Siegbert Tarrasch gave the following rules for this case: For a player defending against a pawn on the fifth or even sixth ranks to obtain a draw, even after his king has been forced off the queening square, the following conditions must obtain: The file on which the pawn stands divides the board into two unequal parts. The defending rook must stand in the longer part and give checks from the flank at the greatest possible distance from the attacking king. Nothing less than a distance of three files makes it possible for the rook to keep on giving check. Otherwise it would ultimately be attacked by the king. The defending king must stand on the smaller part of the board.

John Watson attributed to Tarrasch \"by legend\" and says that statistics do not support the statement . Benko wonders if it was due to Vasily Smyslov .

Three pawns are often enough to win against a minor piece, but two pawns rarely are. However, with rooks on the board, the bishop often outweighs the pawns. This is because the bishop defends against enemy rook attacks, while the bishop's own rook attacks enemy pawns and reduces the enemy rook to passivity. This relates to Rule 2 with rooks (above).

A bishop is especially valuable when there are pawns on both wings of the board, since it can intercept them quickly.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Endgame tablebases have made some minor corrections to historical endgame analysis, but they have made some more significant changes to endgame theory too.

Marc Bourzutschky found it using a program written by Yakov Konoval. Black's first move is 1... Rd7+ and White wins the rook in 517 moves. This was determined using the easier-to-calculate depth-to-conversion method, which assumes that the two sides are aiming respectively to reduce the game to a simpler won ending or to delay that conversion. Such endgames do not necessarily represent strictly optimal play from both sides, as Black may delay checkmate by allowing an earlier conversion or White may accelerate it by delaying a conversion (or not making one at all). In September 2009, it was found that the distance to mate (not conversion) in a similar position to the Bourzutschky–Konoval position was 545 (see diagram). The same researchers later confirmed that this (along with variations of it) is the longest 7-man pawnless endgame, and that, with pawns, the longest 7-man endgame is the one depicted in the second diagram. White takes 6 moves to promote the pawn to a Knight, after which it takes another 543 moves to win the game. The fifty-move rule is ignored in the calculation of these results and lengths, and as of 2014, they could never occur, because of the seventy-five move rule.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Endgames can be classified by the material on the board. The standard classification system lists each player's material, including the kings, in the following order: king, queen, bishops, knights, rooks, pawn. Each piece is designated by its algebraic symbol. For example, if White has a king and pawn, and Black has only a king, the endgame is classified KPK. If White has bishop and knight, and Black has a rook, the endgame is classified KBNKR. Note that KNBKR would be incorrect; bishops come before knights. In positions with two or more bishops on the board, a \"bishop signature\" may be added to clarify the relationship between the bishops. Two methods have been used. The informal method is to designate one color of squares as \"x\" and the other color as \"y\". An endgame of KBPKB can be written KBPKB x-y if the bishops are opposite-colored, or KBPKB x-x if the bishops are same-colored. The more formal method is to use a four digit suffix of the form abcd: In positions with one or more rooks on the board and where one or both players have one or both castling rights, a castling signature may be added to indicate which castling rights exist. The method is to use a one to four character suffix formed by omitting up to three characters from the string KQkq. Thus the endgame where White has bishop and rook and Black has a rook can be written KBRKR if no castling rights exist or KBRKR_Kq if White may castle on the king's side and Black may castle on the queen's side. In case the position also has two or more bishops the castling signature follows the bishop signature as in KBBNKRR_1100_kq. GBR code is an alternative method of endgame classification. The Encyclopedia of Chess Endings – ECE by Chess Informant had a different classification scheme, somewhat similar to the ECO codes, but it is not widely used. The full system is a 53-page index that was contained in the book The Best Endings of Capablanca and Fischer. The code starts with a letter representing the most powerful piece on the board, not counting kings. The order is queen, rook, bishop, knight, and then pawn. (Figurines are used to stand for the pieces.) Each of these has up to 100 subclassifications, for instance R00 through R99. The first digit is a code for the pieces. For instance, R0 contains all endgames with a rook versus pawns and a rook versus a lone king, R8 contains the double rook endgames, and R9 contains the endings with more than four pieces. The second digit is a classification for the number of pawns. For instance, R30 contains endgames with a rook versus a rook without pawns or with one pawn and R38 are rook versus rook endings in which one player has two extra pawns.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"The table below lists the most common endings in actual games by percentage (percentage of games, not percentage of endings; generally pawns go along with the pieces).","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"There are many books on endgames, see Chess endgame literature for a large list and the history.

A different form of the equation is sometimes used for certain types of materials, e.g. crystals. As an example, the coefficients for a common borosilicate crown glass known as BK7 are shown below: The Sellmeier coefficients for many common optical materials can be found in the online database of RefractiveIndex.info. For common optical glasses, the refractive index calculated with the three-term Sellmeier equation deviates from the actual refractive index by less than 5×10 −6 over the wavelengths' range of 365 nm to 2.3 µm, which is of the order of the homogeneity of a glass sample. Additional terms are sometimes added to make the calculation even more precise. In its most general form, the Sellmeier equation is given as with each term of the sum representing an absorption resonance of strength B i at a wavelength . For example, the coefficients for BK7 above correspond to two absorption resonances in the ultraviolet, and one in the mid-infrared region. Close to each absorption peak, the equation gives non-physical values of n 2 = ±∞, and in these wavelength regions a more precise model of dispersion such as Helmholtz's must be used. If all terms are specified for a material, at long wavelengths far from the absorption peaks the value of n tends to Here the coefficient A is an approximation of the short-wavelength (e.g., ultraviolet) absorption contributions to the refractive index at longer wavelengths.

He is also the founder and co-Artistic Director of the Bard Music Festival. He is a member of the Board of Directors of The After-School Corporation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to expanding educational opportunities for all students. Botstein also serves as the Board Chairman of the Central European University, a graduate-level, English-language university accredited in the United States and Hungary and located in Budapest. He is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Open Society Foundation . In July 2016, Austria’s Grafenegg Festival, a major international Austrian festival for classical music, appointed Botstein artistic director of the Grafenegg Campus and Academy, effective in 2018. Botstein is the author of Jefferson’s Children: Education and the Promise of American Culture and Judentum und Modernitaet. He graduated at age 16 from the High School of Music and Art in New York City, and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago and a Ph.D. from Harvard University in music history. He credits David Landes and Harold Farberman as his mentors. Botstein became the youngest (or possibly second youngest) college president in U.S. history at age 23, serving from 1970 to 1975 at the now-defunct Franconia College, after which he was named president of Bard College. As music director of the American Symphony Orchestra, Botstein emerged as a significant proponent of \"thematic programming,\" which attempts to assemble concert programs having a common theme grounded in literature, music history, or art. He also focused the ASO's programming on the performance of infrequently-performed works by major composers and the best examples of works by lesser-known composers, with a particular emphasis on U.S. premiere performances, many of which have been recorded by the ASO for the first time. In addition to the orchestra's main concert series at Carnegie Hall, Botstein inaugurated the Bard Music Festival with the participation of the ASO, a summer series which focuses on one composer each summer for an intensive series of concerts, lectures, and panel discussions. He also presents a series called \"Classics Declassified,\" devoting each program to a piece from the standard orchestral repertory. Botstein lectures about the piece for about an hour, using the orchestra to provide illustrations for his talk, then performs the entire piece, then opens the floor to questions from the audience directed at him and at members of the orchestra. This series, originally presented at Columbia University's Miller Theater, proved so popular that it was moved to Symphony Space for the 2007–2008 season. He also inaugurated an important series of recordings of neglected masterpieces with the Telarc label, using the ASO and a variety of European orchestras. In addition to his work with the ASO and JSO, Botstein has performed as a guest conductor with, among many others, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, New York City Opera, Los Angeles Philharmonic, BBC Symphony Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, and NDR Symphony Orchestra. The Los Angeles Times called 2013’s Los Angeles Philharmonic performance under Botstein “the all-around most compelling performance of anything I’ve heard all summer at the Bowl.” In fall 2013, Botstein also conducted the Sinfónica Juvenil de Caracas in Venezuela and Japan, making him the first non-Venezuelan conductor invited by El Sistema to conduct on a tour. Many live recordings of his performances, including the prestigious operas performed every summer during the Bard SummerScape festival, are widely available on compact disc and on Internet sites such as iTunes, Amazon, and Spotify. Botstein’s many books, essays, and articles on music and culture have earned him a reputation as a leading musicologist. His essays in the Princeton University Press series of books devoted to composers featured during the annual Bard Music Festival exemplify his efforts to address the complex social, political, and artistic influences and context of his subject. Of his recent essay in this series, on Jean Sibelius, the Times Literary Supplement wrote that Sibelius’s “critical reputation is epitomized by Leon Botstein.” He has also written extensively about music and culture in 19th-century Vienna, Jewish European culture, and modernism. His book Judentum und Modernität: Essays zur Rolle der Juden in der deutschen und österreichischen Kultur, 1848–1938 was written in German and has been translated into Russian. Botstein’s unique position as a leading music scholar, performer, and founder and coartistic director of the Bard Music Festival has enabled him to have an extraordinary impact on both music scholarship and performance. As the Wall Street Journal’s Barrymore Laurence Scherer observes, “the Bard Music Festival…no longer needs an introduction. Under the provocative guidance of the conductor-scholar Leon Botstein, it has long been one of the most intellectually stimulating of all American summer festivals and frequently is one of the most musically satisfying. Each year, through discussions by major scholars and illustrative concerts often programmed to overflowing, Bard audiences have investigated the oeuvre of a major composer in the context of the society, politics, literature, art and music of his times.” Leon Botstein is represented by Primavera Consulting.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Botstein is the brother of biologist David Botstein and husband of art historian Barbara Haskell.

With the purchase of the Montgomery Place estate to the south of the college in 2016, Bard’s campus consists of nearly 1,000 park-like acres in the Hudson River Valley. Botstein has greatly extended Bard’s reach internationally, leading the creation of new programs on several continents. In partnership with Saint Petersburg State University, Bard established in 1997 the first liberal arts college program in Russia, Smolny College, which offers dual degrees from Saint Petersburg State University and Bard. In 1998, the Institute for International Liberal Education (IILE)] was formed at Bard to advance the theory and practice of international liberal arts education. Bard’s other international programs include the Al-Quds Bard Partnership, a collaboration in Jerusalem between Bard College and Al-Quds University that was established in 2008 to improve the Palestinian education system; the International Human Rights Exchange (IHRE); the Program in International Education (PIE); Bard College Berlin: A Liberal Arts University; and joint programs with American University of Central Asia and Central European University. Botstein has also led Bard to become a regional and national leader in art and culture. In 1990, Bard opened the Center for Curatorial Studies and Art in Contemporary Culture, which includes the Hessel Museum of Art. In 1993, Bard opened the Bard Graduate Center: Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture in Manhattan. In 2003, the college opened the Frank Gehry-designed Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College, which houses two theaters, as well as dance and theater studios that provide rehearsal space for undergraduates. The Fisher Center is the home of the Bard Music Festival as well as Bard SummerScape, an annual festival of music, film, dance, and drama. In February 2009, Botstein was accused by Joel Kovel of terminating Kovel from his position as professor at Bard in retaliation for the latter's political views, an accusation which Botstein denied.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Botstein's written work includes ''Jefferson's Children: Education and the Promise of American Culture'', in which he argues that high school-level education after the tenth grade should be abolished in favor of a national early college system, as well as several other books in the fields of musicology and education.

A longtime community organization and nonprofit, Point Isabel Dog Owners and Friends (PIDO), is active in the maintenance and improvement of the park.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"This   park was incorporated into the East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) in 1975. The United States Postal Service operates a large bulk mail facility adjacent to what is now Point Isabel Regional Shoreline. As mitigation for the construction of this large facility on the shoreline, USPS offered to lease what is now Point Isabel Regional Shoreline free of charge to the EBRPD until 2025. The lease came with the condition of free public access. Originally 23 acres, Point Isabel officially added North Point Isabel (sometimes called Battery Point) in 2002 when McLaughlin Eastshore State Park (then Eastshore State Park) was created. North Point Isabel is across the narrow Hoffman Channel from Point Isabel and accessed via a short footbridge or from the Bay Trail. Both Point Isabel and North Point Isabel, like many parks along the East Bay shoreline, are landfill. For years North Point Isabel was a dumping ground for industrial waste—the \"Battery Point\" name referred to battery casings—and underwent an intensive cleanup and clay-capping operation in the 1980s. Two of the toxins of concern in the area were lead and zinc. The fenced-off area just north of the public restrooms at the Rydin Road end of the park is dirt that was dug more recently when the restrooms were installed. The dirt pile tested positive for high levels of contaminants and was fenced off, planted, and is permanently off-limits. The park is slated to undergo some trail and parking lot repaving in the second half of 2015. A few years ago it underwent some US $500,000 worth of capital improvements, including new irrigation systems and turf, fox tail removal, trail repavement, picnic sites and café seating. That was funded by a portion of US $225 million collected by Measure AA (1998). At some point in the future there are plans to possibly expand the seating at Mudpuppy's Tub and Scrub cafe. Park usage has increased exponentially from an estimated 500,000 human visitors in 2000 to more than 1,400,000 last year, according to EBRPD estimates. It is used heavily by people walking dogs but also by walkers, joggers, windsurfers, kayakers, photographers, birders, and picnickers. Point Isabel regularly makes the list of the top best places in the U.S. to walk dogs off-leash. It was named the number one dog park by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in 2006. It is named for the natural promontory of Point Isabel, which was itself named for landowner Víctor Castro's daughter Isabel. During the Gold Rush, the Castros operated a ferry from Point Isabel to send supplies from their ranch to San Francisco. For many years a pottery company, Tepco, operated near where the water treatment plant is today. Shards of broken pottery are still frequently found in the area, especially near where windsurfers clamber down to access the water. The remains of Laci Peterson washed up at Point Isabel in 2003, and those of her unborn son, Connor, were found a short distance north along the shoreline.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"The park is located along the eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay in the East Bay region of the Bay Area and is administered by the East Bay Regional Park District.

The northern shore of the park against Hoffman Channel was formerly a sandy beach and has been modified from its original state by leveling and in-filling of the surrounding mudflats, tidal flats and other wetlands. The rest of the peninsula consists of the Bay Trail, a water treatment facility, radio towers, a US Postal Service facility, a Costco store, and office buildings.

The great-granddaughter of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, king of Wales, Sibyl was also connected to the nobility of England and Normandy. Sibyl inherited the titles and lands of her father, Bernard de Neufmarché, Lord of Brecon, after her mother, Nest ferch Osbern, had declared her brother Mahel to have been illegitimate. Most of these estates passed to Sibyl's husband, Miles de Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford, as her dowry. Their marriage had been arranged personally by King Henry I of England in the spring of 1121. Sibyl, with her extensive lands, was central to the King's plans of consolidating Anglo-Norman power in south-east Wales by the merging of her estates with those of Miles, his loyal subject on whom he relied to implement Crown policy. As an adult, Sibyl lived through King Stephen's turbulent reign, known to history as the Anarchy, in which her husband played a pivotal role. Following Miles' accidental death in 1143, Sibyl entered a religious life at Llanthony Secunda Priory, Gloucestershire, England, which she had endowed up to six years previously. Sibyl is buried at the priory, founded by Miles in 1136.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Sibyl was born in about 1100 in Brecon Castle, Brecon, Wales, the only daughter of Marcher Lord Bernard de Neufmarché, Lord of Brecon, and Nest ferch Osbern. Nest was the daughter of Osbern FitzRichard and Nest ferch Gruffydd. Sybil's maternal great-grandparents were Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, king of Wales, and Ealdgyth (Edith of Mercia). Ealdgyth, the daughter of Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia, was briefly Queen consort of England by her second marriage to Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, who was killed at the Battle of Hastings. Sibyl's father, Bernard, was born at the castle of Le Neuf-Marché-en-Lions, on the frontier between Normandy and Beauvais. Bernard was a knight who had fought under English kings William I, William Rufus and Henry I. According to historian Lynn H Nelson, Bernard de Neufmarché was \"the first of the original conquerors of Wales\". He led the Norman army at the Battle of Brecon in 1093, during which Rhys ap Tewdwr was killed. Kingship in Wales ended with Rhys' death, and allowed Bernard to confirm his hold on Brycheiniog, becoming the first ruler of the lordship of Brecon. The title and lands would remain in his family's possession until 1521. The name Neufmarché, Novo Mercato in Latin, is anglicised into 'Newmarket' or 'Newmarch'.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Sibyl had two brothers, Philip, who most likely died young, and Mahel. Nest had Mahel disinherited by swearing to King Henry I of England that Mahel had been fathered by another man. According to Giraldus Cambrensis, this was done out of vengeance when Mahel had multilated Nest's lover, a knight whose identity is not disclosed. In the 19th century, Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward proposed that, after Bernard's death, Nest \"disgraced herself with an intrigue\" with one of his soldiers. Mahel, who had by this time inherited Bernard's estates, disapproved of the liaison to such an extent that he killed Nest's lover. Nest's revenge was to have Mahel disinherited by claiming that Bernard was not Mahel's father. The maritagium (marriage charter) arranged by King Henry I in 1121 for the marriage between Sibyl and her future husband Miles, however, makes it clear that Bernard was still alive when it was written; showing Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward's version of the story to diverge from the known facts. Author Jennifer C. Ward suggests that, although the marriage charter recorded that King Henry was acting at the request of Bernard, Nest, and the barons, it was probable he had put considerable pressure on the Neufmarchés to disinherit Mahel in favour of Sibyl and, thereby, Miles. Nevertheless, whatever the timing or reason, the outcome of Nest's declaration was that Sibyl (whom Nest acknowledged as Bernard's child) became the sole lawful heiress to the vast Lordship of Brecon, one of the most important and substantial fiefs in the Welsh Marches. Henry's maritagium referred specifically to Sibyl's parents' lands as \"comprising Talgarth, the forest of Ystradwy, the castle of Hay, the whole land of Brecknock, up to the boundaries of the land of Richard Fitz Pons, namely up to Brecon and Much Cowarne, a vill in England\"; the fees and services of several named individuals were also granted as part of the dowry. This made her suo jure Lady of Brecknock on her father's death, and one of the wealthiest heiresses in south Wales.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Sometime in April or May 1121, Sibyl married Miles (or Milo) FitzWalter de Gloucester, who on his father's death in 1129, became sheriff of Gloucester,  and Constable of England. The marriage was personally arranged by King Henry I, to whom Miles was a trusted royal official. A charter written in Latin (the maritagium), which dates to 10 April/29 May 1121, records the arrangements for the marriage of Sibyl and Miles. Historian C. Warren Hollister found the charter's wording telling, noting that \"the king gave the daughter as if he were making a grant of land\": \"Know that I  have given and firmly granted to Miles of Gloucester Sibyl, daughter of Bernard de Neufmarché, together with all the lands of Bernard her father and of her mother after their deaths … \". Her parents' lands would be conveyed to Miles after their deaths or earlier during \"their life if they so wish\". Henry also commanded that the fief's tenants were to pay Miles liege homage as their lord. By arranging a series of matrimonial alliances, similar to that between Sibyl and Miles, King Henry I of England transformed \"the map of territorial power in south-east Wales\". Such arrangements were mutually advantageous. Hollister describes Miles' marriage to Sibyl as having been a \"crucial breakthrough in his career\". The new lords, in similar positions to Miles, were the King's own loyal vassals, on whom he could rely to implement royal policy. Sibyl's father died sometime before 1128 (most probably in 1125), and Miles came into possession of her entire inheritance, which when merged with his own estates, formed one honour.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Together Sibyl and Miles had eight children:","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"After Henry I's death in 1135, the throne of England was seized by Stephen of Blois, a grandson of William I of England. Henry's daughter, Empress Matilda (Maud), also claimed the throne, and had the support of the Marcher Lords. On the death of her husband, the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V, in 1125, Matilda had returned to England for the first time in 16 years. At the insistence of her father, the barons (including Stephen) swore to uphold Matilda's rights as his heir. Matilda married Geoffrey of Anjou in 1128. They lived together in France, having three sons; the eldest of whom was to become King Henry II of England. Initially, Miles supported Stephen. In about 1136, Stephen granted Sibyl's husband the entire honour of Gloucester and Brecknock, and appointed him Constable of Gloucester Castle, whereby Miles became known as one of Stephen's \"henchmen\". Llanthony Priory had been established near Crucorney, in the Vale of Ewyas, in 1118; Wales' earliest Augustine monastery. Miles' father, Walter de Gloucester, had retired there by 1126. The unrest that had been simmering in Wales during the last years of Henry's reign, boiled over in 1135 on his death. The area around the priory returned to Welsh rule, coming under such “hostile molestation” from the Welsh that the non-Welsh canons decided to leave. Miles established a new Priory for them in Gloucester, England, which they called Llanthony Secunda, in 1136. Sometime after 1137, Sibyl, together with her husband, made a further endowment to Llanthony Secunda. Miles transferred his allegiance to Empress Matilda, on her return to England in 1139. According to Professor Edmund King, Miles' decision to support Matilda was guided by expediancy rather than principle, and the necessity of joining forces with Matilda's illegitimate half-brother, the powerful Robert, Earl of Gloucester, who was the overlord of some of Miles' fiefs. Stephen stripped Miles of the title 'Constable of England' in punishment for having deserted him. On 25 July 1141, in gratitude for his support and military assistance and, according to historian R.H.C. Davis, possibly to compensate Miles for having appeared to have lost the constableship, Matilda invested him as 1st Earl of Hereford. He also received St. Briavels Castle and the Forest of Dean. At the time Matilda was the de facto ruler of England, Stephen having been imprisoned at Bristol following his capture the previous February after the Battle of Lincoln. Sibyl was styled Countess of Hereford, until Miles' unexpected death over two years later. In 1141, Miles received the honour of Abergavenny from Brien FitzCount, the (likely illegitimate) son of Duke Alan IV of Brittany. This was in appreciation of the skilled military tactics Miles had deployed which had spared Brien's castle of Wallingford during King Stephen's besiegement in 1139/1140. Matilda gave her permission for the transfer. During the Anarchy, which the period of Stephen's reign as King of England was to become known, life was greatly disrupted in her husband's lands. Sibyl would have doubtless suffered as a result, especially after Miles' decision to support Matilda's claim to the throne and to oppose Stephen. When Matilda was defeated at Winchester in late 1141, Miles was compelled to return to Gloucester in disgrace: \"weary, half-naked and alone\". In November of that same year, Stephen was released from prison and restored to the English throne. Sibyl's distress would have been heightened in 1143 after the Bishop of Hereford, Robert de Bethune placed an interdict upon Hereford, blocked all the cathedral's entrances with thorns, and excommunicated Miles. In order to raise money to pay his troops and to assist Matilda financially, Miles had imposed a levy on all the churches in his earldom, an act which the bishop had regarded as unlawful. When the bishop protested and threatened Miles with excommunication, Miles in response, sent his men to plunder the diocese of its resources. In retaliation against Miles' earlier attacks on the royalist city of Worcester and the castles of Hereford and Wallingford, King Stephen bestowed the title \"Earl of Hereford\" on Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester; Miles, however, never surrendered the earldom nor the title to Robert de Beaumont.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"While on a deer-hunting expedition in his own Forest of Dean, Sibyl's husband was accidentally shot in the chest by an arrow which killed him on 24 December 1143.

In protest against his father's excommunication, Roger remained an outspoken enemy of the Church until close to the end of his life when he entered a Gloucester monastery as a monk. After her husband's death, Sibyl entered a religious life at Llanthony Secunda Priory, Gloucester, which she had previously endowed.

As her sons all died without legitimate offspring, Sibyl's three daughters became co-heirs to the Brecon honour, with Bertha, the second daughter, passing Sibyl's inheritance on (through marriage) to the de Braoses, thereby making them one of the most powerful families in the Welsh Marches. The Brecknock lordship would eventually go to the de Bohuns, by way of Eleanor de Braose. Eleanor, a descendant of Sibyl's through Bertha of Hereford, married Humphrey de Bohun, son of the 2nd Earl of Hereford. Eleanor and Humphrey's son, Humphrey de Bohun, succeeded his grandfather to the titles in 1275. Through the advantageous marriages of her daughters, Sibyl was an ancestress of many of England and Ireland's noblest families including among others, the de Bohuns, de Beauchamps, Mortimers, Fitzalans, de Burghs, de Lacys, and Bonvilles. Four of her descendants, Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford, Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster, Eleanor de Bohun, and Mary de Bohun married into the English royal family, while another, Anne Mortimer was the grandmother of Yorkist kings Edward IV and Richard III. By way of Edward's daughter, Elizabeth of York, every monarch of England and, subsequently, the United Kingdom, from Henry VIII up to and including Elizabeth II, descended from Sibyl de Neufmarché, as did the various royal sovereigns of Europe who shared a common descent from Mary, Queen of Scots.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Cerithiella laevis is a species of very small sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Newtoniellidae. .","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"* Engl W.

The Army classified the offering as a Category I proposal, meaning it is a well-conceived, scientifically or technically sound proposal pertinent to program goals and objectives with applicability to Army mission needs, offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff supporting resources required to achieve results. JMR-TD contracts were expected to be awarded in September 2013, with flights scheduled for 2017. On 9 September 2013, Bell announced it would team up with Lockheed Martin to develop the V-280. Lockheed will provide integrated avionics, sensors, and weapons to the aircraft. Additional partners were announced in the following months, including Moog Inc. for the flight control systems, GE Aviation for the engines, GKN for the tail structure, Spirit AeroSystems for the composite fuselage, Eaton Corporation as the distributor of hydraulics and power generation systems, and Astronics Advanced Electric Systems to design and manufacture power distribution systems. Israel Aerospace Industries, the first international partner recruited for the V-280, will supply the nacelle structures, and Textron sister company TRU Simulation & Training will build a high-fidelity marketing simulator and desktop maintenance trainer. On 2 October 2013, the U.S. Army awarded a technology investment agreement to Bell Helicopters for the V-280 Valor tiltrotor under the Joint Multi-Role program. Awards were also given to AVX Aircraft, Karem Aircraft, and a Sikorsky-Boeing team. JMR is not to develop a prototype for the next family of vehicles, but to develop technologies and interfaces. The TIAs give the four teams nine months to complete preliminary design of their rotorcraft, which the Army will then review and authorize the construction of two competing demonstrators to fly in 2017. While there is a potential for an early downselect, the four teams are focused on the 2017 flight demonstrations.

Expected maximum takeoff weight is around 30,000 lb. In one major difference from the earlier V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, the engines remain in place while the rotors and drive shafts tilt. A driveshaft runs through the straight wing, allowing both prop rotors to be driven by a single engine in the event of engine loss. The V-280 will have retractable landing gear, a triple-redundant fly by wire control system, and a V-tail configuration. The wings are made of a single section of Carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite, reducing weight and production costs. The V-280 will have a crew of 4 and be capable of transporting up to 14 troops. Dual cargo hooks will give it a lift capacity to carry a M777A2 Howitzer while flying at a speed of . The fuselage is visually similar to that of the UH-60 Black Hawk medium lift helicopter. When landed, the wing is in excess of seven feet from the ground, allowing soldiers to egress easily out of two wide side doors and door gunners to have wide fields of fire. Although the initial design is a utility configuration, Bell is also working on an attack configuration. Whether different variants of the V-280 would fill utility and attack roles or a single airframe could interchange payloads for either mission, Bell is confident the Valor tiltrotor platform can fulfill both duties; the U.S. Marine Corps is interested in having one aircraft to replace utility and attack helicopters, but the Army, which leads the program, is not committed to the idea and wants distinct platforms for each mission. Bell and Lockheed claim an AV-280 variant can launch rockets, missiles, and even small unmanned aerial vehicles forward or aft with no rotor interference, even in forward flight and cruise modes with the rotors forward. GE Aviation will manufacture the engines for the V-280, with the prototype (air vehicle concept demonstrator, or AVCD) using the General Electric T64. The specific engine for the model performance specification (MPS) is unknown, but has funding from the Army's future affordable turbine engine (FATE) program. The V-tail structure and ruddervators, made by GKN, will provide high levels of maneuverability and control to the airframe. It will be made of a combination of metals and composites. Features in the interior include seats that wirelessly charge troops’ radios, night-vision goggles, and other electronic gear and windows that display three-dimensional mission maps. Special emphasis has been placed on reducing the weight of the V-280 in comparison to the V-22, which in turn would reduce cost. To do this, composites are used extensively in the wing, fuselage, and tail. Wing skins and ribs are made of a honeycomb-stiffened \"sandwich\" construction with large-cell carbon cores for fewer, larger, and lighter parts. Skins and ribs are paste-bonded together to eliminate fasteners. With these measures, costs are reduced by over 30 percent compared to a scaled V-22 wing. Bell expects the V-280 to cost around the same as a AH-64E or MH-60M. While the Osprey has a higher disk loading and lower hover efficiency than a helicopter, the V-280 will have a lower disk loading and longer wing for greater hover and cruise efficiency.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Shah Bodaghlu (, also Romanized as Shāh Bodāghlū) is a village in Bastamlu Rural District, in the Central District of Khoda Afarin County, East Azerbaijan Province, Iran.

Its land borders were with India and Burma, with a coastline on the Bay of Bengal. East Pakistan was renamed from East Bengal by the One Unit scheme of Prime Minister Mohammad Ali of Bogra. The Constitution of Pakistan of 1956 replaced the British monarchy with an Islamic republic. Bengali politician H. S. Suhrawardy served as the Prime Minister of Pakistan between 1956 and 1957. A Bengali bureaucrat Iskandar Mirza became the first President of Pakistan. The 1958 Pakistani coup d'état brought general Ayub Khan to power. Khan replaced Mirza as president and launched a crackdown against pro-democracy leaders. Khan enacted the Constitution of Pakistan of 1962 which ended universal suffrage. By 1966, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman emerged as the preeminent opposition leader in Pakistan and launched the six point movement for autonomy and democracy. The 1969 uprising in East Pakistan contributed to Ayub Khan's overthrow. Another general, Yahya Khan, usurped the presidency and enacted martial law. In 1970, a major tropical cyclone struck East Pakistan, causing major casualties. In the same year, Yahya Khan organized Pakistan's first federal general election. The Awami League emerged as the single largest party, followed by the Pakistan Peoples Party. The military junta stalled in accepting the results, leading to civil disobedience, the Bangladesh Liberation War and the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. East Pakistan seceded with the help of India. The East Pakistan Provincial Assembly was the legislative body of the territory. Due to the strategic importance of East Pakistan, the Pakistani union was a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The economy of East Pakistan grew at an average of 2.6% between 1960 and 1965. The federal government invested more funds and foreign aid in West Pakistan, even though East Pakistan generated a major share of exports. However, President Ayub Khan did implement significant industrialization in East Pakistan. The Kaptai Dam was built in 1965. The Eastern Refinery was established in Chittagong. Dacca was declared as the second capital of Pakistan and planned as the home of the national parliament. The government recruited American architect Louis Kahn to design the national assembly complex in Dacca.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"In 1955, Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra implemented the One Unit scheme which merged the four western provinces into a single unit called West Pakistan while East Bengal was renamed as East Pakistan. Pakistan ended its dominion status and adopted a republican constitution in 1956, which proclaimed an Islamic republic. The populist leader H. S. Suhrawardy of East Pakistan was appointed as the Prime Minister of Pakistan. As soon as he became the prime minister, Suhrawardy initiated a legal work reviving the joint electorate system. There was a strong opposition and resentment to the joint electorate system in West Pakistan. The Muslim League had taken the cause to the public and began calling for implementation of separate electorate system. In contrast to West Pakistan, the joint electorate was highly popular in East Pakistan. The tug of war with the Muslim League to establish the appropriate electorate caused problems for his government. The constitutionally obliged National Finance Commission Program (NFC Program) was immediately suspended by Prime Minister Suhrawardy despite the reserves of the four provinces of the West Pakistan in 1956. Suhrawardy advocated for the USSR-based Five-Year Plans to centralize the national economy. In this view, the East Pakistan's economy was quickly centralized and all major economic planning shifted to West Pakistan. Efforts leading to centralizing the economy was met with great resistance in West Pakistan when the elite monopolist and the business community angrily refused to oblige to his policies. The business community in Karachi began its political struggle to undermine any attempts of financial distribution of the US$10 million ICA aid to the better part of the East Pakistan and to set up a consolidated national shipping corporation. In the financial cities of West Pakistan, such as Karachi, Lahore, Quetta, and Peshawar, there were series of major labour strikes against the economic policies of Suhrawardy supported by the elite business community and the private sector. Furthermore, in order to divert attention from the controversial One Unit Program, Prime Minister Suhrawardy tried to end the crises by calling a small group of investors to set up small business in the country. Despite many initiatives and holding off the NFC Award Program, Suhrawardy's political position and image deteriorated in the four provinces in West Pakistan. Many nationalist leaders and activists of the Muslim League were dismayed with the suspension of the constitutionally obliged NFC Program. His critics and Muslim League leaders observed that with the suspension of NFC Award Program, Suhrawardy tried to give more financial allocations, aids, grants, and opportunity to East-Pakistan than West Pakistan, including West Pakistan's four provinces. During the last days of his Prime ministerial years, Suhrawardy tried to remove the economic disparity between the Eastern and Western wings of the country but to no avail. He also tried unsuccessfully to alleviate the food shortage in the country. Suhrawardy strengthened relations with the United States by reinforcing Pakistani membership in the Central Treaty Organization and Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Suhrawardy also promoted relations with the People’s Republic of China. His contribution in formulating the 1956 constitution of Pakistan was substantial as he played a vital role in incorporating provisions for civil liberties and universal adult franchise in line with his adherence to parliamentary form of liberal democracy.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"In 1958, President Iskandar Mirza enacted martial law as part of a military coup by the Pakistan Army's chief Ayub Khan. Roughly after two weeks, President Mirza's relations with Pakistan Armed Forces deteriorated leading Army Commander General Ayub Khan relieving the president from his presidency and forcefully exiling President Mirza to the United Kingdom. General Ayub Khan justified his actions after appearing on national radio declaring that: \"the armed forces and the people demanded a clean break with the past...\". Until 1962, the martial law continued while Field Marshal Ayub Khan purged a number of politicians and civil servants from the government and replaced them with military officers. Ayub called his regime a \"revolution to clean up the mess of black marketing and corruption.\". Khan replaced Mirza as president and became the country’s strongman for eleven years. Martial law continued until 1962 when the government of Field Marshal Ayub Khan commissioned a constitutional bench under Chief Justice of Pakistan Muhammad Shahabuddin, composed of ten senior justices, each five from East Pakistan and five from West Pakistan. On 6 May 1961, the commission sent its draft to President Ayub Khan. He thoroughly examined the draft while consulting with his cabinet. In January 1962, the cabinet finally approved the text of the new constitution, promulgated by President Ayub Khan on 1 March 1962, which came into effect on 8 June 1962. Under the 1962 constitution, Pakistan became a presidential republic. Universal suffrage was abolished in favor of a system dubbed 'Basic Democracy'. Under the system, an electoral college would be responsible for electing the president and national assembly. The 1962 constitution created a gubernatorial system in West and East Pakistan. Each provinces ran their own separate provincial gubernatorial governments. The constitution defined a division of powers between the central government and the provinces. Fatima Jinnah received strong support in East Pakistan during her failed bid to unseat Ayub Khan in the 1965 presidential election. Dacca was declared as the second capital of Pakistan in 1962. It was designated as the legislative capital and Louis Kahn was tasked with designing a national assembly complex. Dacca's population increased in the 1960s.

Khan organized the Pakistani general election, 1970. The 1970 Bhola cyclone was one of the deadliest natural disasters of the 20th century. The cyclone claimed half a million lives. The disastrous effects of the cyclone caused huge resentment against the federal government. After a decade of military rule, East Pakistan was a hotbed of Bengali nationalism. There were open calls for self-determination. When the federal general election was held, the Awami League emerged as the single largest party in the Pakistani parliament. The League won 167 out of 169 seats in East Pakistan, thereby crossing the half way mark of 150 in the 300-seat National Assembly of Pakistan. In theory, this gave the League the right to form a government under the Westminster tradition. But the League failed to win a single seat in West Pakistan, where the Pakistan Peoples Party emerged as the single largest party with 81 seats. The military junta stalled the transfer of power and conducted prolonged negotiations with the League. A civil disobedience movement erupted across East Pakistan demanding the convening of parliament. Rahman announced a struggle for independence from Pakistan during a speech on 7 March 1971. Between 7–26 March, East Pakistan was virtually under the popular control of the Awami League. On Pakistan's Republic Day on 23 March 1971, the first flag of Bangladesh was hoisted in many East Pakistani households. The Pakistan Army launched a crackdown on 26 March, including Operation Searchlight and the 1971 Dhaka University massacre. This led to the Bangladeshi Declaration of Independence. As the Bangladesh Liberation War and the 1971 Bangladesh genocide continued for nine months, East Pakistani military units like the East Bengal Regiment and the East Pakistan Rifles defected to form the Bangladesh Forces. The Provisional Government of Bangladesh allied with neighboring India which intervened in the final two weeks of the war and secured the surrender of Pakistan.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"With Ayub Khan ousted from office in 1969, Commander of the Pakistani Army, General Yahya Khan became the country's second ruling chief martial law administrator. Both Bhutto and Mujib strongly disliked General Khan, but patiently endured him and his government as he had promised to hold an election in 1970. During this time, strong nationalistic sentiments in East Pakistan were perceived by the Pakistani Armed Forces and the central military government. Therefore, Khan and his military government wanted to divert the nationalistic threats and violence against non-East Pakistanis. The Eastern Military High Command was under constant pressure from the Awami League, and requested an active duty officer to control the command under such extreme pressure. The high flag rank officers, junior officers and many high command officers from the Pakistan's Armed Forces were highly cautious about their appointment in East-Pakistan, and the assignment of governing East Pakistan and appointment of an officer was considered highly difficult for the Pakistan High Military Command. East Pakistan's Armed Forces, under the military administrations of Major-General Muzaffaruddin and Lieutenant-General Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, used an excessive amount of show of military force to curb the uprising in the province. With such action, the situation became highly critical and civil control over the province slipped away from the government. On 24 March, dissatisfied with the performance of his generals, Yahya Khan removed General Muzaffaruddin and General Yaqub Khan from office on 1 September 1969. The appointment of a military administrator was considered quite difficult and challenging with the crisis continually deteriorating. Vice-Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan, Chief of Naval Staff of Pakistan Navy, had previously served as political and military adviser of East Pakistan to former President Ayub Khan. Having such a strong background in administration, and being an expert on East Pakistan affairs, General Yahya Khan appointed Vice-Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan as Martial Law Administrator, with absolute authority in his command. He was relieved as Chief of Naval Staff, and received extension from the government. On 1 September Admiral Ahsan assumed the command of the Eastern Military High Command, and became a unified commander of Pakistan Armed Forces in East Pakistan. Under his command, the Pakistani Armed Forces were removed from the cities and deployed along the border. The rate of violence in East Pakistan dropped, nearly coming to an end. Civil rule improved and stabilised in East Pakistan under Martial Law Administrator Admiral Ahsan's era. The tense relations between East and West Pakistan reached a climax in 1970 when the Awami League, the largest East Pakistani political party, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, (Mujib), won a landslide victory in the national elections in East Pakistan. The party won 160 of the 162 seats allotted to East Pakistan, and thus a majority of the 300 seats in the Parliament. This gave the Awami League the constitutional right to form a government without forming a coalition with any other party. Khan invited Mujib to Rawalpindi to take the charge of the office, and negotiations took place between the military government and the Awami Party. Bhutto was shocked with the results, and threatened his fellow Peoples Party members if they attended the inaugural session at the National Assembly, famously saying he would \"break the legs\" of any member of his party who dared enter and attend the session. However, fearing East Pakistani separatism, Bhutto demanded Mujib to form a coalition government. After a secret meeting held in Larkana, Mujib agreed to give Bhutto the office of presidency with Mujib as prime minister. General Yahya Khan and his military government were kept unaware of these developments and under pressure from his own military government, refused to allow Rahman to become the Prime Minister of Pakistan. This increased agitation for greater autonomy in East Pakistan. The Military Police arrested Mujib and Bhutto and placed them in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi. The news spread like a fire in both East and West Pakistan, and the struggle for independence began in East Pakistan. The senior high command officers in Pakistan Armed Forces, and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, began to pressure General Yahya Khan to take armed action against Mujib and his party. Bhutto later distanced himself from Yahya Khan after he was arrested by Military Police along with Mujib. Soon after the arrests, a high level meeting was chaired by Yahya Khan. During the meeting, high commanders of Pakistan Armed Forces unanimously recommended an armed and violent military action. East Pakistan's Martial Law Administrator Admiral Ahsan, unified commander of Eastern Military High Command (EMHC), and Air Marshal Mitty Masud, Commander of Eastern Air Force Command (EAFC), were the only officers to object to the plans. When it became obvious that a military action in East Pakistan was inevitable, Admiral Ahsan resigned from his position as martial law administrator in protest, and immediately flew back to Karachi, West Pakistan. Disheartened and isolated, Admiral Ahsan took early retirement from the Navy and quietly settled in Karachi. Once Operation Searchlight and Operation Barisal commenced, Air Marshal Masud flew to West Pakistan, and unlike Admiral Ahsan, tried to stop the violence in East Pakistan. When he failed in his attempts to meet General Yahya Khan, Masud too resigned from his position as Commander of Eastern Air Command, and took retirement from Air Force. Lieutenant-General Sahabzada Yaqub Khan was sent into East Pakistan in emergency, following a major blow of the resignation of Vice Admiral Ahsan. General Yaqub temporarily assumed the control of the province, as he was made the unified commander of Pakistan Armed Forces. General Yaqub mobilised the entire major forces in East Pakistan, and were re-deployed in East Pakistan. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman made a declaration of independence at Dacca on 26 March 1971. All major Awami League leaders including elected leaders of National Assembly and Provincial Assembly fled to neighbouring India and an exile government was formed headed by Mujibur Rahman. While he was in Pakistan Prison, Syed Nazrul Islam was the acting president with Tazuddin Ahmed as the prime minister. The exile government took oath on 17 April 1971 at Mujib Nagar, within East Pakistan territory of Kustia district and formally formed the government. Colonel MOG Osmani was appointed the Commander in Chief of Liberation Forces and whole East Pakistan was divided into eleven sectors headed by eleven sector commanders. All sector commanders were Bengali officers who had defected from the Pakistan Army. This started the Bangladesh Liberation War in which the freedom fighters, joined in December 1971 by 400,000 Indian soldiers, faced the Pakistani Armed Forces of 365,000 plus Paramilitary and collaborationist forces. An additional approximately 25,000 ill-equipped civilian volunteers and police forces also sided with the Pakistan Armed Forces. Bloody guerrilla warfare ensued in East Pakistan. The Pakistan Armed Forces were unable to counter such threats. Poorly trained and inexperienced in guerrilla tactics, Pakistan Armed Forces and their assets were defeated by the Bangladesh Liberation Forces. On April 1971, Lieutenant-General Tikka Khan succeeded General Yaqub Khan as Commander of unified forces. General Tikka Khan led the massive violent and massacre campaigns in the region. He is held responsible for killing hundreds of thousands of Bengali people in East Pakistan, mostly civilians and unarmed peoples. For his role, General Tikka Khan gained the title as \"Butcher of Bengal\". General Khan faced an international reaction against Pakistan, and therefore, General Tikka was removed as Commander of Eastern front. He installed a civilian administration under Abdul Motaleb Malik on 31 August 1971, which proved to be ineffective. However, during the meeting, with no high officers willing to assume the command of East Pakistan, Lieutenant-General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi volunteered for the command of East Pakistan. Inexperienced and the large magnitude of this assignment, the government sent Vice-Admiral Mohammad Shariff as second-in-command of General Niazi. Admiral Shariff served as the deputy unified commander of Pakistan Armed Forces in East Pakistan. However, General Niazi proved to be a failure and ineffective ruler. Therefore, General Niazi and Air Marshal Enamul Haque, Commander of Eastern Air Force Command (EAFC), failed to launch any operation in East Pakistan against Indian or its allies. Except Admiral Shariff who continued to press pressure on Indian Navy until the end of the conflict. Admiral Shariff's effective plans made it nearly impossible for Indian Navy to land its naval forces on the shores of East Pakistan. The Indian Navy was unable to land forces in East Pakistan and the Pakistan Navy was still offering resistance. The Indian Army, entered East Pakistan from all three directions of the province. The Indian Navy then decided to wait near the Bay of Bengal until the Army reached the shore. The Indian Air Force dismantled the capability of Pakistan Air Force in East Pakistan. Air Marshal Enamul Haque, Commander of Eastern Air Force Command (EAFC), failed to offer any serious resistance to the actions of the Indian Air Force. For most part of the war, the IAF enjoyed complete dominance in the skies over East Pakistan. On 16 December 1971, the Pakistan Armed Forces surrendered to the joint liberation forces of Mukti Bahini and the Indian army, headed by Lieutenant-General Jagjit Singh Arora, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the Eastern Command of the Indian Army. Lieutenant General AAK Niazi, the last unified commander of Pakistan Armed Forces' Eastern Military High Command, signed the Instrument of Surrender at about 4:31 pm. Over 93,000 personnel, including Lt. General Niazi and Admiral Shariff, were taken as prisoners of war. On 16 December 1971, East Pakistan was liberated from Pakistan as the newly independent state of Bangladesh. The Eastern Military High Command, civilian institutions and paramilitary forces were disbanded.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"In contrast to the desert and rugged mountainous terrain of West Pakistan, East Pakistan featured the world's largest delta, 700 rivers and tropical hilly jungles.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"East Pakistan inherited districts from British Bengal.

The Adamjee Jute Mills was the largest jute processing plant in history and its location in Narayanganj was nicknamed the Dundee of the East. The Adamjees were descendants of Sir Haji Adamjee Dawood, who made his fortune in British Burma. Natural gas was discovered in the northeastern part of East Pakistan in 1955 by the Burmah Oil Company. Industrial use of natural gas began in 1959. The Shell Oil Company and Pakistan Petroleum tapped 7 gas fields in the 1960s. The industrial seaport city of Chittagong hosted the headquarters of Burmah Eastern and Pakistan National Oil. Iran, an erstwhile leading oil producer, assisted in establishing the Eastern Refinery in Chittagong. The Comilla Model of the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development (present-day Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development) was conceived by Akhtar Hameed Khan and replicated in many developing countries. In 1965, Pakistan implemented the Kaptai Dam hydroelectric project in the southeastern part of East Pakistan with American assistance. It was the sole hydroelectric dam in East Pakistan. The project was controversial for displacing over 40,000 indigenous people from the area. The centrally located metropolis Dacca witnessed significant urban growth.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Although East Pakistan had a larger population, West Pakistan dominated the divided country politically and received more money from the common budget. According to the World Bank, there was much economic discrimination against East Pakistan, including higher government spending on West Pakistan, financial transfers from East to West and the use of the East's foreign exchange surpluses to finance the West's imports. The discrimination occurred despite fact that East Pakistan generated a major share of Pakistan's exports. The annual rate of growth of the gross domestic product per capita was 4.4% in the West Pakistan versus 2.6% in East Pakistan from 1960 to 1965. Bengali politicians pushed for more autonomy, arguing that much of Pakistan's export earnings were generated in East Pakistan from the exportation of Bengali jute and tea. As late as 1960, approximately 70% of Pakistan's export earnings originated in East Pakistan, although this percentage declined as international demand for jute dwindled. By the mid-1960s, East Pakistan was accounting for less than 60% of the nation's export earnings, and by the time Bangladesh gained its independence in 1971, this percentage had dipped below 50%. In 1966, Mujib demanded that separate foreign exchange accounts be kept and that separate trade offices be opened overseas. By the mid-1960s, West Pakistan was benefiting from Ayub's \"Decade of Progress\" with its successful green revolution in wheat and from the expansion of markets for West Pakistani textiles, while East Pakistan's standard of living remained at an abysmally low level. Bengalis were also upset that West Pakistan, the seat of the national government, received more foreign aid. Economists in East Pakistan argued of a \"Two Economies Theory\" within Pakistan itself, which was founded on the Two Nation Theory with India. The so-called Two Economies Theory suggested that East and West Pakistan had different economic features which should not be regulated by a federal government in Islamabad.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"East Pakistan was home to 55% of Pakistan's population.

They largely followed the religions of Buddhism, Christianity and Hinduism. East Pakistan was home to immigrant Muslims from across the Indian subcontinent, including West Bengal, Bihar, Gujarat, the Northwest Frontier Province, Assam, Orissa, the Punjab and Kerala. A small Armenian and Jewish minority resided in East Pakistan. The Asiatic Society of Pakistan was founded in Old Dacca by Ahmad Hasan Dani in 1948. The Varendra Research Museum in Rajshahi was an important center of research on the Indus Valley Civilization. The Bangla Academy was established in 1954. Among East Pakistan's newspapers, The Daily Ittefaq was the leading Bengali language title; while Holiday was a leading English title. At the time of partition, East Bengal had 80 cinemas. The first movie produced in East Pakistan was The Face and the Mask in 1955. Pakistan Television established its second studio in Dacca after Lahore in 1965. Runa Laila was Pakistan's first pop star and became popular in India as well. Shabnam was a leading actress from East Pakistan. Feroza Begum was a leading exponent of Bengali classical Nazrul geeti. Jasimuddin and Abbasuddin Ahmed promoted Bengali folk music. Munier Chowdhury, Syed Mujtaba Ali, Nurul Momen, Sufia Kamal and Shamsur Rahman were among the leading literary figures in East Pakistan.

These two battalions boasted only five rifle companies between them (an infantry battalion normally had 5 companies). This weak brigade was under the command of Brigadier-General Ayub Khan (local rank Major-General – GOC of 14th Army Division), together with the East Pakistan Rifles, which was tasked with defending East Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947. The PAF, Marines, and the Navy had little presence in the region. Only one PAF combatant squadron, No. 14 Squadron Tail Choppers, was active in East Pakistan. This combatant squadron was commanded by Air Force Major Parvaiz Mehdi Qureshi, who later became a four-star general. The East Pakistan military personnel were trained in combat diving, demolitions, and guerrilla/anti-guerrilla tactics by the advisers from the Special Service Group (Navy) who were also charged with intelligence data collection and management cycle. The East Pakistan Navy had only one active-duty combatant destroyer, the PNS Sylhet; one submarine Ghazi (which was repeatedly deployed in West); four gunboats, inadequate to function in deep water. The joint special operations were managed and undertaken by the Naval Special Service Group (SSG(N)) who were assisted by the army, air force and marines unit. The entire service, the Marines were deployed in East Pakistan, initially tasked with conducting exercises and combat operations in riverine areas and at near shoreline. The small directorate of Naval Intelligence (while the headquarters and personnel, facilities, and directions were coordinated by West) had vital role in directing special and reconnaissance missions, and intelligence gathering, also was charged with taking reasonable actions to slow down the Indian threat. The armed forces of East Pakistan also consisted the paramilitary organisation, the Razakars from the intelligence unit of the ISI's Covert Action Division (CAD).

Prime Minister Amin invited then-President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the Pakistan Peoples Party to take control of Pakistan. In a color ceremony where, Bhutto gave a daring speech to the nation on national television. At the ceremony, Bhutto waved his fist in the air and pledged to his nation to never again allow the surrender of his country like what happened with East Pakistan. He launched and orchestrated the large-scale atomic bomb project in 1972. In memorial of East Pakistan, the East-Pakistan diaspora in Pakistan established the East-Pakistan colony in Karachi, Sindh. In accordance, the East-Pakistani diaspora also composed patriotic tributes to Pakistan after the war; songs such as Sohni Dharti (lit.

It was the first fully supersonic aircraft to be deployed in Western Europe. The Draken was developed during the 1940s and 1950s to replace Sweden's first generation of jet-powered fighter aircraft, the Saab J 29 Tunnan and, later, the fighter variant (J 32B) of the Saab 32 Lansen. It featured an innovative \"double-delta\" wing; in order to test this previously-unexplored aerodynamic feature, a sub-scale test aircraft, the Saab 210, was produced and flown. Developed in Sweden, the Draken was introduced into service with the Royal Swedish Air Force (RSAF) on 8 March 1960. Early models were intended purely to perform air defence missions, the type being considered to be a capable dogfighter for the era. The Draken functioned as an effective supersonic fighter aircraft of the Cold War period. In Swedish service, it underwent several upgrades, the ultimate of these being the J 35J model. By the 1980s, the RSAF's Drakens had largely been replaced by the more advanced Saab 37 Viggen fighter, while the introduction of the more capable Saab JAS 39 Gripen fighter was expected in service within a decade, although delayed. As a consequence of cutbacks and high maintenance costs, the RSAF opted to retire the Draken during December 1999. The type was also exported to Austria, Denmark, Finland, and to the United States; the last operated the type as a training aircraft for test pilots.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"As the dawn of the Jet Age arrived, Sweden foresaw that there would be a need for a jet fighter that could intercept bombers at high altitude and also successfully engage fighters. During September 1949, the Royal Swedish Air Force (RSAF), via the Swedish Defence Material Administration, released its recently formulated requirement for a cutting-edge interceptor aircraft that was envisioned to be capable of attacking hostile bomber aircraft in the transonic speed range. As released, this requirement specified a top speed of Mach speed 1.4 to 1.5; however, during 1956, the specified speed was revised upwards to Mach 1.7-1.8. Other specified needs were that it had to be flown by a single pilot yet capable of conducting combat operations under all weather conditions or at night while being operated out of relatively austere airstrips while carrying all of the equipment needed to neutralise modern jet bombers. Although other interceptors, such as the US Air Force's F-104 Starfighter, were being conceived during the same period, the new fighter would have to undertake a role unique to Sweden. Specifically, it was required to include the ability to operate from reinforced public roads, which were to be used as part of wartime airbases; the aircraft would also need to be refuelled and rearmed in no greater than ten minutes by conscripts that had minimal training. In response to the release of the requirement, Swedish aircraft manufacturer SAAB commenced work on producing an aircraft to fulfil the identified role. Preliminary studies had found that the majority of the critical issues which were posed in meeting the requirement could be resolved via the adoption of a delta wing configuration. However, this posed difficulties of its own in that, so that to obtain an aerodynamically desirable location, the forward fuselage would need to be extended and, as a consequence, the aircraft would become unnecessarily heavy. The optimum solution to this conundrum was uncovered in the form of the \"double-delta\" wing. However, this wing configuration was unexplored quantity, and accordingly, SAAB's design staff on the project, headed by aircraft engineer Erik Bratt and a team of more than 500 technicians, opted to design and construct a small jet aircraft for the purpose of exploring the behaviour of the revolutionary new wing. This resulted in the only sub-scale test aircraft to be constructed in Sweden, the Saab 210, which was unofficially nicknamed \"Lilldraken\" (the little kite). The Saab 210, which tested the concept of the double delta wing, performed its first flight on 21 January 1952. The successful results produced by the test flights of the Saab 210 led to an order being placed for three full-size Draken prototypes. On 25 October 1955, the first of these prototypes, which was not fitted with an afterburner, conducted its maiden flight. According to aircraft publication Flight International, an atypically intensive flight test programme was conducted to define and test the type's exceptional speed range and complicated systems. The second prototype, which was equipped with an afterburner, unintentionally broke the sound barrier during its first flight while climbing. During 1956, the first operational version of the Draken, designated as the J 35A, was ordered into quantity production. During February 1958, the first production aircraft performed its first flight.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"The Saab 35 Draken is a fighter aircraft, equipped with a distinctive \"double-delta\" wing. According to Flight International, it is difficult to differentiate between what constituted as the fuselage and what would be defined as being of the wing. The fuselage has a circular section, and the inboard portion of the wing is a large-chord surface which extended aft of the engine intakes; it was possible to dispense with a tailplane, and the overall design is one of relative cleanliness. Draken's design incorporated a distinctive \"double-delta\" configuration, which featured one delta wing within another larger delta. The leading edge of the inner wing had an 80° angle for high-speed performance, while the outer wing, swept at 60°, provided for good performance at low speeds. The cockpit of the Draken featured mostly Swedish-sourced instrumentation. Successive models introduced various improvements to the cockpit fittings, such as the revised canopy and new avionics. For export customers, the Draken was outfitted with a Ferranti-built Airpass II fire-control radar, which was effective for acquiring various air-to-air or air-to-surface targets, along with a ground-mapping mode working in conjunction with the aircraft's navigation systems. Typically, two separate radio units would be installed, along with a high-speed data link and two navigation systems. As there is no natural feedback placed upon the stick, artificial forces were generated by a q-feel system. The Draken was also fitted with a three-axis autopilot. The fuselage of the Draken consisted of two sections, front and rear, joined by bolts. The forward section, which was integral with the intake ducts and neighbouring wing structure, accommodates the fire-control radar, cockpit, nose undercarriage, integral fuel tanks and various systems. The rear portion, which was manufactured as a single piece alongside the rest of the inner wing, contained the engine and afterburner, bag-type fuel tanks, armament, main landing gear, and other systems. The flight control surfaces consisted of a rudder, along with inboard and outboard elevons, the outer sections being fitted with mass-balance weights. Each surface was operated by a tandem hydraulic jack, which was connected to separate circuits. As a weight-saving measure, the hydraulic systems would operate at a line pressure of 2,987lb/sq, which would be greater than double the pressure used in the earlier Saab 29 Tunnan. Propulsion was provided by a single Svenska Flygmotor RM6B/C turbojet engine, a licence-built model of the Rolls-Royce Avon 200/300 engine. A ram turbine, positioned under the aircraft's nose, provided emergency power, while the engine also featured a built-in emergency starter unit. In order to reduce its landing speed when required, the Draken was equipped with a drogue parachute. The principal armament was carried externally, up to four AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles were carried on hard points beneath the wings and fuselage; alternative payloads include a variety of bombs and rockets, along with provisions the installation of a pair of 30mm cannons, located within each of the inboard wing panels. In place of the cannons, additional fuel tanks could be fitted in the same space. For aerial reconnaissance missions, a variety of camera pods could be carried underneath the fuselage.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"At the end of 1959, deliveries of the J 35A Draken commenced to the RSAF, the first unit to receive the type being fighter wing F13, stationed at Norrköping. During March 1960, the Drakens of unit F13 participated in a three-day long exercise, flying by night and day while operating under a state of \"highest readiness\" throughout. According to Flight International, the introduction to service of the J 35A was \"very smooth\", and that the scramble and turn-round times had been found to be \"most satisfactory\". By the end of 1960, multiple wings had been equipped with the Draken and had attained operational status. Although the J 35 Draken was not designed to serve as a dog fighter, it proved to have a good quick-turn capability and was a capable fighter plane. The early models were intended purely to perform the air defense mission. However, in order to assist pilots in converting to the type, Saab produced a small number of twin-seat J 35C trainer aircraft, the first of which having been completed during December 1959. During 1959, an improved air defence fighter model, designated as the J 35B, was developed, which featured improved performance and equipment over the J 35A. Amongst other things, it was powered by an improved engine fitted with an enlarged afterburner, a redesigned rear fuselage, a new Saab-built S.7 collision-course gunsight and fire-control radar, and integration with Sweden's STRIL.60 air defence control network. A total of 651 Drakens were manufactured by Saab. Sweden's fleet of Drakens comprised a total of six different versions, while two additional models of the Draken were offered to prospective export customers. The final model of the Draken to be produced was the J 35F, which was also the final version to remain in Swedish service. Its export customers included Denmark and Finland. In May 1985, the Austrian Air Force purchased 24 J 35Ds, which had been refurbished by Saab. The J 35 Draken design underwent several upgrades. The last of these was the J 35J version, which was produced during the late 1980s; by this point, the Draken had been almost entirely replaced by the Saab 37 Viggen in RSAF service. The Draken J 35J was effectively a service life extension programme, which had been initiated as a result of the impending delivery of the new Saab JAS 39 Gripen having suffered several delays. The extension program was intended to keep the Draken flying into the 2000s but, as a consequence of budgetary cutbacks and high maintenance costs being incurred with the type, the Draken was phased out of Swedish service in December 1998, although the aircraft has since remained operational in limited numbers within both military and civilian roles. All Drakens functioned as interceptors with limited air-to-ground capability; the sole exception to this rule was the Danish Drakens, which functioned as strike aircraft and were capable of carrying a mixture of AGM-12 Bullpup air-to-ground missiles, electronic countermeasures, and increased internal and external fuel storage. The Danish Drakens were the heaviest of the series to have flown. During 1993, the last of the Danish J 35 fleet were retired. During the 1990s, Finland updated its 35XS fleet with new avionics, cockpit displays, navigational/attack systems, and electronic countermeasures; these were finally retired in 2000 to be replaced by F/A-18 Hornets. Austria was the last country to have the Draken in active military service. The Austrian Air Force bought refurbished J 35Ds. This was the last Austrian Air Force fighter plane fitted with internal cannons to perform their lone air-to-air armament because of the restriction in the Austrian State Treaty of 1955, which had forbade their carrying of air-to-air missiles. During 1993, this restriction was dropped as a response to airspace violations made by neighbouring Yugoslavian air combat services. American AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles were purchased. In 2005, these Drakens were retired, having been replaced by former Swiss Air Force F-5 Tiger IIs, while waiting for new Eurofighter Typhoons to take their place in the long term. In the United States, the National Test Pilot School (NTPS) operated six Drakens that were formerly in Danish service.

For mission safety, weeks before the crewed mission, an LK-R uncrewed L3 complex and two Lunokhod automated rovers would be sent to the Moon, to work as radio beacons for crewed LK, with the LK-R used as a reserve escape craft. The Lunokhods were also equipped with manual controls for the cosmonauts, both for transfer to LK-R in necessity and for regular research. The N1 rocket would then carry the L3 Moon expedition complex, comprising two spacecraft (LOK and LK) and two (Block G and Block D) boosters. A variant of the Soyuz craft, the \"Lunniy Orbitalny Korabl\" (LOK) command ship, would carry two men, with three modules like the regular Soyuz 7K-OK, but was heavier by a few tons. The 7K-OK was half the mass of the three-crew Apollo orbital command ship. The \"Lunniy Korabl\" (LK) accommodated only one cosmonaut, so in the Soviet plan, only one cosmonaut would land on the Moon. The mass of the LK was 40% of the mass of the Apollo lunar lander. The L3 complex to be placed in LEO by the N1 was 93 tons (compared to Saturn V's 137 tons). The mass of the LOK and LK was 40% of the Apollo complex, but was equivalent to the L3 complex without Block G. The booster for the LEO toward the Moon for the Apollo vehicle was provided by the last stage of the Saturn V, while for the Block D, LOK and LK, this was to be provided by Block G of the same L3 complex. During the L3 complex's journey to the Moon, there would be no need to undock and re-dock the orbital and landing craft as was done in Apollo, because the cosmonaut would transfer from the LOK to LK by a 'spacewalk'. On the Apollo missions, the transfer was done using an internal passage. Block D was to slow the LOK and LK into lunar orbit, while with Apollo this phase was undertaken by firing the engine on the service module to slow the complex and enter lunar orbit since the Apollo complex traveled with the Command Module and Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) facing back towards the Earth. Once in orbit, the LK with Block D would separate from the LOK and descend toward the surface of the Moon using the Block D engine. After Block D exhausted its fuel, the LK was to separate and complete landing using its own engine. On the Moon, the cosmonaut would take Moon walks, use Lunokhods, collect rocks, and plant the Soviet flag. After a few hours on the lunar surface, the LK's engine would fire again using its landing structure as a launch pad, as with Apollo. To save weight, the engine used for landing would blast the LK back to lunar orbit for an automated docking with the LOK. The cosmonaut then would spacewalk back to the LOK carrying rock samples.

The second group was led by Alexei Leonov and concentrated on the landing mission (Commanders: Leonov, Popovich, Belyayev, Volynov, Klimuk; Engineer-cosmonauts: Makarov, Voronov, Rukavishnikov, Artyukhin). As a result, Leonov has the strongest claim to have been the Soviets' first choice for the first man on the Moon. After Komarov's death in Soyuz 1 in 1967, Gagarin was taken out of training and the groups were restructured. Despite the Soyuz 1 setback, the Soviets successfully rehearsed the automated docking of two uncrewed Soyuz craft in Earth orbit in 1968 and with the crewed Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 joint mission in early 1969 tested the other key mission elements. A total of 18 missions were related to the N1-L3 project.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"After the US Moon landing in 1969, the justification for the Soviet lunar landing program largely evaporated, although development and testing continued into the early 1970s. In 1970–1971 the LK was ready after three uncrewed test flights in LEO (Kosmos 379, Kosmos 398, Kosmos 434). The LOK launched once (Kosmos 382 7K-L1E, a dummy of 7K-LOK). The Krechet lunar spacesuit and support systems were tested. Four N1 test launches in 1969 (twice), 1971, and 1972 were failures, despite improvements after each crash. The second launch, on 3 July 1969 (an attempt to upstage Apollo 11 by 13 days), resulted in the destruction of the rocket and the entire launch complex, which delayed the N1-L3 program for two years. In an automatic Moon flyby, these first two launches of the N1 carried the 7K-L1S spacecraft (modified 7K-L1). The dummy 7K-LOK (7K-L1E) and regular 7K-LOK with dummy LKs were used in the third and fourth launches. The complete L3 lunar expedition complex with the 7K-LOK and LK for the Moon flyby and landing was prepared for a fifth launch, using a modified N1 rocket in August 1974. If this mission and the next had been successful, it would have led to the decision to launch up to five Soviet crewed N1-L3 expeditions in 1976–1980. To gain technical and scientific interest in the program, the modified multi-launched N1F-L3M missions were planned to have significantly more time on the Moon's surface than Apollo. However, N1-L3 (as well as N1F-L3M) program was canceled in May 1974, and Soviet crewed space efforts subsequently concentrated on the development of space stations and on several designs and ground preparatory processes for a Mars mission, which continues to the present day, but has unclear objectives. A Moon base, Zvezda, that was proposed later, developed mockups of expedition vehicles and surface modules, and \"Vulkan-LEK\" project were not adopted for economic reasons. As some recompense and as a replacement for the crewed landing program, the Soviets fulfilled a program of automated delivery of lunar soil and Lunokhod automated Moon rovers. The launch pad and MIK of N1 were redesigned for the Energia-Buran shuttle program. Five LKs and three LOKs remain, at least, with some kept in the designer's and producer's company museums. Nearly 150 engines produced for first stages of N1F were kept by the manufacturer (Kuznetsov Design Bureau), then sold for use on other launchers beginning around 2000.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"* THE SOVIET crewed LUNAR PROGRAM","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Goodies is the debut studio album by American singer Ciara. It was released on September 28, 2004 via Jazze Pha's Sho'nuff Records and LaFace Records. After writing songs for several established acts, Ciara's talents were noticed by Jazze Pha, and she began to work on what became Goodies. The album's conception came through the title track, created as a female crunk counterpart to Usher's \"Yeah!\" and Petey Pablo's \"Freek-a-Leek.\" Ciara worked with several writers and producers on the album, including Jazze Pha, Lil Jon, Bangladesh, R. Kelly, Johntá Austin, Sean Garrett, and Keri Hilson, among others. With Goodies, Ciara was hailed as the \"Princess\" or \"First Lady of Crunk&B\". The album uses dance music while utilizing pop, R&B, and hip-hop influences. The album delivers contradictory lyrical content, featuring female empowerment and independence-promoting lyrics in songs like the title track, while others show interest in adult activities. Critics gave the album positive to mixed reviews, commending the \"Goodies\"-esque songs, while deeming others as unoriginal and noting Ciara's limited vocal abilities. Most critics compared the work to late singer Aaliyah, and also said it had qualities of Destiny's Child. The album was a commercial success. In the United States, the album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, selling 124,750 copies in its opening week. It was later certified triple Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and as of June 2010, had sold over 2.7 million copies in the United States. The album also fared well internationally, being certified Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) and silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Goodies earned Ciara two Grammy nominations at the 48th Grammy Awards including Best New Artist and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"1, 2 Step\" in 2006.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"In her mid-teens, Ciara formed the all-girl group Hearsay with two of her friends. The group recorded demos, but as time went on, they began to have differences and eventually parted ways. Despite this setback, Ciara was still determined to reach her goal and signed a publishing deal as a songwriter. After leaving the group Hearsay, Texas native Ciara earned a writing job via her manager, for Atlanta's Tricky Stewart and The-Dream's RedZone Entertainment, penning songs for Mýa and Fantasia among others. According to Ciara, no one believed in her dreams of hearing her own music on the radio until she met producer Jazze Pha in 2002. Within five months of meeting her, Pha signed her to his Sho'nuff label and they had already recorded five tracks. About Ciara, Jazze Pha said, \"What was really lacking is the Janet Jackson, high-energy dance [music]. Ciara fills that void. She's pretty, she can dance, she can write music, and kids love her. Everyone loves her.\"","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"After graduating from Riverdale High School in Riverdale, Georgia in 2003, she was signed by LaFace Records executive, L.A. Reid, whom she was introduced to by Jazze Pha. She began production on her debut album later that year. Recording sessions for the album took place at Chocolate Factory, Chicago, IL; Circle House Studios, Miami, FL; Darp Studios, Atlanta, GA; Doppler Studios, Atlanta, GA; Futuristic Recording Studios, Atlanta, GA; Ground Breaking Studios, Atlanta, GA; Hit Factory Criteria, Miami, FL; Hitco, Atlanta, GA; Patchwerk Recordings, Atlanta, GA; Phoenix Ave. Studios, Atlanta, GA; Sony Music Studios, New York, NY; Studio 609 Recordings, Philadelphia, PA; The Studio, Philadelphia, PA. In early 2004, Ciara wrote a demo with record producer Sean Garrett, co-writer of Usher's crunk hit \"Yeah.\" After hearing a demo, crunk producer Lil Jon, who also produced and was featured on \"Yeah\", began to work on the full record, to have it released on LaFace, which was also Usher's label. Originally, Ciara was reluctant to work with the track produced by Lil Jon, reportedly disliking crunk music at first. However, she decided to use the song to go against the grain and deliver lyrics in contrast of female promiscuity lines delivered by fellow female artists. To give her a title to stand out, Lil Jon dubbed Ciara as the \"Princess of Crunk&B.\" Dubbed the female counterpart to \"Yeah\" and fellow crunk hit \"Freek-a-Leek\" by Petey Pablo, it looked to capitalize on the success of the previous songs. In addition to working with Jazze Pha, who produced most of the album, Lil Jon, and Garrett, she worked with several other Atlanta-based writers and producers including Bangladesh, Johntá Austin, Jasper Cameron, and others, while featuring collaborations from Atlanta's T.I. and Ludacris. R&B singer R. Kelly wrote and produced a track. When talking about the album's theme, Ciara said it was universal, stating, \"It's about everybody. You'll have songs with different emotions, happy, sad, 'my heart is broken.' What everybody goes through.\" On her success with the preluding title track, Ciara said, \"I'm very content right now. I take everything a day at a time. Every time I hear good news, I'm shouting out, 'Praise God.' Everybody around me is so excited, I still haven't got it. I haven't really felt it like they're feeling it for me.\"","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"The album consists of bouncy dance music mixed with crunk, combined with either R&B, pop or hip hop music. The ballads on the set utilize Ciara's breathy vocals, as the uptempo pieces. Lyrical content varies on the album. Songs like \"Goodies\" issue a message of female empowerment and abstinence, and this is contradicted as she hints at teasing sex. Slant Magazine compared this to Britney Spears-esque \"layer of tease to the mature\" in her early work. Utilizing influences from 80's dance music, qualities of the work of Destiny's Child and Aaliyah are evident. \"Goodies\" is heavily influenced by male counterpart crunk song \"Yeah\" and also has been compared to Kelis's \"Milkshake.\" The song makes use of a repeated whistle, \"faux operated vocals\" in parts and a western guitar riff near the end. \"1, 2 Step,\" which continues the club music theme, is built around a simple dance and features Missy Elliott in a pas de deux. and according to Mike Pattensden of The Times, \"owes plenty to classic New York electro.\" \"Oh,\" a downtempo song, features a heavy bassline and has been called \"brooding electronic grind,\"  and, according to Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian, \"sounds like R&B reimagined by Gary Numan.\" \"Pick Up the Phone\" was described as a rip-off of Aaliyah's \"Rock the Boat\" by Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine. \"Next to You,\" written by R. Kelly, is part of the album's second half of ballads, and was said to capture \"Ciara's youthful indecisiveness.\" \"Hotline\" features a \"funky clap\" and beatboxing.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Goodies lead single, the title track, featuring Petey Pablo, was released on June 8, 2004. Conceived as a crunk female counterpart to Usher's \"Yeah,\" the lyrical content goes against the grain, speaking of abstinence, rejecting advances because \"the goodies will stay in the jar\". Critics hailed it as an \"anthem of the summer\" and one of the best singles of the year, complementing its dance-feel and beat, and the irony of the \"clever\" lyrics. The single performed well worldwide, topping the charts in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, and charting in the top ten of other charts, receiving Platinum certification in the United States. The music video shot for the song features Ciara partying with friends. \"1, 2 Step\", featuring Missy Elliott, was released as the second single, incorporating a hip-hop and dance-pop feel, deriving influences from 1980s electro music. While topping the charts in Canada, it additionally appeared in the top ten of six other countries, and was certified Platinum or Gold in multiple regions. The accompanying music video features Ciara and others performing the dance. The song was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards. \"Oh\", featuring Ludacris, proclaimed as a love song to Atlanta, was released as the album's third single on March 5, 2005. Carrying a slow, dark tone, critics noted \"Oh\" as a standout track from Goodies. The song performed well worldwide, appearing the top ten of seven charts, and certified either Platinum or Gold in multiple regions. The song's music video, which is similar to that of \"Goodies\", takes place at a block party, and was nominated for Best R&B Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. The album's final single, \"And I\", was released on August 30, 2005, and only managed to peak at ninety-six on the Billboard Hot 100. The music video for \"And I\" is loosely based on the 1992 film, The Bodyguard, and NBA player Carmelo Anthony portrayed Ciara's love interest.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Raymond Fiore of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B and commented, \"If Aaliyah had lived to make another CD, it might have sounded like Goodies,\" and said that other album cuts \"prove she's no one-track pony.\" Noting the singles \"Goodies,\" \"1, 2 Step,\" and \"Oh\" as standout tracks, Allmusic gave the album three and a half out of five stars. Steve Jones of USA Today said, \"The voice doesn't blow you away, but as with Goodies, she takes a lyrically intriguing offbeat path from time to time. Though not every song is a goodie, she does have a few treats in store.\" Even though he said the album wasn't a perfect work, Azeem Ahmad of musicOMH said, \"The talent is obviously there but if we are to carry out Ciara's wish of forgetting about \"the other chicks\" then there's some fine-tuning needed. For now there's no direct threat to any other hip-hop divas, but the void left by Aaliyah is still there for someone to try and fill. There's no reason why Ciara can't one day hold her own with the best.\" Jalylah Burrell of PopMatters commented that \"Goodies is nothing new, but it is executed well.\" Although pointing out the flaws of Goodies, Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian said, \"Ciara has no conviction as a sweet-talker but her disconnected style clicks perfectly with the cold, clinical (in a good way) hits.\" Mike Pattenden of The Times said, \"Goodies has some tasty treats, but they're all stacked on top of the jar,\" commenting that Ciara's \"whispery, girlish voice that is often relegated to the background by stronger performers, suggesting she is little more than a pretty mouthpiece for Jon and his posse of producers.\" Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani compared it to the work to Aaliyah, stating some of it was not up to par with the late singer, but complimented the title track-esque tracks.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"The album debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, selling 124,750 copies in its initial week.

Allison Stewart of The Washington Post commented that she has a \"reedy, agile voice, capable of conveying the only three emotions (sexy, sassy, sad) an R&B singer needs. Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times commented that \"Ciara has been the most synthetic of the R&B divas over the past decade, an electro-leaning vocalist whose instrumental palate has heavily favored stark 808 beats, sassy and seductive vocal lines.\" In the early to mid-2000s, some crunk music hits like \"Get Low\", \"Goodies\", \"Yeah!\" and \"Freek-a-Leek\" produced by Lil Jon climbed to the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 charts. Both \"Yeah!\" and \"Goodies\" were the first tracks to introduce the substyle of crunk music and contemporary R&B, called crunk&B, to the public. Both of those tracks (performed by Usher and Ciara, respectively) were the main mainstream hits of 2004. Since then, crunk&B has been one of the most popular genres of sung African-American music, along with electropop, the genre that replaced crunk and crunk&B in the charts in 2008. After the album's lead single reached the summit of the US Billboard Hot 100, it spent seven weeks at number one, becoming the longest-running number-one debut single by a female artist since 1977 The album's lead singles success exemplified urban music's commercial dominance during the early 2000s, which featured massive crossover success on the Billboard charts by R&B and hip hop artists. In 2004, all 12 songs that topped the Billboard Hot 100 were African-American recording artists and accounted for 80% of the number-one R&B hits that year. Along with Usher's streak of singles, Top 40 radio and both pop and R&B charts were topped by OutKast's \"Hey Ya!\", Snoop Dogg's \"Drop It Like It's Hot\", Terror Squad's \"Lean Back\", and Ciara's \"Goodies\". Chris Molanphy of The Village Voice later remarked that \"by the early 2000s, urban music was pop music.\" The work helped Ciara earn several nominations, including Best New Artist at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards. Several Goodies singles received several nominations at different ceremonies, which included \"1, 2 Step\" being nominated at the 48th Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.

Kösem achieved power and influenced the politics of the Ottoman Empire when she became Haseki Sultan as favourite consort and later legal wife of Ottoman Sultan Ahmed I (r. 1603–1617) and Valide Sultan as mother of Murad IV (r. 1623–1640) and Ibrahim (r. 1640–1648), and grandmother of Mehmed IV (r. 1648–1687). She was one of the prominent figures during the Sultanate of Women. Kösem lived in the Ottoman Empire as a courtier during the reign of six sultans: Ahmed I, Mustafa I, Osman II, Murad IV, Ibrahim, and Mehmed IV. After her death, she was known by the names \"Valide-i Muazzama\" (magnificent mother), \"Vālide-i Maḳtūle\" (murdered mother), and \"Vālide-i Șehīde\" (martyred mother).","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Kösem is generally said to be of Greek origin, the daughter of a priest on the island of Tinos whose maiden name was Anastasia but these views do not seem reliable. She was bought as a slave by the Bosnian governor, and sent, at the age of fifteen, to the harem of Sultan Ahmed I. Upon her conversion to Islam, her name was changed to Mahpeyker (Moon-Faced, meaning \"beautiful\"), and later by Sultan Ahmed I to Kösem.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Kösem rose to prominence early in Ahmed's reign as part of a series of changes to the hierarchy of the imperial harem. Safiye Sultan, Ahmed's once-powerful grandmother and manager of the harem, was deprived of power and banished to the Old Palace (Eski Saray) in January 1604, and Handan Sultan, Ahmed's mother and Valide Sultan, died in November of the following year. These two vacancies allowed Kösem to rise to the top of the imperial harem hierarchy from her previous position as the Sultan's second or third concubine. As a Haseki Sultan to Ahmed I Kösem was considered his favorite consort and gave birth to many of his children. During her time as haseki sultan she received 1,000 aspers a day. As the mother to a number of princesses she had the right to arrange their marriages which were of political use. Venetian ambassador Simon Contarini mentions Kösem in his report in 1612 and portrays her as: Contarini reported in 1612 that the Sultan ordered a woman to be beaten for having irritated Kösem. She may have been Kösem's fellow consort Mahfiruz, mother of Ahmed's eldest son Osman. Kösem also made efforts to keep her brother-in-law Mustafa safe from execution, and may have regarded Mahfiruz as a rival intent on lobbying in favor of her own son. After Mahfiruz's apparent expulsion from the palace, probably in the mid-1610s, Kösem and Osman grew fond of each other. She used to let him join her in carriage rides where he showed himself to the crowd, but once this came to Ahmed's attention he forbade any conversation between them. Kösem's influence over the Sultan increased in the following years and it is said that she acted as one of his advisers. However, she refrained from involving herself constantly in serious issues as the Sultan refused to be overshadowed by his wife. Kösem is sometimes accused of trying to save her own position and influence throughout her long career \"rather than that of the sultan or of the dynasty\". Kösem also had a long career as a guardian of şehzades. It is possible that the significant modifications in the pattern of succession to the throne during Ahmed's time owed something to her efforts. She must have realized the personal gain that might stem from the transition to seniority coupled with the fact that she was no longer haseki but had a son \"in waiting\". According to the Venetian ambassador, Kösem \"lobbied to spare Mustafa the fate of fratricide with the ulterior goal of saving her own son from the same fate.\"","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Like his parents, Ahmed died at a young age (27 years) on 22 November 1617. This made Kösem lose her position in Topkapi Palace and she retired in the Old Palace during the reign of her brother-in-law Mustafa I and step-son Osman II. Due to the emergence of seniority as the principle of succession, which meant that a prince's mother might mark time in the Old Palace between the death of her master and the accession of her son, Kösem was able to maintain her Haseki status and daily stipend of 1,000 aspers during her retirement there; still, after the end of Kösem's tenure as haseki, the position lost its prominence. In 1619, her step-son Osman II paid her a three-day visit at the Old Palace, thus manifesting his special fondness for her. Even if their relation was cultivated, though, it did not yield consequential results for the young Sultan, whose most exceptional weakness was the lack of a Valide Sultan, a queen mother, to lobby in his favour.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Kösem came back in power when her son ascended to the throne on 10 September 1623 as Murad IV. Since her son was a minor, she was appointed not only as a Valide Sultan but also, as an official regent (naib-i-sultanat) during his minority, from her son's ascension on 10 September 1623 until 18 May 1632. During most of Murad IV's reign, she essentially ruled through him and effectively ran the empire, attending meetings of the divan (cabinet) from behind a curtain, even after 1632, when she was no longer regent. During the early years, the Empire fell into anarchy; the Safavid Empire invaded Iraq almost immediately, Northern Anatolia erupted in revolts, and in 1631 the Janissaries stormed the palace and killed the Grand Vizier, among others. Murad feared suffering the same fate as his elder brother, Osman II, and decided to assert his power. He later tried to quell the corruption that had grown during the reigns of previous Sultans, and that had not been checked while his mother was ruling through proxy. His absolute rule started around 1632, when he took the authority and repressed all the tyrants, and he re-established the supremacy of Sultan.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Kösem's other son, Ibrahim, lived in terror of being the next of his brothers to be executed by Murad's order. His life was only saved by the intercession of his mother Kösem Sultan. After Murad's death, Ibrahim was left the sole surviving prince of the dynasty. Upon being asked by the Grand Vizier Kemankeş Kara Mustafa Pasha to assume the Sultanate, Ibrahim suspected Murad was still alive and plotting to trap him. It took the combined persuasion of Kösem and the Grand Vizier, and personal examination of his brother's dead body, to make Ibrahim accept the throne. When Ibrahim succeeded his brother in 1640, he proved too mentally unstable to rule. This enabled Kösem to continue in power. He was encouraged by his mother to distract himself with harem girls. The distractions of the harem allowed Kösem to gain power and rule in his name, yet even she fell victim to the Sultan's disfavor and left the Imperial Palace. Ibrahim's behaviour sparked talks of deposing the sultan. In 1647, the Grand Vizier Salih Pasha, Kösem Sultan, and the şeyhülislam Abdürrahim Efendi unsuccessfully plotted to depose the sultan and replace him with one of his sons. Salih Pasha was executed and Kösem Sultan was exiled from the harem. The next year the Janissaries and members of the ulema revolted. On 8 August 1648, Ibrahim was dethroned, seized and imprisoned in Topkapı Palace. Kösem gave consent to her son's fall, saying \"In the end he will leave neither you nor me alive.

At the head of the Ottoman Empire stood the child sultan, Mehmed IV. With Mehmed's ascendancy, the position of Valide Sultan (\"mother of the reigning sultan\") should have gone to his mother Turhan Hatice Sultan. However, Turhan was overlooked due to her youth and inexperience. Instead Kösem Sultan was reinstated to this high position. Kösem Sultan was a valide (mother) under two sons, thus having the more experience of the two women.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"It was Mehmed IV's mother, Turhan Hatice, who proved to be Kösem's nemesis. When she was about 12 years old, Turhan was sent to the Topkapı Palace as a gift, from the Khan of Crimea, to Kösem Sultan. It was probably Kösem Sultan who gave Turhan Hatice to Ibrahim as a concubine. Turhan turned out to be too ambitious a woman to lose such a high position without a fight. In her struggle to become Valide Sultan, Turhan was supported by the chief black eunuch in her household and the grand vizier, while Kösem was supported by the Janissary Corps. Although, Kösem's position as Valide was seen as the best for the government, the people resented the influence of the Janissaries on the government. In this power struggle, Kösem planned to dethrone Mehmed and replace him with another young grandson. According to one historian, this switching had more to do with replacing an ambitious daughter-in-law with one who was more easily controlled. The plan was unsuccessful as it was reported to Turhan by Meleki Hatun, one of Kösem's slaves, that Kösem was said to be plotting Mehmed's removal and replacement by another grandson with a more pliant mother. Whether Turhan sanctioned it or not, Kösem Sultan was murdered three years after becoming regent for her young grandson. It is rumoured that Turhan ordered Kösem's assassination. Furthermore, some have speculated that Kösem was strangled with a curtain by the chief black eunuch of the harem, Tall Suleiman. The Ottoman renegade Bobovi, relying on an informant in the harem, states that Kösem was strangled with her own hair.

It seems that the promontory overlooking the village was the location of a Roman camp (of which no trace has been found) situated on a Roman road which linked the Santones capital of Mediolanum Santonum (Saintes) to the port of Novioregum (Barzan), a few kilometres to the east. Only traces of this period, such as the remains of pottery, terra cotta, and amphoras, have been found in the surrounding fields. In the 11th century Arces was a small village with a church dedicated to Saint Martin. Between 1083 and 1091 Arnaud de Gammon from the House of Mortagne founded the Abbey of Vaux which gave him all the rights and privileges of the parish of Arces. The monks installed two priories in Arces: one near the church of Saint Martin and the second in the hamlet of Loriveau. Of the latter there remains a bridge built over the Désir stream. During this period the economy was based on cereals, grapes, the salt marshes along the Gironde, and timber. Arces became a stage on the Way of Saint James to Santiago de Compostela, as many pilgrims went to Talmont-sur-Gironde to cross the Gironde. In 1151 Benoît de Mortagne invaded the village and attempted to monopolize the land and privileges of the priory of Saint-Martin. Threatened with excommunication, he was forced to retire and promise to respect the rights of the abbot. The parish depended for a long time two-thirds on the Barony of Cozes and the remaining third on the Lordship of Talmont. Conflicts between the lords and the villagers seem to have been commonplace. In 1661 Mademoiselle d'Orleans, purchaser of the Barony of Cozes, required new Corvées or unpaid labour from the residents but was dismissed by the Parliament of Bordeaux. Several noble houses seem to have existed under the old regime: the Logis du Breuil, the Chateau of Theon, and that of Conteneuil'' are still visible. In the 17th century the Dame de Theon became famous for her hatred of the Calvinists who she persecuted. This hatred was so strong than her lordship was besieged by the troops of Benjamin de Rohan, Duke of Soubise, one of the principal leaders of the Protestants, and whose brother was killed during the Siege of Royan (1622 or 1624). She seized the possessions and demolished the houses of Protestants who, reduced to poverty, went to bring the matter before the Duchess of La Trémoille. Having the right of justice, she condemned to death between 140 and 160 Protestants, some being broken on the wheel and the others hanged. After the Revolution the parish was converted into a commune. The population in 1790 reached 1129 inhabitants but the rural exodus quickly brought the number to about 474 at the end of the Second World War.

The church seems to date back at least to the 11th century. In 1086 it was given to the Abbey Saint-Étienne de Vaux. It was rebuilt in the 12th century. The three-sided apse, in Romanesque style, dates to that period and is the only vestige of the original building which was considerably altered during its history. Significant work took place from 1670 which altered the structure of the nave. The façade was built in 1703. It consists of a door with a broken triangular pediment topped with a rectangular bay window and framed by two massive buttresses. The sanctuary consists of a nave with only two bays intersected by a transept extended by two Gothic stately chapels which replaced the Romanesque apses in the 14th century. The octagonal bell tower, surmounted by a slate spire, stands at the crossing of the transept. The decoration of the apse was completely redesigned in the 19th century: the frescoes, murals, and the painted sky on the ceiling date to this period. The stained glass windows and statuary adorning the building also date from the same period. The retable, which is in the choir, was restored in 1994. Located on a promontory overlooking the village, the church has a panoramic view of the hills, the Gironde estuary, and the coastline of the Médoc. It contains a chalice with paten (18th century) which are registered as an historical object. ;Church picture gallery","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"*Communes of the Charente-Maritime department","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"<references group=\"Note\"/>","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"*J.-F.

The band themselves were pleased with the album, with Mackenzie saying \"as a band we were happy with Seven, it met our expectations of ourselves.\" The album was released in May 1999 and received positive reviews from music critics. Allmusic said \"fans of the band will not be disappointed,\" whilst The Living Tradition said that \"with this album Wolfstone prove they are bigger than any one member and they \"rock on\".\" The band decided to carry on as a band and toured in promotion of Seven in 2000, resulting in the live album Not Enough Shouting, which, among its fourteen tracks, features nine of the eleven tracks on Seven recorded live. Seven and Not Enough Shouting were the band's only albums with pianist-keyboardist Andy Simmers, who committed suicide in April 2000; he had contributed a sombre solo piano instrumental, \"John Simmers\", to Seven.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"In 1996, Wolfstone, then led by Ivan Drever and Stuart Eaglesham, both of whom wrote, sang and played guitar for the band, released their fourth album The Half Tail to critical acclaim. The album was recorded at CaVa Studios, Glasgow, a break from their usual Edinburgh studio of Palladium Studios, and featured a change of producer in Chris Harley. After the release of the album, the line-up slightly changed when keyboardist Struan Eaglesham left the band to start a family. He was replaced by long-time friend and colleague Andy Thorburn, but after \"relentless\" touring around the globe, drummer Graeme \"Mop\" Youngson also left the band, as the rigours of being on the road and away from home on an almost constant basis had a \"telling effect\" on his health. Shortly afterwards, the band had intentions of breaking up, but continued to fill contractual obligations in the form of already booked live concerts throughout 1998–1999. In this period, Aberdonian Ronnie Simpson joined the band on drums and Andy Simmers from Inverness played keyboards. The band \"split up\" in 1998, where they found themselves £40,000 in debt as, throughout their career, \"they had seen a lot of people make money out of the band, but very little of that ever trickled down to the band members.\" The \"split\" was picked up by the newspapers and national radio in a particularly negative way and to the casual reader may have led to the impression that the wider interest in traditional music was in decline, and many people were annoyed by the coverage. Furthermore, the band could not \"really plan any future work as Wolfstone\" whilst still under the contract of their record label Green Linnet Records. A collaboration album between Drever and the band's bassist Wayne Mackenzie, originally released as Drever-Mackenzie in 1997, was re-released as Wolfstone album entitled This Strange Place in 1998 as a contract filler. The album, which features a much softer tone than Wolfstone, was released to mixed reviews when issued as a Wolfstone album, with many fans unaware that this was a repackaging of a side-project release and that the band had not \"mellowed\". Drever and the band's fiddlist Duncan Chisholm recorded their side-project collaboration album The Lewis Blue, released on Wolfstone's former label Iowa Records in 1998, before Drever himself left Wolfstone, leaving Eaglesham by default to become the sole leading force in the band. Nonetheless, the band had ambitions to continue as Wolfstone, and in 1998, the band realised that \"at some point they had to make ‘the big decision’, whether to continue or not,\" but, before making that decision about their long-term future, from August 1998 the band still had to fulfill the last elements of their contract with Green Linnet Records, whose contract required another album from the band, with this album ultimately being Seven. The remaining members of the band chose to write and record the required album with full attention, rather than make a \"half-hearted\" album. MacKenzie explained: \"We could have just gone through the motions and made a half-hearted attempt at an album, but we didn’t. The band and our fans mean far too much to us to do that.\" The band recorded the album with new drummer Tony Soave from December 1998–January 1999. Pleased with Robin Rankin's co-production work on The Half Tail, the band rehired him to co-produce Seven. The band themselves were pleased with the album, with Mackenzie saying \"as a band we were happy with Seven, it met our expectations of ourselves.\" Commenting in 2001, they said \"we are as much a folk band as we ever were, Duncan is the strong traditional influence, but we all come from different musical backgrounds.\"","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Seven consists of songs written and sung by Eaglesham and numerous instrumentals, most of them originals by the band. Describing the sound of the album, Chris Mackenzie of The Living Tradition said that \"straight from the off it's all there. Thumping bass, big guitar chords, Rock and Roll drumming and of course the twin hendrixs of fiddle and pipe giving the unique Wolfstone sound.\" He also commented that, \"however, a full CD of full throttle ceilidh would be tough on the neck muscles of even the most ardent rocker so they do slow it down occasionally.\" Rick Anderson of Allmusic commented that, \"as rock & reel bands go, this Scots band is considerably more rock than reel,\" saying the band's approach \"is sort of an inversion of that taken by groups like the Oyster Band and the Pogues, whose music is based on traditional material infused with a rockish intensity. In Wolfstone's music there's plenty of Highland pipes and fiddle, but the predominant voices in the mix are overdriven electric guitars and drums; the overall impression is one of rock & roll infused with Celtic influences rather than the other way around. And if the singing sometimes comes off as a bit fey, it's fey in a heavy metal sort of way, high-pitched and modestly operatic.\" Opening instrumental \"Psycho Woman\" shows the band in \"full flow\", with Mackenzie saying it shows \"Wolfstone kick more ass than Rambo and Robocop put together and are tighter than Pamela Anderson's swimsuit.\" \"Brave Boys\", which Anderson said seemed \"to be an antiwar tune\", features Stuart Eaglesham delivering \"a lovely melody over a churning Hammond organ and driving acoustic guitars, whilst \"a fiddle keens away in the distance.\" Two of the instrumental sets, \"Quinie Fae Ryhnie\" and \"Maggie's\", were described by Mackenzie as showing Wolfstone \"prove that when they really want to rock the joint they can do it at will.\" The former track was noted for its experimentation. \"Jen's Tune\" and \"John Simmers\", the latter a \"delicately played\" track featuring Andy Simmers on piano, the only musician and instrument on the track, provide a \"perfect foil to the hard rocking of the rest of the CD.\" \"John Simmers\" fades into \"J-Time\", one of the band's most celebrated instrumentals. \"Fingal's Cave\" is an extract of poetry by Ian Chrichton Smith set to a tradition tune.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"The album was released on 18 May 1999 by Green Linnet Records. Although it is the band's fifth official studio album, the album was named Seven as it is their seventh \"official\" album overall, including This Strange Place and 1997 compilation Pick of the Litter, disregarding the band's early, originally unreleased albums. The album was released to critical acclaim, with critics impressed with the band after the departure of Drever. Rick Anderson of Allmusic rated the album four stars out of five and said that \"fans of the band will not be disappointed.\" He called the instrumentals \"fine\" and complimented Eaglesham's melody on \"Brave Boys\" as \"lovely\". Chris Mackenzie of The Living Tradition was also very favourable, commending the band's strength after the departure of Drever, saying \"with this album Wolfstone prove they are bigger than any one member and they \"rock on\".\" He said \"Ivan Drever's absence might not make a huge difference to the Wolfstone sound in full flight but he defined the vocal sound of the band. Despite Ivan and Stuart Eaglesham sharing vocal duties over the last few albums, Ivan was the Wolfstone sound. Well he isn't anymore, Stuart has the floor, and he acquits himself well.\" He described \"Quinie Fae Ryhnie\" as \"excellent\" and \"John Simmers\" as \"delightful\". Duke Egbert of The Daily Vault was less favourable, grading the album \"B–\" and questioning the near-absence of bagpipes. He did, however, point out numerous stand out tracks and moments. Although the band's financial problems continued, with \"legitimate bills for costs incurred during tours\" often coming as a complete surprise to the band members, \"the mess\" was eventually \"sorted out\". Mackenzie said \"when we realised the extent of the problems, I personally phoned everybody and said ‘we have a debt and we will pay it. How can we work it out?’ It took us three and half years to sort it out - but we did it.\" MacKenzie had pointed out \"that they now don’t owe anybody anything.\" Having already escaped from their financial and contractual obligations, the band carried on making a \"fresh start\", touring in promotion of Seven, and continuing to tour even after keyboardist Andy Simmers committed suicide in April 2000. Pete Heywood of The Living Tradition recalled \"there was much soul searching\" in the band after Simmers' death, \"but fan encouragement, which had played a big part in their tale over the last fifteen years, was a major factor in them deciding to get back on the road.\" The band recorded the live album Not Enough Shouting on the tour in January and February, which was released in 2000 and features nine of the eleven tracks from Seven alongside five older tracks by the band. The album was conceived as \"an important element\" of the band's \"plan to re-establish the band as a touring unit,\" and was released to critical acclaim as the first release on the band's newly established record label, Once Bitten Records, where they had control over promotion and were able to maximise the impact of sales at gigs. The band followed Seven with Almost an Island in 2002, which squashed rumours that Seven would be the band's final studio album. Several of the tracks from Seven have since appeared on numerous various artists compilation albums. \"J-Time\" featured as the band's sole entry into Green Linnet Records' anniversary \"best-of\" album Green Linnet Records: 25 Years of Celtic Music (2001), and also featured on Mandeca Records' compilation Celtic: The Essential Album (2002), whilst \"Psycho Woman\" was included on CNR Music's Belgium-released Friends of Folk: Volume 4 compilation (1999).","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Teniatyska is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Lubycza Królewska, within Tomaszów Lubelski County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland, close to the border with Ukraine.

Minaj's father was addicted to alcohol and other drugs, and had a violent temper, burning down their house in December 1987. She has two siblings. As a small child, Minaj and a sibling lived with her grandmother in Saint James. Her mother, who had moved to The Bronx, New York to attend Monroe College, brought the family to Queens, New York when Minaj was five. By then, the family had a house on West 147th Street.

In August, Minaj announced that the album would be entitled Pink Friday, a play on \"Black Friday\". The following month she released \"Check It Out\" and \"Right Thru Me\" as follow-up singles. In October, Minaj became the first female solo artist to have seven songs on the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously and the first woman to appear on MTV's Annual Hottest MC List.

Upon release, the album received generally positive reviews from critics. Sam Wolfson of NME complimented Minaj's \"pop sensibility\" and found her \"volatility and quirks ... reminiscent of heyday Lil Wayne\". Entertainment Weeklys Brad Wete commended Minaj's \"knack for melody\" and \"boasting lyrics\". Allison Stewart of The Washington Post wrote that the album \"nibbles at the edges of what female rappers are allowed to do, even as it provides a steady helping of pop hits\".

Minaj's crossover into pop music was criticized by some, despite her commercial success. Minaj was sued by Chicago artist Clive Tanaka in September 2013 for its alleged copyright infringement. Follow-up singles \"Beez in the Trap\" and \"Right by My Side\" were released shortly after. Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded was eventually released on April 2, 2012, two months later than planned.

The combination is often, if not always, intoxicating\". At the 58th Grammy Awards, Minaj received three more Grammy Award nominations, including a second Best Rap Album nomination for The Pinkprint. On June 29, Minaj became the only artist to win the BET Award for Best Female Hip-Hop Artist for five consecutive years, while also tying Missy Elliott for the most wins, with five in total. In November 2014, Minaj released a video containing Nazi-style imagery for her third single \"Only\". There was immediate backlash from the Anti Defamation League, who stated that it was \"troubling that no one among Minaj's group of producers, publicists and managers raised a red flag about the use of such imagery before ushering the video into public release.\" They called the video \"insensitive to Holocaust survivors and a trivialization of the history of that era.\" On November 9, 2014, Minaj hosted the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards at The SSE Hydro, Glasgow, Scotland. She also won the Best Hip-Hop Award for a second time. In March 2015, Minaj embarked on her third world tour entitled The Pinkprint Tour and also became the first female artist to chart four songs simultaneously in the top 10 of Billboard's Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop airplay chart. At the 2015 BET Awards, Minaj won her sixth consecutive award for Best Female Hip-Hop Artist, becoming the female rapper with most wins in that category. In September 2015, it was announced that Minaj would executive produce and appear in a scripted single-camera comedy series for ABC Family (now Freeform) based on her life growing up in Queens, New York. The show was titled Nicki and the pilot episode was filmed in Minaj's hometown in January 2016. In October 2016, Minaj stated the filming was postponed for undisclosed reasons.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"In May 2015, it was announced that Minaj would feature in the third installment of the Barbershop film series, alongside Ice Cube, Cedric the Entertainer, Eve, and other original cast members. Titled , the film was released on April 15, 2016, and received critical acclaim, earning an average score of 93% on Rotten Tomatoes; the site's critical consensus reads, \"Heartfelt, thought-provoking, and above all funny, Barbershop: The Next Cut is the rare belated sequel that more than lives up to the standard set by its predecessors.\" Minaj's character in the film is a \"sassy\" hairdresser named Draya. For her performance, she was nominated for a Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress: Comedy. In February 2017, Minaj was featured on Jason Derulo's single \"Swalla\", which reached the top ten in several countries, including a peak of number six in the UK singles chart. Justin Ivey from XXL wrote that Minaj \"comes through to close out the track with bars that steal the show\". The following month, Minaj signed with the major modeling agency, Wilhelmina Models. On March 20, 2017, when her songs \"No Frauds\", \"Changed It\", and \"Regret In Your Tears\" were released simultaneously, Minaj broke the record for the most Billboard Hot 100 entries for a female artist in the chart's history, which was previously held by Aretha Franklin. In May, Minaj opened the 2017 Billboard Music Awards with a medley performance that was described by Rolling Stone as \"flamboyantly produced\" and \"dexterous\". Throughout the remainder of 2017, Minaj performed on several singles, including Migos' \"MotorSport\" and Yo Gotti's \"Rake It Up\", both of which peaked in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 chart, at numbers six and eight, respectively.

In 2010, she said that although she originally felt obligated to mimic the provocative behavior of the \"female rappers of [her] day\", she intended to subdue her sexuality because she \"[wants] people—especially young girls—to know that in life, nothing is going to be based on sex appeal. You've got to have something else to go with that.\" The rapper has made autographing breasts part of her movement to empower women. A New York Times editor said that some consider her to be \"the most influential female rapper of all time\". In a Guardian interview, Minaj said she competes with male and female rappers. In \"Moment 4 Life\", she refers to herself as a \"king\" rather than a queen. Early in her career Minaj claimed to be bisexual, but eventually clarified her sexuality in a Rolling Stone interview: \"I think girls are sexy, but I'm not going to lie and say that I date girls.\" Minaj has been called the \"black Lady Gaga\" because of her costumes and wigs. In one interview, Minaj rejected the comparison, but in another interview, she said that she is inspired by Gaga's creativity. Minaj has cited Alexander McQueen, Gianni Versace and Christian Louboutin as her favorite designers. The Huffington Post described her style as \"risk-taking\" and \"far-out\", with \"bold sartorial choices\"; Yahoo! called her dress \"colorful\" and \"crazy\", and \"the fashion and music world would certainly be very quiet without Ms Minaj\". Minaj talked about feminism in an interview with Vogue in 2015, saying \"There are things that I do that feminists don't like, and there are things that I do that they do like. I don't label myself.\" Billboard listed Minaj the fourth-most-active musician on social media on its March 2011 Social 50 chart. Minaj is the world's most followed rapper on Instagram. On Twitter, she is one of the most followed rappers, with over 20 million followers on the app.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"In May 2017, Minaj offered via Twitter to pay college tuition fees and student loans for 30 of her fans. She appeared to grant their requests, ranging from $500 to school supplies to $6,000 for tuition, promising to respond to more requests in a month or two. She also announced that she would launch an official charity for student loans and tuition payments in the near future. In the same month, Minaj revealed on Instagram that she has been donating money to an Indian village for a few years via her pastor, Lydia Sloley. These donations helped the village get a computer center, a tailoring institute, a reading program and two water wells. \"This is the kind of thing that makes me feel the most proud,\" she said about the new additions to the village. In August 2017, after Hurricane Harvey hit the city of Houston, Texas, Minaj answered a social media challenge by comedian and actor Kevin Hart and donated $25,000 to the Red Cross, saying she was \"praying for everyone there\".","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Minaj is known for her animated rapping style, her flow in particular. She often combines metaphors, punch lines and word play into her work, which has been compared to her mentor Lil Wayne. The New York Times called Minaj \"a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones.\" Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: \"What people don't know is that before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I was just doing regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird shit—I'm not mad at it because it got everyone's attention.\" Noted as a rap artist, she lends herself to electronic music genres (especially electropop). Pink Friday marked her exploration of the genres, spawning electro songs including the pop-laden \"Super Bass\". Also combining rap with synthesizer music, Minaj's second album had a number of electro-hop and electropop songs: \"HOV Lane\", \"Whip It\", \"Automatic\", \"Come on a Cone\", \"Young Forever\", \"Fire Burns\", \"Roman Holiday\" and \"Beez in the Trap\"; while \"Starships\" is a eurodance song. She collaborated with other artists, producing more electronic songs: \"The Boys\" with \"Me & U\" singer Cassie and \"Beauty and a Beat\" with Justin Bieber. Her verse in Kanye West's \"Monster\" was critically acclaimed and contributed greatly to her popularity; many critics said she had the best verse in the song. Her alter egos are incorporated with her lyrics in British accents (Roman Zolanski) or soft-spokenness (Harajuku Barbie). Ice-T said about Minaj's rapping style, \"[Minaj] does her thing. She has her own way of doing it. She has an ill [sic] vocal delivery. She kind of reminds me of a female Busta Rhymes, like how she throws her voice in different directions.\" Minaj's \"Monster\" verse was listed by Complex as the best rap verse of the 2010s. West claimed at one point he considered deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work: It was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of \"Monster\" because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would do all that work, eight months of work on \"Dark Fantasy\" and people to this day would say to me 'My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj's verse.' So if I let my ego get the best of me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment…","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"With her parents frequently fighting during her childhood, Minaj lived through characters she created as a means of escape. She recalled that \"fantasy was my reality\" and her first identity was Cookie, who became Harajuku Barbie and (later) Nicki Minaj. In November 2010, Minaj assumed the alter ego Nicki Teresa, wearing a colorful headdress and calling herself \"healer to her fans\" during a visit to the Garden of Dreams Foundation at Fuse Studios in New York. She introduced another alter ego, Rosa (pronounced with an exaggerated R), to commemorate her December 2010 appearance on Lopez Tonight. For Pink Friday, Minaj created another alter ego: Roman Zolanski, \"a demon inside her\", Minaj's \"twin brother\" whose character she assumes when she is angry. Roman has been compared to Eminem's alter ego Slim Shady, and on \"Roman's Revenge\" Minaj and Eminem collaborate as their alter egos. On her next album, she said that there would be a lot of Roman: \"And if you're not familiar with Roman, then you will be familiar with him very soon. He's the boy that lives inside of me. He's a lunatic and he's gay and he'll be on there a lot.\" Roman has a mother, Martha Zolanski, who appeared on \"Roman's Revenge\" with a British accent and singing on \"Roman Holiday\" for the first time. Martha appeared in the \"Moment 4 Life\" video as Minaj's apparent fairy godmother. Although Minaj was rapping in songs such as \"All I Do Is Win (Remix)\", she promised to introduce Nicki, Roman and Onika on her first album.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Minaj cites Foxy Brown and Jay-Z as major influences: \"I really loved [Foxy] as a female rapper. I was really interested in her mind and her aura [and] I was really, really into Jay-Z. Me and my friends in high school, we were reciting all of the Jay lyrics. His words were our words in our conversations all the time.\" She said, further: \"I never really told Foxy how much she has influenced me and how much she changed my life, and you've gotta tell people that when they're alive to even be able to take the compliment, instead of paying tribute to them when they're no longer here\", adding that Foxy Brown was \"the most influential female rapper\" for her, though she initially was compared to Lil Kim when she first debuted. Nicki and Lil Kim, often cited as Foxy's main rap rival, have reportedly exchanged words with each other, on social media and in their music. Jada Pinkett Smith is one of Minaj's role models in her acting career. Minaj was inspired by R&B singer Monica, singing \"Why I Love You So Much\" at every talent show she entered. Performing in Atlanta on her Pink Friday Tour, she called Monica one of her all-time greatest musical influences. Minaj has also cited Kanye West, Trina and Drake as influences. She called Betsey Johnson a fashion inspiration: \"[Betsey] is a free spirit. When I met her the other day, I felt like I knew her for my whole life. She's so warm and considerate and caring. She's amazingly talented and I've been wearing her clothes forever, so to meet her was like, 'Yay!' [I was] bowing down to her; she's dope!\" Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: \"When I first went to get my hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, you have to get your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting. Cyndi Lauper's videos – that's what intrigued me.\"","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Minaj has been affiliated with several manufacturing companies and has endorsed a number of products during her career.

In the record, Minaj recites: \"Tell that bitch with the crown to run it like Chris Brown/she won three rounds, I'ma need a hundred thou/like 'Chinatown' — bitches better bow down/oh you ain't know, betcha bitches know now/fuck I got a gun — let her know that I'm the one\". Minaj reportedly never confirmed or denied that the song was about Ma, however Ma remarked in a 2010 interview, \"To this day I still feel like [the song] is a stab at me; I'm gonna [diss Minaj] back for that one\". Although Ma and Minaj shared words of encouragement in recent years, their relationship soon soured, and they began releasing verses and songs with lyrics aimed at each other, including Ma's \"Money Showers\" with Fat Joe and Minaj's \"Make Love\" with Gucci Mane. On February 25, 2017, Ma released \"Shether\", which contained a number of accusations and allegations regarding Minaj’s personal and professional life. On March 3, 2017, during a visit to The Wendy Williams Show, Ma accused Minaj of \"trying to keep [her] off of red carpets\" and \"trying to make sure awards don't go to [her]\". A week later, in an interview hosted by BuzzFeed News, Ma stated that she had second thoughts about releasing the diss track, and commented on the difficulties of being a woman in the music industry. Minaj subsequently responded with the song \"No Frauds\", in which she accused Ma of spreading falsehoods. Minaj has been embroiled in a feud with veteran rapper Lil' Kim since her success with Pink Friday. Kim accused Minaj of copying her image saying, \"If you are going to steal my swag, you gonna have to pay. Something gotta give. You help me, I help you. That's how it goes to me.\" Minaj's single \"Roman's Revenge\" with Eminem was believed to be a response to Kim's comments, although she later denied this. She responded to the situation in an interview with HOT 97's Angie Martinez saying, \"She picked a fight with Foxy, then she picked a fight with Eve, then she picked a fight with Remy, then it was Mrs. Wallace, then it was Nicki Minaj. Every time you in the news, it's 'cause you gettin' at somebody! Where's your music? Put your music out, and when I see your name on Billboard, that's when I'll respond to you. Other than that, goodbye. It's Barbie, bitch.\" Lil' Kim reignited the feud with the release of her mixtape Black Friday (the title of which directly referenced Minaj). The artwork portrays Lil' Kim decapitating Minaj with a sword. A fragment of a diss track called \"Tragedy\" was released in response by Minaj in April 2011. Following the release of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, critics suggested that the track \"Stupid Hoe\" may have contained attacks directed at Kim. Lil' Kim later suggested in an interview with ''105's Breakfast Club'' that the song \"Automatic\" was similar to her unreleased material, also calling Minaj \"obnoxious\" and \"catty\". In November 2012, Minaj accused rock musician Steven Tyler and American journalist Barbara Walters as racists over comments surrounding her American Idol feud with Mariah Carey. In February 2014, Malcolm X's daughter Ilyasah Shabazz voiced her displeasure by the artwork of her slain father used \"inappropriately\" for Minaj's single \"Lookin' Ass Nigga\". A statement from the Malcolm X estate read: \"Ms. Minaj's artwork for her single does not depict the truth of Malcolm X's legacy, is completely disrespectful, and in no way is endorsed by [Shabazz or the Malcolm X] family.\" Minaj released an apology to the estate, however the rapper received backlash after remarks were made towards Shabazz in a mixtape recording (\"Chi-Raq\") that went: \"Malcolm X daughter came at me/lookin' ass niggas ain't happy/rolled out with some Latin Kings and some eses in them plain khaki's.\" In 2015, parties between Miley Cyrus and Minaj reached conflict after allegations of Minaj's impolite behavior was reported to The New York Times.

He set a 200 m personal best of 19.96 seconds at the 2000 United States Olympic Trials, and reached the 200 m final at the Sydney Olympics. He qualified for the IAAF Grand Prix Final in the 100 m and finished in fourth place. The following year he became the 2001 American indoor champion over 200 m, running a world leading time. However, a pile-up at the finish line resulted in a broken fibula, ruling him out for the rest of the athletics season. This included the 2001 IAAF World Indoor Championships in which he was previously a strong medal contender. The following year he missed much of the indoor track season due to hamstring problems, which were a knock-on effect of his previous injury. Upon his return in 2002 he won medals at a number of track meets in both the 100 and 200 m, including a personal best-equalling win of 9.98 seconds in the 100 m at Gresham. He again reached the Grand Prix Final but finished last. However, Tim Montgomery and Dwain Chambers who finished first and second later tested positive for banned substances and Miller was upgraded to sixth place. Forming an American team with Jon Drummond, Jason Smoots and Kaaron Conwright for the 2002 IAAF World Cup, Miller anchored the US to victory, setting a championship record of 37.95 seconds. He was ranked #7 in the world in both the 100 m and 200 m that year. The following year he failed to repeat this form, scraping Track and Field News' top ten US sprinters list.

However, his time of 9.99 seconds was not enough to edge out Maurice Greene, Justin Gatlin or Shawn Crawford. This was the first time that a sprinter had run under ten seconds at the event and not managed to qualify for the Olympics. He was also eliminated in the 200 m event, registering a sub-par 20.68 seconds. His time in the 100 m trials was convincing enough for a place in the 4 x 100 m relay squad, and the team (comprising Miller, Crawford, Greene and Gatlin) went on to finish second in the Olympic finals; resulting in an Olympic silver medal for Miller. Since the 2004 Olympics, Miller has not attended any major international competitions. However, he regularly competed at track meetings during the 2004–2008 period, running in the 100 and 200 meters, although his times were significantly slower in comparison to his 2004 peak.

The basic unit of account is an hour of service to an elderly person. Sometimes seniors help each other and earn the credits, other times family members in other communities earn credits and transfer them to their parents who live elsewhere. For example, an elderly woman who no longer has a driver’s license; if you shop for her, you get credit for that, based on the kind of service and the number of hours. These credits accumulate- users may keep them for when they become sick or elderly themselves, then use the credits in exchange for services. Alternatively, the users may transfer credits to someone else. A surprising part of the project has been that the elderly tend to prefer the services provided by people paid in Fureai Kippu over those paid in yen. This may be due to the personal connection. When they surveyed the elderly, it was clear they preferred the people who worked for Fureai kippu over the people who worked for yen because of the nature of the relationship. To convert this community service to yen would seem to dilute the community ethic. There are two clearinghouses that send the credits from one side of Japan to the other.

While ships of the Kosmos Line offered some passenger accommodations, they operated mainly as cargo carriers, with principle imports of the Line to Germany in this period including saltpetre, grain and tin. In September 1911, Rhakotis was stranded in the Scheldt on an outbound voyage, but was successfully refloated by lighterage and permitted to proceed. Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, Rhakotis violated Chilean neutrality by departing Valparaiso on 12 November secretly loaded with engine-room stores for Admiral Graf Spee East Asia Squadron, which included the cruiser, joining it on the 17th.

Peru and Germany severed diplomatic ties a few days later. By this time, the worldwide wartime shipping shortage had deprived Peru of the tonnage needed to maintain its coastal and international commerce, and in 1918 the Peruvian government decided to seize and utilize the German ships interned in Peruvian ports as a stopgap measure. Lacking both the facilities and the capital to repair the ships, the Peruvian government proposed to charter them to the United States. Under the proposal the U.S. would repair the ships, with the cost of repairs deducted from the charter fee, after which a small percentage of the tonnage would be returned to Peru for its own use, while the US would operate the remaining ships with any resulting profits split on a 50/50 basis. This proposal was accepted by the U.S., and in September 1918 the agreement was effected on a bareboat charter basis, with Rhakotis and five other German ships seized by the Peruvians coming under control of the United States Shipping Board (USSB). On the same day the charter agreement was signed, Rhakotis, along with another ship formerly belonging to the Kosmos Line, Sierra de Cordoba, were taken in tow at Callao by the American tug Culebra for transfer to the American settlement of Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, where the repairs would be effected; three more ex-Kosmos Line ships would later join them. At Balboa, damage to the machinery of the five ships was assessed as serious but not irreparable, with the main and auxiliary engine cylinders and valves having been broken, and the boilers damaged by \"dry firing\". Repairs to the five ships took some months, by which time the war was over. However, with the foreign contingent of the American Cruiser and Transport Force having withdrawn at the close of the war, the United States now needed additional ships to repatriate its victorious armies from France, and Rhakotis—renamed Eten by the USSB—became one of 56 ships selected for conversion to troop transports.

A total of 3,296 troops, including 46 sick or wounded, were returned by Eten to the United States on these two round trips. From Newport News, USS Eten departed for Norfolk on 5 May.

At least three round trips between New York and South Africa were completed by Eten to June 1920, the third of which was to Cape Town. In April of the same year, Australia's Daily Commercial News and Shipping List described Eten as \"a fine type of the combined passenger and cargo boat. She is very comfortably fitted in all respects. The cabins are spacious, while the drawing, smoking and other lounge rooms suggest that the vessel was originally designed for trade in the tropics.\" The paper reports that while Eten operators were readily filling the ship's 80 passenger berths, making the South African experiment \"successful enough to warrant continuance\", cargoes in both directions had been light, prompting the USSB to consider expanding Eten passenger accommodations from 80 to 360. One factor discouraging such work, however, was the ship's speed of \"only a little above the old twelve knots an hour.\" The USSB was also said to be considering purchasing the vessel from the Peruvian government. It is not known whether Eten passenger accommodations were ever expanded as proposed, but Eten was not purchased by the USSB and continued to operate under the Peruvian flag. In November 1920, while returning to New York via South America, a powerful radio \"of the telephone type\", capable of transmitting over a one-thousand-mile radius, was discovered hidden in a water tank in cabin 28 of Eten passenger berths. As the Peruvian military had disabled the ship's original radio when first interning the vessel, the discovery led to \"the obvious conclusion\" that the German crew may have continued communicating \"with German sea raiders\" during the ship's long wartime internment; the U.S. Navy was said to be preparing an investigation into the matter.

In January 1926, during a period of poor relations between Peru and Chile, a group of 36 Peruvian citizens arriving aboard Rimac at Tacna, Peru—then under Chilean control— were attacked by a Chilean mob. Many of the Peruvians were injured in the resulting melée. On 28 February 1931, Rimac and another steamer, Apurimac, were used to transport troops loyal to Provisional President Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro from Lima, Peru, to Mollendo, with the goal of defeating a contingent of rebel troops which had taken control of Arequipa. The loyal troops, led by Lieutenant Colonel Gustavo Jimenez and consisting of a machinegun battalion, a regiment each of cavalry, artillery and infantry and a police battalion, were given an enthusiastic send-off as they entrained at Lima by thousands of locals loyal to the regime. Before the troops were able to reach Arequipa however, Cerro was deposed in a coup on 1 March and the steamers were forced to return to Callao where the soldiers disembarked before marching on Lima and restoring Cerro to power on the 6th. In 1934, Rimac was transferred to the Peruvian Navy for use as a transport. In January 1936, Rimac responded to an SOS from the Chilean steamer Cautin, which had run aground at Lobos de Tierra. By the time Rimac arrived, however, most of Cautins passengers and crew had already been transferred to the American steamer Chimu. On 18 February 1939, Peruvian President Oscar R. Benavides departed Callao in Rimac, bound for a vacation in Pisca. Shortly after, General Antonio Rodriguez, Perus Minister of Interior and a leader of the fascist Unión Revolucionaria party, attempted with a small group of supporters to seize the Government Palace, declaring himself President in the process. Rimac was quickly ordered to return to Callao, with President Benavides sending a message from the ship denouncing the \"cowards\" involved in the coup attempt. Unknown to Benavides, the coup had already been crushed by troops loyal to the government, with five persons including Rodriguez himself having been shot and killed and several others wounded in skirmishing. In the aftermath of the attempted coup, remaining leaders of Unión Revolucionaria and other suspects were rounded up and jailed pending further investigation. Rimac remained in Navy service until 1948, when she was returned to the government. In 1950, she was transferred to the Peruvian Ministry of Marine.

In the early 19th century, Somali seamen barred entry to their ports along the coast, while engaging in trade with Aden and Mocha in adjacent Yemen using their own vessels. Due to the frequency of shipwrecks in the treacherous seas near Cape Guardafui, the British signed an agreement with sultan Osman Mahamuud of the Majeerteen Sultanate, which controlled much of the northeastern Somali seaboard during the 19th century. The agreement stipulated that the British would pay annual subsidies to protect shipwrecked British crews and guard wrecks against plunder. The agreement, however, remained unratified, as the British feared that doing so would \"give other powers a precedent for making agreements with the Somalis, who seemed ready to enter into relations with all comers.\" Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid of the Sultanate of Hobyo, which also controlled a portion of the coast, later granted concessions to an Aden-based French hotel proprietor and a former French Army officer to construct a lighthouse in Cape Guardafui.

Starting in 1899, the Italians undertook detailed studies and surveys to build a lighthouse and the first concrete project came out in 1904. Italy wanted the construction and maintenance costs of the future lighthouse to be shared by the maritime powers which would benefit most from the new lighthouse but Britain, which suspected that Italy also intended to build a coaling station that would compete with Aden, finally refused to contribute. Thus, it is only in the early 1920s that the authorities of Italian Somaliland finally made good on their promise to build a lighthouse. The first one, inaugurated in April 1924 as the Francesco Crispi Lighthouse, was a simple, functional metal-framed lighthouse built atop the headland. Simultaneously, a wireless station to monitor maritime traffic, which had been built in the nearly village of Tohen, was activated. A large-scale rebellion against Italian rule in that part of Italian Somaliland was underway at the time and troops guarding the new lighthouse and the wireless station repelled two attacks by several hundred rebels in November 1925 and January 1926. The lighthouse had suffered some damages during the attacks and this was one of the reasons that prompted the authorities to build a stronger, stone and reinforced concrete lighthouse, which was inaugurated in 1930. The striking new lighthouse was built in the shape of an Italian fascist \"Fascio littorio\". The lighthouse, which is no longer in use, still has the huge stone axe blade characteristic of fascist symbolism. A stone lighthouse and radio station were eventually built in the headland, with the former named after Francesco Crispi in 1930. The lighthouse has an original \"Fascio littorio\" exterior stone as a decoration, that is typical of fascist architecture promoted by Benito Mussolini. Italian authorities have requested a study to declare the lighthouse an \"historical monument\" of Somalia and a proposed World Heritage Site","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"On April 8, 2013, the Puntland government announced the creation of a new region coextensive with Cape Guardafui named Gardafuul.

Spyker's history of producing aero engines is reflected in details in these new cars as well as in the logo. Before building the C8, de Bruijn had been building small numbers of the Spyker Silvestris, which in many ways foreshadows Spyker's later cars. The C8 Laviolette and C8 Spyder have a 4172 cc Audi V8 engine delivering, acceleration 0–60 mph in 4.5 seconds and a top speed of . On July 14, 2005, it was announced that the C8 was approved for sale on the United States market. Between 2002 and 2006, Spyker built the C8 Double 12 S, which was available from the factory with 5 different levels of performance called Stage I (400 h.p.) through Stage V (620 h.p.), depending on the customer's need for performance. Between 2003 and 2007, Spyker built the C8 Spyder T, with the Twin turbo system being developed in conjunction with Cosworth in England. These engines were capable of 525 h.p. and 0-60 mph acceleration times of 4.0 seconds. In 2005, the head designer and founder, Maarten de Bruijn, left the company, and founded Silvestris Aquamotive which builds aluminum space frame speed boats. In 2006, Spyker built the C12 La Turbie with an V12 engine capable of 500 horsepower and acceleration from 0–60 mph in less than 4 seconds. In September 2006, Spyker bought out the Midland F1 team. The team competed in the final 3 races of the 2006 season as Spyker MF1. In the 2007, the team competed as Spyker F1 using engines supplied by Ferrari. Driver Adrian Sutil was paired with Christijan Albers until the European Grand Prix where the latter was replaced by reserve driver Markus Winkelhock; the team then signed Sakon Yamamoto to fill in the slot for the rest of the year. The team itself had minimal success, suffering from multiple retirements (including double retirements in Malaysia, Canada and Brazil) before Sutil scored the team's first and only point in Japan. At the end of the season, the team was sold to a consortium named \"Orange India\" led by Vijay Mallya and was subsequently renamed as Force India.

Early in 2007 the stock showed a sharp decline to levels beneath €13 because of financing issues. As a result, several stock issues were announced to big investors. Notably, all shares have been sold at higher prices than the market price at the moment of announcement. On November 13, 2005, Spyker Cars and Mubadala Development Company, a principal investment company wholly owned by the government of the United Arab Emirates, announced their strategic alliance, with Mubadala acquiring 17% of Spyker. Mubadala has a strong relationship with sports cars, also controlling 5% of Ferrari. In 2007, Spyker, in collaboration with the Italian car-design firm Zagato, produced the C12 Zagato, based on the C12 La Turbie, but with more appealing body work, faster speeds, and the Zagato trademark roof bubbles. This is perhaps the more exclusive Spyker car to date. In November 2009, Spyker announced that it would be moving production from Zeewolde to Whitley, Coventry, where assembly would be done in partnership with CPP Manufacturing.

On February 23, 2010, Spyker Cars closed the deal to buy Saab Automobile from General Motors. Spyker and Saab operate under the parent company Swedish Automobile, named Spyker Cars N.V. Saab Automobile quickly ran out of money and Spyker was unable to fund the losses. The companies stopped paying their bills early 2011. On March 30, 2011, production was halted at Saab Automobile, because suppliers refused to deliver without payment. Spyker CEO Victor Muller made several attempts at acquiring funding. A joint venture with Chinese company Hawtai was announced on May 3, 2011, only to fall apart a week later. Shortly afterwards joint ventures with Chinese car maker Youngman, and Chinese car-dealership chain Pang Da were announced. Negotiations ended with Spyker attempting to sell all of the shares in Saab Automobile to the Chinese companies on October 28, 2011, for 100 million euros. This transaction did not have the approval of former Saab-owner General Motors, who refused to supply technological licenses to Youngman and Pang Da. The proposed deal fell apart. Spyker CEO Victor Muller applied for the bankruptcy of Saab Automobile on December 19, 2011. On 16 April 2012, a meeting on Saab's bankruptcy was held at the District Court of Vänersborg.

On November 5, 2014, the Dutch Court \"Midden Nederland\" ordered Spyker to leave, within seven days, the factory they rented and to pay 152.000 euro in overdue rent. The claim was made by Jacques Walch, the owner of the factory rented by Spyker. Despite this, CEO Victor Muller insisted the company would be able to pay its bills \"in a matter of days.\" On 2 December 2014 Spyker NV was granted a moratorium of payment (financial restructuring) by the Dutch court \"Midden Nederland\". Spyker needed protection from creditors for its liquidity problems. Victor R. Muller, Spyker founder and chief executive, said \"Over the past few years, Spyker has faced a number of serious difficulties and challenges resulting from, among others, the legacy of the F1 era and the acquisition of Saab Automobile AB,\". On 18 December 2014 Spyker NV was declared bankrupt by the Dutch court \"Midden Nederland\". Victor R.

During this time we deployed several challenging activities. These have affected the company, and contributed to our decline,\". Spyker appealed the bankruptcy declaration, and on 29 January 2015, the court reversed the declaration. This meant that Spyker NV was protected from creditors, while solving its financial difficulties. This allowed Muller to pursue plans to merge Spyker with an unnamed \"US based manufacturer of high performance electric aircraft.\" This proposed merger partner was eventually discovered to be a company called Volta Volare. On May 13 of that year, Spyker NV closed a deal with the creditors. Spyker owed 44 million euro and agreed to pay 12.000 euro per creditor. The curator of Saab GB was the largest creditor; it claimed 24,9 million euro. Saab GB agreed to receive a payment of 61.000 euro.

After Peter runs to the bathroom and tackles most of the people in his way, Brady hires him for the New England Patriots. Peter wins many games for the Patriots but is fired for showboating and is traded to a team in London called the Silly Nannies. Peter plays versus the Patriots and loses, and returns home.

He subsequently gets drunk and has to make a run for the bathroom, knocking over everyone between him and the bathroom. Brady is impressed and gets Peter a spot on the New England Patriots football team as the starting center. Peter is soon fired for showboating in a game versus the Dallas Cowboys, driving on to the field then performing a massively-choreographed version of the song \"Shipoopi\" after scoring one touchdown. He is traded to the London Silly Nannies, who apparently have no clue on how to play football. Peter decides to turn them around and challenges Brady to a game between the Silly Nannies and the Patriots. On the opening kickoff, Peter's teammates become terrified of the Patriots rushing toward them and run away, leaving Peter to face them alone. He tries and is immediately tackled. However, Brady compliments Peter on having the nerve to stand up to them. Meanwhile, Stewie becomes a bookie and takes a $50 bet from Brian on a Celebrity Boxing match pitting Mike Tyson against Carol Channing. Brian bets on Tyson and loses. Stewie comes to collect, but Brian laughs him off and tells him he will have the money in 24 hours. After 24 hours, Stewie asks for the money owed, but Brian says he does not have it and to give him until next Friday. Stewie reveals that he is serious about settling the bet and, on two occasions, brutally beats up Brian (using such means as a golf club, shooting him in both knees with a pistol, and a flamethrower) to coerce him into paying up.

Actress Carol Channing made a guest appearance as herself in a scene in which Brian loses a $50 bet on a boxing match between her and professional boxer Mike Tyson, though Tyson did not voice himself. Sportscaster Bob Costas also voiced himself in a short scene in which he interviews Peter and Tom Brady. Much of the episode was scripted with Patriots coach Bill Belichick in mind, but Brady was chosen to replace him. After numerous requests for Brady to voice himself in the episode, he eventually agreed. Comedian Jay Leno voiced himself in two short scenes that show him, respectively, threatening and attempting to kill Brady. Two scenes in which Stewie graphically beats up Brian using a glass filled with orange juice, various household objects, and guns polarized people who viewed it. Several production members were offended. Cast members—as well as MacFarlane's mother and an animal rights advocate—enjoyed the scene; MacFarlane quoted his mother: \"I don't see what the problem is? He (Brian) owed him (Stewie) money!\", and so it was kept in the final cut. When Lois gives the finger to the camera during the interview with Peter and Brady, her hand was blurred out on Fox airings of the episode.

After the initial airing of the episode, where newscaster Tom Tucker announces a report on a fictional curse word, clemen, many viewers looked up the word on the Internet to try to find a definition. MacFarlane stated in the episode's DVD commentary that if someone invents an obscene definition for the word, the show will have to stop using it (it has not been used since this episode). In 2009, the bathroom scene was reused for a series of YouTube videos promoting the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series nominations that Family Guy received for consideration to voters for the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. In it, Brian considers voting for the fellow nominees—The Office, Flight of the Conchords, Entourage, 30 Rock, How I Met Your Mother, and Weeds. In the first five videos, Stewie brutally beats up Brian for his different votes, in their respective videos, asking \"Where's my Emmy man?\" and forces him to vote for Family Guy. In the last video, when Brian thinks about voting for Weeds, Stewie doesn't beat him up and instead says, \"Oh, fuck this.

The original number in The Music Man was performed by around 40 or 50 singers and around 80 other musicians, as estimated by MacFarlane. Family Guys rendition was recorded by an orchestra not as large as the original's, but one of the largest the show has ever used. Another musical number, in which the London Silly Nannies sing while dancing around a maypole, was taken from the Gilbert and Sullivan production The Sorcerer. A visual joke that shows Peter's $30,000 wax sculpture of Harriet Tubman \"doing\" a naked Gwyneth Paltrow originally featured the droid R2-D2 from Star Wars in place of Tubman.

She complains to her boyfriend, Puak, who went on a camping trip in Chiang Mai, that she feels so lonely. Every night, Pin exchanges text messages with a stranger, who asks to befriend her and seems friendly enough. The stranger says that he is in somewhere \"cramped\" for 100 days and is oddly only able to be contacted at night. After sending the mysterious stranger her photo, Pin asks for one in return and is sent the same photo. When she questions him, he says he is in the picture next to her. A ghostly face is slightly visible next to Pin's smiling face. As she researches recent deaths, Pin discovers that the son of Princess Sophia of Virnistan died and was buried with a cellphone so he can communicate with Princess Sophia—his mother, or to connect to someone else whenever he feels lonely. Pin then gets a text from the stranger, saying that he will come to her place now. All of the lights begin to go out and Pin cries in fear. She is then assaulted by the ghost and is thrown out of the window to her death. A scene from the past shows the prince receiving a text message from his girlfriend ending the relationship which makes him walk in front of a taxi cab causing an accident, the same accident that was the cause of Pin's broken leg as she was inside the cab. ;Deadly Charm (Thai title - ยันต์สั่งตาย, Yan Sang Tai; directed by Paween Purikitpanya) A nerdy student named Ngid sees his school friends take some drugs, and he is beaten to death.

Unfortunately, when he is beaten, he curses his friends on a deadly charm, which requires a photo of a person died with his/her eyes open. Things get worse when everything keeps moving by itself when ordered by Ngid's soul, and one by one the drug addicts start dying. Even though Pink did not beat him, Ngid's soul decides not to spare her too because she had seen it all yet had not do anything to help him. In the end, a police officer comes by to warn her not to go outside, and is shocked to see Pink laughing after having gouged her own eyes; because the curse requires the victim to see Ngid, he cannot harm her anymore now that she has gotten rid of her ability to see.

The rest are scared, but decide to stay and fight over who gets to sleep in the middle (they are frightened by Aey's story). That night, Aey comes back, but strange events happening afterwards make his friends suspicious. Shin then finds Aey's body. Frightened, they go running in the woods but are shocked to find their own dead bodies.

His original Castilian name is unknown, 'Saldanha' possibly referring to the Castilian town of Saldaña, which may have been his place of origin.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Being a man of \"some nautical experience\", Saldanha was appointed to head a squad of three vessels, part of Afonso de Albuquerque's fleet bound for India to reinforce the Portuguese settlement at Cochin. Although accompanying the India fleet, Saldanha's squad was said to have been given separate instructions to patrol the mouth of the Red Sea, and prey on Arab shipping. Saldanha's three-ship squad (himself, Rui Lourenço Ravasco and Diogo Fernandes Pereira) set out of Lisbon in early May 1503, intending to catch up with Albuquerque's main fleet, which had gone on ahead. Poor pilotage, however, led to numerous errors. The squad mistakenly sailed into the Gulf of Guinea, Saldanha and Lourenço alighting near São Tomé, with no idea where their third ship might be (Diogo Fernandes was actually on the proper track, sailing on alone). The remaining two began to make their way painfully south along the African coast, against the contrary winds and currents. Somewhere along the way, Saldanha and Lourenço lost sight of each other as well. Again, by poor piloting, Saldanha miscalculated his Cape crossing, and ended up making landfall just north of the Cape of Good Hope. To check if the cape had been surpassed, Saldanha anchored in the hitherto unknown Table Bay, and went ashore. Saldanha thus became the first European to set foot in what was to become modern Cape Town. Saldanha climbed the flat-topped mountain adjacent to the bay and identified the tip of the Cape (Cape Point) further to the south. He named the peak Table Mountain and (legend has it that he and his men) carved a cross in the rock of a nearby formation, traces of which can still be found on Lion's Head today. Saldanha replenished his water supplies at a local watering hole (he also got into a brief skirmish with local Khoikhoi and was slightly wounded), before returning to his ship. Table Bay was promptly named Aguada de Saldanha (Saldanha's watering stop) by Portuguese 16th-century cartographers. In 1601 a Dutch seafarer and cartographer, Joris van Spilbergen identified a bay further to the north of the Cape as Aguada de Saldanha. Henceforth this location became known as Saldanha Bay and the place where Saldanha anchored was renamed Table Bay. Events from here are a bit obscure. It seems after multiple attempts, Saldanha finally doubled the cape, but his ship was in sufficiently poor shape to force him to put into Mossel Bay for repair. A note left at that watering hole says he was still there in October, 1503. During this interlude, Rui Lourenço Ravasco was actually waiting for him in Mozambique Island. With no sign of Saldanha, Lourenço entertained himself with some freelance piracy on the East African coast, capturing ships off Kilwa and reducing Zanzibar and Barawa to tribute, and battling against Mombassa (who were besieging the Portuguese-allied Malindi). Diogo Fernandes, with still no idea where the others were, was waiting patiently in the mouth of the Red Sea by himself. Saldanha finally left South Africa and caught up with Lourenço Ravasco at Malindi. They proceeded together to force a treaty on Mombassa, before heading up to the Red Sea. Saldanha and Lourenço Ravasco spent the winter of 1503-04 around Cape Guardafui, capturing numerous Arab merchant ships. They were completely ignorant that Diogo Fernandes was just nearby, quietly wintering by himself at the island of Socotra. In the Spring of 1504, entrusting much of their stolen treasures to the safekeeping of the King of Malindi, Saldanha and Lourenço Ravasco sailed across the Indian Ocean to India. But badly battered, they were forced to stop for a long period of repairs and rest at Anjediva island, apparently unaware that, at the very moment, a desperate battle was being fought at Cochin, between the small Portuguese garrison and the large army of the Zamorin of Calicut. In September, 1504, Saldanha and Lourenço Ravasco were found by 6th India Armada, under the command of Lopo Soares de Albergaria, who helped them finish their repairs, annexed them into his fleet and proceeded down to Cochin. Saldanha participated in several actions in India in late 1504, notably the razing of Cranganore in October. In January, 1505, Saldanha joined the return fleet back to Lisbon. The fleet stopped by Malindi to pick up his deposited treasure and arrived in Lisbon in July.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"According to João de Barros, António  de Saldanha returned to the Indian Ocean in 1506, with the 8th Armada under Tristão da Cunha, albeit not as a captain of his own ship.

In late 1506/early 1507, when the fleet was lingering in Mozambique Island waiting for favorable winds, the admiral Tristão da Cunha placed his own flagship, the ''Sant' Iago'', under the temporary command of Saldanha, while he went off on some exploratory expeditions on the African coast in a smaller boat. Cunha soon came across the Flor de la Mar, the ship of João da Nova, who, on the return from India the previous year, had sprung a bad leak and been forced to stop for repairs.

As time goes on, Rebecca's obsession with Sara grows, which causes her to drive away anyone who could come between them. Rebecca attacks Tracy in the shower, pinning her down and ripping out her belly-button ring, and says that she is a bad influence on Sara and threatens to kill Tracy unless she stays away from Sara. Tracy moves to another dorm, fearful of Rebecca. An old friend of Sara's named Irene (Danneel Harris), who is a lesbian, invites Sara to move in with her when Sara's cat Cuddles is discovered. Rebecca then kills Cuddles by putting her in the dryer and lies to Sara that the cat ran away. Rebecca then inflicts injuries upon herself and says she was assaulted by a thug. Sara feels bad for her and decides to spend the Thanksgiving with Rebecca. When Sara's philandering fashion design professor, Roberts (Billy Zane), kisses her, Rebecca plans to get the professor out of the picture by seducing him while recording their dialogue on a tape recorder to make it sound like he was trying to rape her. During her stay, Sara overhears a conversation between Rebecca and her father (Tomas Arana), hinting Rebecca has had trouble making friends in the past. Rebecca's mother (Frances Fisher) mentions that Rebecca is supposed to be taking medication. She and Stephen later find a bottle of Zyprexa pills, used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

In December 1908, Thomas Edison formed a combination of his Edison Manufacturing Company and nine other owners of film-related patents: the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC), also known as the Motion Picture Patents Trust or the Edison Trust. The Trust controlled major patents dominating motion picture technology, including patents covering film stock, cameras, and projectors—including the so-called Latham loop patent (U.S. Pat. No. 707,934), a key feature of virtually all motion picture cameras then in use. Using the combined patent rights, the MPPC was able to exact high fees from their competitors for their use of film stock, cameras, and projectors. \"The MPPC quickly became a force to be reckoned with, frequently and strenuously asserting its patent rights against independent movie producers through litigation.\" Between 1909 and 1918, MPCC brought about 40 patent infringement suits against competitors to maintain its control over the industry. Initially, the federal courts refused to consider antitrust violation as a defense to a patent infringement charge. For example, in March 1910 in two cases in the Southern District of New York, the court held that \"the charge, if established, that the complainant is itself, or is a member of, a combination in violation of the federal anti-trust statute, is not a defense available in an action for the infringement of a patent. In a third case later that year, the court held: \"Such a suit [for patent infringement] is not based on contract, but on tort, and, of course, the fact that a man has entered into some illegal contract does not authorize others to injure him with impunity.” The Trust established a monopoly on all aspects of the motion picture business. Eastman Kodak, a member of the Trust, owned the patent on raw film stock and it agreed to only sell film stock only to other members. The camera patents prevented companies not members of or licensed by the Trust from making films. The projector patents enabled the Trust to require distributors and theaters to screen only the Trust members' films. In addition, the Trust established uniform prices for renting films to theaters. While the patents were in the main effective to establish industry control, in some instances the Trust made use of hired thugs and mob connections to violently disrupt productions that were not licensed by the Trust.

The first was that the \"gravamen of the offense may be gathered from the general summary that it is a conspiracy to drive from the field all other traders in the things which make possible the practice of the motion picture art, and to monopolize to themselves that trade, and through this the practice of the art itself.\" The defendants argued that they were not engaged in trade or commerce, to which the antitrust laws are limited: \"The control, with the seeking of which the defendants are charged, is therefore the control of an art, and not of trade, or of anything which is the subject of commerce, or can be brought within the laws relating thereto.\" The court brushed the argument aside. It said that \"the charge made against these defendants is that, whatever may have been their final purpose with respect to the control of the art, what they combined to do, and have done, is to restrain trade or commerce in these films, which are articles of trade and the subject of large interstate transactions, in which the defendants had part.\" The court turned to the main defense—that the defendants' ownership of patent rights relieves them of antitrust liability. The court conceded: The [patentee's exclusive] right to sell carries with it the right to withhold from sale, or to part with the possession without parting with the ownership. It also confers the right to impose reasonable and legal conditions of bailment or sale \"restricting the terms upon which the [patented] article may be used and the price to be demanded therefor.\" All these propositions are clear, and have been expressly held to be the law. But: \"The limitation that the terms must be legal should, however, not be lost sight of.\" For example, a post-sale restriction on price, \"which will follow the article through successive sales, will not be upheld.\" While the patent and antitrust laws must be accommodated to one another, \"it cannot be that the grant of a patent right confers a license to do that which the law condemns.\" A patentee may simply enforce his right to exclude infringement, but he must not use his patent \"as a weapon to disable a rival contestant, or to drive him from the field,\" for \"he cannot justify such use.\" The court said, \"As a conclusion to the whole discussion, we deem the Bath Tub Case to be decisive of the principle contended for by the United States.\" In that case, the Supreme Court found that the defendants' conduct \"transcended what was necessary to protect the use of the patent or the monopoly which the law conferred upon it. They passed to the purpose and accomplished a restraint of trade condemned by the Sherman law.\" They did so because they \"combined the manufacturers and jobbers\" to form a conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act. That brought the court \"to the consideration of the special facts of this case.\" The court said it would assume that the defendants had \"no purpose to offend against or to evade the law, and that their intentions were as beneficent and have resulted in an much good to the patronage of the art as is claimed, and that this good bears a fair relation to the profits received by them.\" That is irrelevant because, as the Supreme Court said in the Bathtub Case, \"the law is its own measure of right and wrong.\" The law is also: the judge of whether a transaction is of the character which it condemns. If, in the judgment of the law, a contract or co-operating agreement is such as to work an undue and unreasonable restraint of trade, and through such restraint to monopolize trade or any part of it, the judgment is one of condemnation, no matter how innocent or otherwise praiseworthy the motives of those who had part in it. The court then reviewed the defendants' course of conduct\"Shortly after the formation of the MPPC in 1908, it licensed 116 jobbers to distribute the members' films to theaters. Within a short time, however, the MPPC decided to absorb this part of the trade, and the General Film Company was formed to take over the business of distribution, and 115 of the 116 jobbers were eliminated. Lists of exchanges and of theaters were prepared, and then MPPC permitted no exchange to have films, and no theater to exhibit them, unless all of the defendants consented. No one could be on the approved list except such as bought all supplies from the defendants, and any who dealt with their competitors was dropped. Every theater was required to pay a royalty for the use of a projecting machine, even when the machine had been owned by the exhibitor before the MPPC combination was formed. The defendants did not merely combine to protect their patents against infringement. Their efforts: went far beyond the fair and normal possible scope of any efforts to protect such rights, and that as a direct and intended result of such undue and unreasonable restrictions the defendants have monopolized a large part of the interstate trade and commerce in films, cameras, projecting machines, and other articles of commerce accessory to the motion picture business. The court therefore concluded: [T]he contracts enumerated in the petition, and the combination there described, were a conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states and with foreign nations, and were and are illegal, and that the defendants and each of them . . . have attempted to monopolize, and have monopolized, and have combined and conspired, among themselves and with each other, to monopolize, a part of the trade or commerce . . . consisting of the trade in films, cameras, projecting machines, and other accessories of the motion picture business trade in films, cameras, projecting machines, and other accessories of the motion picture business. The court then ordered that the Trust must be dissolved. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"After the district court tried this case, several developments in case law adversely affected MPPC's position. In 1913 in ''Bauer & Cie. v. O'Donnell'', the Supreme Court held that a patentee could not use its patent to fix resale prices. Later, in October 1914, Congress passed the Clayton Act, making it an antitrust violation to sell goods on the condition that the buyer not deal in the goods of another seller. These were two of MPPC's practices. In addition, in ''Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.'', MPPC sued a licensee, Universal, to which MPPC had sold a film projector subject to the licensee's promise that only MPPC's films would be used in the machine. Because another company's films were subsequently used with the machine, MPPC sued for patent infringement. The district court dismissed the complaint. The Second Circuit affirmed in 1916, holding: \"If the prohibitions of the Clayton Act mean anything at all, this case falls within them, and the restrictions as to use of films other than complainant's with the projecting machines are therefore void.\" In 1917 the Supreme Court affirmed this ruling in Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co. Finally, in January 1918, the Latham Loop patent was held invalid, removing the keystone of MPPC's patent structure. These rulings made it clear that it was futile for MPPC to pursue its Supreme Court appeal of the case, and in June 1918 MPCC stipulated with the government to a dismissal of the appeal.","sentiment":"en","name":"English","natural":"English"},{"value":"Veeram () is a 2016 Indian epic historical drama film written and directed by Jayaraj.

Veeram is the fifth film in Jayaraj's Navarasa series, the story adapted from Macbeth will be set in North Malabar and Jayaraj also takes inspiration from Vadakkan Pattukal (Northern Ballads). The film will abundantly use the martial art, Kalarippayattu. Jayaraj call the film his dream project. After completing the screenplay and conceptualising a production plan, he put a newspaper advertisement in search of producers. Chandramohan D. Pilai, a Qatar-based banker and an old friend of Jayaraj replied to the ad. In fact, almost thirty years ago Pillai already had a discussion with Jayaraj for producing a film and Jayaraj was interesting in directing it. The deal was finalised after which Jayaraj invited him to India for further discussions about the film's production plans, which likely requires a high budget. Pillai formed the production company, Chandrakala Arts in India for producing the film with collaboration from two of his friends, though they do not wanted to credit their names in the film. Jayaraj himself traveled to the United States in search of technical assistance for the film. Jayaraj did not wanted to cast superstars or experienced actor for the film as he do not want to compromise his directorial freedom as star actors often demand alterations in script to glamourise their characters. Audition for actors was conducted in three rounds, with first one conducted in Mumbai in October 2015, and second round in Chennai, and third in Kerala. Over 4500 candidates participated in the audition. Despite the search for a newcomer, Bollywood actor Kunal Kapoor was selected to portray the protagonist. He plays the role of Chandu Chekavar, an infamous warrior in the Vadakkan Pattukal (Northern Ballads) of North Malabar region in Kerala. Kapoor's name was confirmed in late December 2015. Preparing for the role, Kunal attended a Kalaripayattu training schedule in Mumbai, who was taught by a Gurukkal from Kollam in a strict schedule which started in October 2015. He also underwent weight training and increased muscle weight for the role. Kapoor said, it is every actors wish to play Macbeth and he had a long time wish to do an action film, so when he was offered the role he immediately signed it. During preparation period, apart from his martial art training, he had a regular reading workshop with Jayaraj and also learned Malayalam. His character was reported to have a beard and a man-bun.
