A chapel is said to have been established by the 6th/7th century Irish monk, Saint Mirin at a site near a waterfall on the White Cart Water known as the Hammils. Though Paisley lacks contemporary documentation it may have been, along with Glasgow and Govan, a major religious centre o the Kingdom o Strathclyde. A priory was established in 1163 from the Cluniac priory at Wenlock in Shropshire, England at the behest o Walter Fitzalan (d. 1177) High Steward o Scotland. In 1245 this was raised to the status o an Abbey. The restored Abbey and adjacent 'Place' (palace), constructed out o part o the medieval claustral buildings, survive as a [[kirk o Scotland]] parish kirk. One o Scotland's major religious houses, Paisley Abbey was much favoured by the Bruce and Stewart royal families. It is generally accepted that William Wallace the great hero o Scottish independence who inspired the film Braveheart was educated here. King Robert III (1390-1406) was buried in the Abbey. His tomb has not survived, but that o Princess Marjorie Bruce (1296-1316), ancestress o the Stewarts is one o Scotland's few royal monuments to survive the Reformation. Paisley coalesced under James II's wish that the lands should become a single regality and, as a result, markets, trading and commerce began to flourish. In 1488 the toun's status was raised by James IV to Burgh o barony. Many trades sprang up and the first school was established in 1577 by the toun Council. By the mid-nineteenth century weaving had become the toun's principal industry. Paisley is still very well-known for the Paisley Shawl and its distinctive Paisley Pattern which originated around this time. Through its weaving fraternity, Paisley gained notoriety as being a literate and somewhat radical toun, although it could be argued in a fiercely positive direction. By this time there was a real mixture o religious opinions and healthy drink-fuelled debate raged at night amongst the weavers, poets, merchants, masons and others. The poet Robert Tannahill lived in this setting, working as a weaver. The weavers o Paisley were also active in the Radical War o 1820.","name":"Scots","natural":"Scots","classification":"sco"},{"value":"Paisley was at one time famous for its weaving industry. For nearly a hundred years until the 1870s shawls o the Paisley pattern were in fashion. Until the Jacquard loom was introduced in the 1820s weaving was a cottage industry. This innovation led to the industrialisation o the process. As a result many weavers lost their livelihoods and left for Canadae and Australie. One o these, a man named John Hart and a Paisley mill owner, settled at Perth, Ontario, where he had a Book Store and Mercantile troke. Due to its ure, mild climate Paisley was for many years a centre for the manufacture o cotton sewing thread. At the heyday o Paisley thread manufacture in the 1930s there were 28,000 fowk employed in the huge Anchor and Ferguslie mills o J & P Coats Ltd ( Coats Viyella) said to be the largest o their kind in the world at that time. In the 1950s the mills diversified into the production o synthetic threads but with cheap foreign imports and the establishment by Coats o mills in Indie and Brazeel the writing was on the wall for Paisley and production began to diminish rapidly. By the end o the 1980s there was no thread being produced in Paisley. However, both industries have left a permanent mark on the toun in the form o the many places with textile related names, for example, Dyer's Wynd, Cotton Street, Thread Street, Shuttle Street, Lawn Street, Silk Street, Mill Street and Incle Street. The toun also supported a number o engineering works some o which relied on the textile industry, others on shipbuilding. With the demise o both these industries in the wast o Scotland the engineering works too have all but gone. In the mid 1970s industry in Paisley went into rapid decline. The preserve manufacturer Robertsons which was founded in Paisley in the 1860s closed its Stevenson Street factory and transferred production to Bristol, Manchester and London. This closure was followed by those o the engineering firms o Fullerton, Hodgart and Barclay and Whites Engineering. In 1981 the area was dealt a massive blow when Peugeot Talbot, formerly Chrysler and before that Rootes, announced that their Linwood factory just outside o Paisley would cease production. Almost 5000 workers were laid of. The knock on effect on other trokees in the area was immeasurable and, despite numerous regeneration projects, Linwood has never recovered. Brown and Polson commenced producing starch and cornflour in Paisley in the 1860s.

As pharaoh, she consummatit a liaison wi Gaius Julius Caesar that solidified her grip on the throne. She later elevatit her son wi Caesar, Caesarion, tae co-ruler in name. Efter Caesar's assassination in 44 BC, she aligned wi Mark Antony in opposition tae Caesar's legal heir, Gaius Iulius Caesar Octavianus (later kent as Augustus). Wi Antony, she bore the twins Cleopatra Selene II an Alexander Helios, an anither son, Ptolemy Philadelphus. Her unions wi her brithers produced nae childer.

She wis briefly ootlived bi Caesarion, who wis declared pharaoh, but he wis suin killed on Octavian's orders. Egyp became the Roman province o Aegyptus. Tho Cleopatra bore the auncient Egyptian title o pharaoh, the Ptolemaic dynasty wis Hellenistic, haein been foundit 300 years afore bi Ptolemy I Soter, a Macedonian Greek general o Alexander the Great. As sic, Cleopatra's leid wis the Greek spoken bi the Hellenic aristocracy, tho she wis reputit tae be the first ruler o the dynasty tae learn Egyptian.

Her legacy survives in numerous wirks o airt an the mony dramatizations o her story in literature an ither media, includin William Shakespeare's tragedy Antony and Cleopatra, Jules Massenet's opera Cléopâtre an the 1963 film Cleopatra. In maist depictions, Cleopatra is put forward as a great beauty an her successive conquests o the warld's maist pouerful men ar taken tae be proof o her aesthetic an sexual appeal.

Cleopatra's faither Auletes wis a direct descendant of Alexander the Great's general, Ptolemy I Soter, son of Arsinoe and Lacus, baith of Macedon. Centralization o pouer an corruption led the uprisings in an the losses of Cyprus and Cyrenaica, makin Ptolemy's reign the end o the maist calamitous o the dynasty. When Ptolemy went tae Roum wi Cleopatra, Cleopatra VI Tryphaena seized the croun but died shortly afterwards in suspicious circumstances.

Regairdless o the cause, she did till Ptolemy Auletes returned in 55 BC, wi Roman support, capturing Alexandria aided bi Roman general Aulus Gabinius. Berenice wis imprisoned and executit shortly efterwards, her aid allegedly bein sent tae the royal court on the decree of her faither, the keeng.

The first three years of thair reign war difficult, due tae economic difficulties, faimin, deficient floods o the Nile, and poleetical conflicts. Awtho Cleopatra wis mairit tae her young brither, she quickly made it clear that she haed no intention of sharin power with0 him. In August 51 BC, relations atween Cleopatra and Ptolemy completely broke doun. Cleopatra dropped Ptolemy's name frae offeecial documents and her face appeared alone on coins, which went against Ptolemaic tradeetion of female rulers bein subordinate tae male co-rulers. In 50 BC Cleopatra came intae a serious conflict wi the Gabiniani, powerful Roman troops of Aulus Gabinius who haed left them in Egypt tae pertect Ptolemy XII efter his restoration tae the throne in 55 BC.

At the time, fuel injection (or PI petrol injection, as it wis whiles cried back then) wis uncommon in road caurs. Sae muckle sae that Triumph claimed in thair sales brochure that it wis the \"First Breetish production sports caur wi petrol injection - PI\".

In order tae provide fresh fuel at the distributor, free frae owerheatin/soak, unuised fuel wis returned back tae the tank whaur it entered very close tae the heich pressure fuel pump. When the fuel level fell ablo critical (aboot 3 gallons), sloshing wad cause the pump tae pick up a slichtly aerated mixture which wis sent tae the fuel distributor. Unused fuel (still aerated) then passed back tae the tank an wis discharged close tae the pump, a proportion o it bein picked up an recycled tae the distributor. As this cycle wis repeated, gradually the volume o air in the pumped fuel reached a level whaur it began tae affect the running o the ingine.

Atoms are smaw eneuch that attemptin tae predict thair behaviour uisin clessical pheesics - as if thay war billiard baws, for ensaumple - gies noticeably incorrect predictions due tae quantum effects. Throu the development o pheesics, atomic models hae incorporatit quantum principles tae better expleen an predict the behaviour.

Tharefore, thay war nae atoms, but a new pairticle, the first subatomic pairticle tae be discovered, that he oreeginally cried \"corpuscle\" but wis later named electron, efter pairticles postulatit bi George Johnstone Stoney in 1874. He an aa shawed thay war identical tae pairticles gien off bi photoelectric an radioactive materials. It wis quickly recognised that thay are the pairticles that cairy electric currents in metal weirs, an cairy the negative electric chairge within atoms. Thomson wis gien the 1906 Nobel Prize in Pheesics for this wark. Sicweys he owerturned the belief that atoms are the indivrrsible, ultimate pairticles o matter. Thomson an aa incorrectly postulatit that the law mass, negatively chairged electrons wra distributed ootthrou the atom in a uniform sea o positive chairge. In 1909, Hans Geiger an Ernest Marsden, unner the direction o Ernest Rutherford, bombardit a metal foil wi alpha pairticles tae observe hou thay scaitert. Thay expectit aw the alpha pairticles tae pass straicht throu wi little deflection, acause Thomson's model said that the chairges in the atom are sae diffuise that thair electric fields coud nae affect the alpha pairticles muckle. Houiver, Geiger an Marsden spottit alpha pairticles bein deflectit bi angles greater nor 90°, that wis supposed tae be impossible accordin tae Thomson's model. Tae expleen this, Rutherford proponed that the positive charge o the atom is concentratit in a tottie nucleus at the centre o the atom. Rutherford compared his findins tae ane firin a 15-inch shell an it comin back tae hit the person wha fired it. While experimentin wi the products o radioactive decay, in 1913 radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that thare appeared tae be mair nor ane teep o atom at ilk poseetion on the periodic cairt. The term isotope wis coined bi Margaret Todd as a suitable name for different atoms that alang tae the same element. J.J. Thomson creautit a technique for separatin atom teeps throu his wark on ionised gases, that subsequently led tae the discovery o stable isotopes. In 1913 the pheesicist Niels Bohr proponed a model in that the electrons o an atom war assumed tae orbit the nucleus but coud anerly dae sae in a finite set o orbits, an coud jimp atween thir orbits anerly in discrete cheenges o energy correspondin tae absorption or radiation o a photon. This quantisation wis uised tae expleen why the electrons orbits are stable (gien that normally, chairges in acceleration, includin circular motion, lose kinetic energy that is emittit as electromagnetic radiation, see synchrotron radiation) an why elements absorb an emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra. Later in the same year Henry Moseley providit addeetional experimental evidence in favour o Niels Bohr's theory. In 1924, Louis de Broglie proponed that aw pairticles behave tae an extent lik swaws. In 1926, Erwin Schrödinger uised this idea tae develop a mathematical model o the atom that descrived the electrons as three-dimensional swawforms raither nor pynt pairticles. The development o the mass spectrometer allaed the mass o atoms tae be meisurt wi increased accuracy. The device uises a magnet tae bend the trajectory o a beam o ions, an the amoont o deflection is determined bi the ratio o an atom's mass tae its chairge. The chemist Francis William Aston uised this instrument tae shaw that isotopes haed different masses. The atomic mass o thir isotopes varied bi integer amoonts, cried the hale nummer rule. The explanation for thir different isotopes awaitit the discovery o the neutron, an unchairged pairticle wi a mass seemilar tae the proton, bi the pheesicist James Chadwick in 1932. In 1938, the German chemist Otto Hahn, a student o Rutherford, directit neutrons ontae uranium atoms expectin tae get transuranium elements.

The baund wur initially inspired bi the early wave o punk baunds, particularly the anarcho-punk movement (a sub-genre o punk muisic focused on anarchist politics) an groups athin that genre such as Crass. The first stable line-up o the group consistit o Nicholas Bullen on vocals an bass, Simon Oppenheimer on guitar, an Miles Ratledge on drums, an lastit frae December 1981 tae Januar 1982.

Simon Oppenheimer left the group in August 1982 an wis replaced bi Darryl Fedeski who left the group in October 1982: at this point, Graham Robertson began tae play guitar an Finbarr Quinn (ex-Curfew) joined on bass an backin vocals.

The group consistit o a 4-piece line-up o Miles Ratledge - drums, Bullen - vocals, bass an guitar, Graham Robertson - guitar an bass, an Damien Errington - guitar. Efter this concert, Ratledge an Bullen asked Broadrick tae join Napalm Death as guitarist, wi Bullen as vocalist an bass player.
