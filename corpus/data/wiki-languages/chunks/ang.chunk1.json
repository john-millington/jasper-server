prediction of eclipses see saros whose extent duration and appearance depend on the exact apparent diameter of the moon","classification":"ang","name":"Anglo-Saxon","natural":"Ænglisc"},{"value":"the

see the part of the moon that is illuminated by the sun from different angles as the moon traverses its orbit","classification":"ang","name":"Anglo-Saxon","natural":"Ænglisc"},{"value":"so the appearance depends on the position of the moon with respect to the sun as seen from the earth","classification":"ang","name":"Anglo-Saxon","natural":"Ænglisc"},{"value":"because the earth orbits the
