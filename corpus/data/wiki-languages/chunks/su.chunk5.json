particular impedance and capacitance characteristics","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"this is of course not a guarantee that other cables will not work but an indication that nonstandard cables should be used if at all with caution","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"if two devices attach to a single cable one is commonly referred to as a master and the other as a slave","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"the master drive generally appears first when the computer's bios and or operating system enumerates available drives","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"on old bioses 486 era and older the drives are often misleadingly referred to by the bios as c for the master and d for the slave","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"if there is a single device on a cable in most cases it should be configured as master","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"however some hard drives have a special setting called single for this configuration western digital in particular","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"also depending on the hardware and software available a single drive on a cable can work reliably even though configured as the slave drive this configuration is most often seen when a cdrom has a channel to itself","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"a drive setting called cable select was described as optional in ata 1 and has come into fairly widespread use with ata 5 and later","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"a drive set to cable select automatically configures itself as master or slave according to its position on the cable","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"cable select is controlled by pin 28","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"the host adapter grounds this pin if a device sees that the pin is grounded it becomes the master device if it sees that pin 28 is open the device becomes the slave device","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"with the 40-wire cable it was very common to implement cable select by simply cutting this wire between the two device connectors","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"this puts the slave device at the end of the cable and the master on the middle connector","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"this arrangement eventually was standardized in later versions of the specification","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"if there is just one device on the cable this results in an unused stub of cable","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"this is undesirable both for physical convenience and electrical reasons the stub causes signal reflections particularly at higher transfer rates","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"when the 80-wire cable was defined for use with udma4 these details were changed","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"the master device now goes at the end of the cable so if there is only one device on the cable there is no cable stub to cause reflections","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"also cable select is now implemented in the slave device connector usually simply by omitting the contact from the connector body","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"since 80-wire cables require special connectors anyway this was a small additional effort","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"the standard also dictates color coded connectors for easy identification by both installer and cable maker","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"although they are in extremely common use the terms master and slave do not actually appear in current versions of the ata specifications","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"the two devices are correctly referred to as device 0 master and device 1 slave respectively","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"it is a common myth that the master drive arbitrates access to devices on the channel in fact the drivers in the host operating system perform the necessary arbitration and serialization as described in the next section","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"there is therefore no suggestion in the ata protocols that one device has to ask the other if it can use the channel","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"both are really slaves to the driver in the host os","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"the parallel ata protocols up through ata 3 require that once a command has been given to one device on a cable that command must complete before any subsequent command may be given to any device on the cable","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"in other words commands must be serialized with only one command in progress at a time with respect to the ata host interface","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"this function is usually performed by a device driver in the host operating system","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"for example suppose a read operation is in progress on one drive on a given interface cable","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"it is not possible to initiate another command on another drive on the same interface or inform the first drive of additional commands that it should perform later capabilities referred to as overlapped and queued operations respectively until the first drive's read operation completes","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"this is true even though the total i/o time is dominated by seek time and rotational latency and during these phases the first drive is transferring no data","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"a useful mental model is that the host ata interface is busy with the first request for its entire duration and therefore can't be told about another request until the first one is complete","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"the ata 4 and subsequent versions of the specification have included both an overlapped feature set and a queued feature set as optional features","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"however support for these is extremely rare in actual parallel ata products and device drivers","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"by contrast overlapped and queued operations have been common in other storage buses for some time","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"in particular tagged command queuing is characteristic of scsi and this has long been seen as a major advantage of scsi over parallel ata","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"the serial ata standard has supported what it calls native command queueing since its first released version but the feature is only present in a few generally the highest priced serial ata drives","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"it is a common misconception that if two devices of different speed capabilities are on the same cable both will necessarily transfer data at the speed of the slower device","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"this is true only with very old chipsets or add in adapters","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"all modern ata interfaces since at least the late pentium iii and amd k7 era support independent timing which allows each device on the cable to transfer data at its own best speed","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"however due to the omission of both overlapped and queued feature sets from most real world parallel ata products the preceding paragraph must be clarified","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"it applies to the data transfer phase but this is usually the shortest part of a complete read or write operation","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"devices do differ markedly in the total time required to perform an i/o irrespective of the burst data transfer rate and since only one device on a cable can have on operation in progress at one time they do affect each others performance","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"for example consider an optical device such as a dvd rom and a hard drive on the same parallel ata cable","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"with average seek and rotation speeds for such devices a read operation to the dvd rom will take an average of around 100 milliseconds while a typical fast parallel ata hard drive can complete a read or write in less than 10 milliseconds","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"this means that the hard drive if unencumbered could perform more than 100 operations per second and far more than that if only short head movements are involved","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"but since the devices are on the same cable once a read command is given to the dvd rom the hard drive will be inaccessible and idle for as long as it takes the dvd rom to complete its read seek time included","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"frequent accesses to the dvd rom will therefore vastly reduce the maximum throughput available from the hard drive","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"if the dvd rom is kept busy with average duration requests and if the host operating system driver sends commands to the two drives in a strict round robin fashion then the hard drive will be limited to about 10 operations per second while the dvd rom is in use even though the burst data transfers to and from the hard drive still happen at the hard drive's usual speed","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"the impact of this on a system's performance depends on application","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"for example when copying data from an optical drive to a hard drive such as during software installation this effect probably doesn't matter such jobs are necessarily limited by the speed of the optical drive no matter where it is","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"but if the hard drive in question is also expected to provide good throughput for other tasks at the same time it probably should not be on the same cable as the optical drive","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"on the other hand it is worth emphasizing that this effect only occurs if the slow drive is actually being accessed","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"if it is idle its mere presence on the cable will not affect the performance of any other device on the same cable provided of course that the host adapter supports independent timing","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"the following table shows the names of the versions of the ata standards and the transfer modes and rates supported by each","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"note that the transfer rate for each mode for example 66.7 mb/s for udma4 commonly called ultra dma 66 gives its maximum theoretical transfer rate on the cable","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"this is simply two bytes multiplied by the effective clock rate and presumes that every clock cycle is used to transfer end user data","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"in practice of course protocol overhead reduces this value","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"congestion on the host bus to which the ata adapter is attached may also limit the maximum burst transfer rate","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"for example the maximum data transfer rate for conventional pci bus is 133 mb/s and this is shared among all active devices on the bus","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"in addition as of october 2005 no ata hard drives exist capable of measured sustained transfer rates of above 80 mb/s","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"furthermore sustained transfer rate tests do not give realistic throughput expectations for most workloads they use i/o loads specifically designed to encounter almost no delays from seek time or rotational latency","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"hard drive performance under most workloads is limited first and second by those two factors the transfer rate on the bus is a distant third in importance","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"therefore transfer speed limits above 66 mb/s only really affect performance when the hard drive can satisfy all i/o requests by reading from its internal cache - a very unusual situation especially considering that such data is usually already buffered by the operating system","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"in august 2004 sam hopkins and brantley coile of coraid specified a lightweight protocol to carry ata commands over ethernet instead of directly connecting them to a pata host adapter","classification":"su","name":"Sundanese","natural":"Basa Sunda"},{"value":"this permitted the established block protocol to be
