there is no review before modifications are accepted","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"many wikis are open to alteration by the general public without requiring them to register user accounts","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"sometimes logging in for a session is recommended to create a wiki signature cookie for signing edits automatically","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"many edits however can be made in real time and appear almost instantly online","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"this can facilitate abuse of the system","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"private wiki servers require user authentication to edit pages and sometimes even to read them","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"there are many different ways in which wikis have users edit the content","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"ordinarily the structure and formatting of wiki pages are specified with a simplified markup language sometimes known as wikitext","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"for example starting a line of text with an asterisk * is often used to enter it in a bulleted list","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"the style and syntax of wikitexts can vary greatly among wiki implementations some of which also allow html tags","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"the reason for taking this approach is that html with its many cryptic tags is not very legible making it hard to edit","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"wikis therefore favour plain text editing with fewer and simpler conventions than html for indicating style and structure","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"although limiting access to html and cascading style sheets css of wikis limits user ability to alter the structure and formatting of wiki content there are some benefits","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"limited access to css promotes consistency in the look and feel and having javascript disabled prevents a user from implementing code which may limit access for other users","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"quotation above from alice's adventures in wonderland by lewis carroll increasingly wikis are making wysiwyg what you see is what you get editing available to users usually by means of javascript or an activex control that translates graphically entered formatting instructions such as bold and italics into the corresponding html tags or wikitext","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"in those implementations the markup of a newly edited marked up version of the page is generated and submitted to the server transparently and the user is shielded from this technical detail","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"however wysiwyg controls do not always provide all of the features available in wikitext","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"most wikis keep a record of changes made to wiki pages often every version of the page is stored","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"this means that authors can revert to an older version of the page should it be necessary because a mistake has been made or the page has been vandalized","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"many implementations for example mediawiki allow users to supply an edit summary when they edit a page","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"this is a short piece of text usually one line summarizing the changes","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"it is not inserted into the article but is stored along with that revision of the page allowing users to explain what has been done and why this is similar to a log message when committing changes to a revision control system","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"within the text of most pages there are usually a large number of hypertext links to other pages","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"this form of non linear navigation is more native to wiki than structured formalized navigation schemes","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"that said users can also create any number of index or table of contents pages with hierarchical categorization or whatever form of organization they like","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"these may be challenging to maintain by hand as multiple authors create and delete pages in an ad hoc manner","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"wikis generally provide one or more ways to categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"most wikis have a backlink feature which displays all pages that link to a given page","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"it is typical in a wiki to create links to pages that do not yet exist as a way to invite others to share what they know about a subject new to the wiki","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"links are created using a specific syntax the so called link pattern also see curie","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"originally most wikis used camelcase to name pages and create links","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"these are produced by capitalizing words in a phrase and removing the spaces between them the word camelcase is itself an example","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"while camelcase makes linking very easy it also leads to links which are written in a form that deviates from the standard spelling","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"camelcase based wikis are instantly recognizable because they have many links with names such as tableofcontents and beginnerquestions it is possible for a wiki to render the visible anchor for such links pretty by reinserting spaces and possibly also reverting to lower case","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"however this reprocessing of the link to improve the readability of the anchor is limited by the loss of capitalization information caused by camelcase reversal","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"for example richardwagner should be rendered as richard wagner whereas popularmusic should be rendered as popular music there is no easy way to determine which capital letters should remain capitalized","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"as a result many wikis now have free linking using brackets and some disable camelcase by default","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"wikis are generally designed with the philosophy of making it easy to correct mistakes rather than making it difficult to make them","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"thus while wikis are very open they provide a means to verify the validity of recent additions to the body of pages","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"the most prominent on almost every wiki is the recent changes page a specific list numbering recent edits or a list of edits made within a given time frame","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"some wikis can filter the list to remove minor edits and edits made by automatic importing scripts bots","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"from the change log other functions are accessible in most wikis the revision history shows previous page versions and the diff feature highlights the changes between two revisions","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"using the revision history an editor can view and restore a previous version of the article","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"the diff feature can be used to decide whether or not this is necessary","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"a regular wiki user can view the diff of an edit listed on the recent changes page and if it is an unacceptable edit consult the history restoring a previous revision this process is more or less streamlined depending on the wiki software used","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"in case unacceptable edits are missed on the recent changes page some wiki engines provide additional content control","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"it can be monitored to ensure that a page or a set of pages keeps its quality","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"a person willing to maintain pages will be warned of modifications to the pages allowing him or her to verify the validity of new editions quickly","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"most wikis offer at least a title search and sometimes a full text search","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"the scalability of the search depends on whether the wiki engine uses a database","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"indexed database access is necessary for high speed searches on large wikis","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"alternatively external search engines such as google can sometimes be used on wikis with limited searching functions in order to obtain more precise results","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"however a search engine's indexes can be very out of date days weeks or months for many websites","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"wiki software is a type of collaborative software that runs a wiki system allowing web pages to be created and edited using a common web browser","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"it is usually implemented as an application server that runs on one or more web servers","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"the content is stored in a file system and changes to the content are stored in a relational database management system","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"alternatively personal wikis run as a standalone application on a single computer","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"for example wikidpad","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"critics of publicly editable wiki systems argue that these systems could be easily tampered with while proponents argue that the community of users can catch malicious content and correct it","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"lars aronsson a data systems specialist summarizes the controversy as follows most people when they first learn about the wiki concept assume that a web site that can be edited by anybody would soon be rendered useless by destructive input","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"it sounds like offering free spray cans next to a grey concrete wall","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"the only likely outcome would be ugly graffiti and simple tagging and many artistic efforts would not be long lived","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"still it seems to work very well","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"the open philosophy of most wikis allowing anyone to edit content does not ensure that every editor is well meaning","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"vandalism can be a major problem","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"in larger wiki sites such as those run by the wikimedia foundation vandalism can go unnoticed for a period of time","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"wikis by their very nature are susceptible to intentional disruption known as trolling","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"wikis tend to take a soft security approach to the problem of vandalism making damage easy to undo rather than attempting to prevent damage","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"larger wikis often employ sophisticated methods such as bots that automatically identify and revert vandalism and javascript enhancements that show characters that have been added in each edit","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"in this way vandalism can be limited to just minor vandalism or sneaky vandalism where the characters added eliminated are so few that bots do not identify them and users do not pay much attention to them","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"the amount of vandalism a wiki receives depends on how open the wiki is","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"for instance some wikis allow unregistered users identified by their ip addresses to edit content whilst others limit this function to just registered users","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"most wikis allow anonymous editing without an account but give registered users additional editing functions on most wikis becoming a registered user is a short and simple process","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"some wikis require an additional waiting period before gaining access to certain tools","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"for example on the english wikipedia registered users can only rename pages if their account is at least four days old","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"other wikis such as the portuguese wikipedia use an editing requirement instead of a time requirement granting extra tools after the user has made a certain number of edits to prove their trustworthiness and usefulness as an editor","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"basically closed up wikis are more secure and reliable but grow slowly whilst more open wikis grow at a steady rate but result in being an easy target for vandalism","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"a clear example of this would be that of wikipedia and citizendium","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"the first is extremely open allowing anyone with a computer and internet access to edit it making it grow rapidly whilst the latter requires the users real name and a biography of themselves affecting the growth of the wiki but creating an almost vandalism free ambiance","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"many wiki communities are private particularly within enterprises","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"they are often used as internal documentation for in house systems and applications","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"there also exist wikinodes which are pages on wikis that describe related wikis","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"they are usually organized as neighbors and delegates","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"a neighbor wiki is simply a wiki that may discuss similar content or may otherwise be of interest","classification":"ig","name":"Igbo","natural":"Igbo"},{"value":"a delegate wiki is a wiki that agrees to have
