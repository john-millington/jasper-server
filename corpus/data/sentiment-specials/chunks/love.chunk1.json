I found a local parish that was open, and was welcomed inside by a man at the door. He sat in the back pews while I went up front and prayed for the first time in a very long time. After I was done, I asked him if he was the local Father (he had a white buttoned collar on that initially confused me). He said no, but that there were some downstairs I could talk to. We went downstairs and attempted to find one, but a church staff member told us they were all in a meeting, and she pointed us to another church around the corner. The man said he was going that way anyway, introduced himself as Ben, and took me about 5 blocks to the next church. \n\nWe entered it, and again attempted to find a priest. When we went into the basement, we met a Brother who told us that, again, the priests were busy and away. He then pointed us to another parish. Ben told me he was still going in that direction, and offered to take me once more. I was embarrassed and felt guilty for dragging him along with me, but he didn't seem to mind much. He seemed happy a young man like me was interested in church. \n\nWe finally found a small chapel where confessions were offered. I knocked on the confession booths door, and parted ways with Ben, telling him thank you over and over again before going inside. And for the first time in over a decade, I confessed my sins before the Lord. I've never felt so good. I plan on going to mass this Sunday with my father. \n\nIf I'm ever able to, I plan on going to the first parish I found Ben at and telling him thank you again. He walked with me for over 45 minutes before we found what I needed. Please pray for Ben from Boston, as I hope he continues to be as helpful to others as he was to me. "

I can tell myself that she isn't the one, that I'm leaving in a month and even if we stay together it will never be the same, that there's a part of her that is tough to navigate when she doesn't want to tell me when something's wrong. But I love her. I told myself that when I was 13 and I'll tell myself that when I'm 23 or 33 or 43, and it'll mean different things.\n\nI've never been so naked in front of someone, and to be naked is to be vulnerable, it's a vulnerable word. But it never feels that way. Today was our six month anniversary and we spent it in her car. Exploring. But also kissing, and talking. I love talking to her. When she giggles it makes me feel like any time I've ever laughed has been fake, phony, and this is real. She's so stubborn and imaginative and proud and caring. I ask her about sex or clouds or something and we just lie in the folded-up trunk of her Odyssey holding each other.\n\nWhen she drives me home to drop me off I want to tell her that I love her. She holds my face and I hold hers as a song that she likes plays on the radio. There are lights on in my house but I can tell they're all asleep so I close my eyes and think about how soft she is. I tell her I wish she could stay the night and she hums that little hum she makes when she's happy. When I look at her she has tears in her eyes but I don't ask. She doesn't want me to leave. I wonder if she loves me. I wonder if I love her. This has been such a perfect night but there's another day tomorrow and what I tell her isn't enough; \"I really like you\" doesn't put into words all the nights I've spent thinking about how much I care about her, her future, her family, her happiness. We're high school lovers who would skip class to hold each other naked next to someone's farm. She's the only girl I've ever met who is this sweet, the secretly dreamy and starry-eyed black belt future valedictorian. I love her and I want to tell her. Right now she's in her bed down the road, thinking about me. I'll be thinking about [her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCg1Ovu64E)."

The way you guys laughed together, the way you hugged my baby sister, the drink you had with dad. \n\nI remember last new years eve, when you and I got out of the house to go up to dad's party and his friends stopped us to talk to me: the way you stood behind me, letting me have my moment and waiting patiently for me to finish. The way you kept an eye on me through the night, not getting mad at me for spending more time with the other guests, none of whom you knew, than with you. The way you smiled at me like an idiot when you had one too many drinks, the one that I fixed you even after you had turned down a drink from everyone who had offered you one before me. I'll never forget the text you sent me that night after you left. I asked you to text me as soon as you reached home safe. And you replied that you loved me. \n\nI will never forget our first kiss a couple of weeks later, in the corridors of the city's most posh nightclub. We were so drunk that night, the bass was thumping through our bodies, the music loud enough to rattle our brains: the perfect setting for a full blown, alcohol fueled make out session. But that wasn't what happened. Instead, we shared the most chaste kiss I've ever experienced. And no, I'm not counting the one in your car on the way there because both of us were to shocked to realize we even did that.\n\nSpeaking of the car, you singing that horrible, albeit romantic,  Tamil song to me, in my ear will be be most beautiful memory I can possibly hope to have. Or the times we spent driving around the neighborhood aimlessly joking about our \"inevitable\" marriage and how you'd have to put all my potential boyfriends up until then on a leash. \n\nI'll never forget the time I drunk called you in the dead of the night, 2.30a.m. no less, on the last day of my third semester in law school. I told you to come pick me up the next morning, which would mean you had to drive 350kms, all alone, in the rain, well past midnight. And you did. Seeing you pull up into the hostel driveway first thing in the morning was probably the moment I realised I wanted to be with you, no matter what. I still remember you saying you'd call me back, and then follow through on that promise. All you said was I'm on my way, get some sleep. Do you know how special I felt that morning: there were disgruntled parents and drivers waiting for their kids to haul ass out of their rooms in the hostel, and I had you, my hot, tall, muscular you,  waiting patiently for me to finish packing. Oh those looks we got from the others! Priceless. You drove 700kms for me. Overnight and then the morning. I love you so much more for that. \n\nI love that your mum called me when we were sitting at the coffee shop late one night and your phone had died. I love that you and I share so many memories together. The times we've spent walking around the neighborhood just goofing around. Bunking college to meet up and chill. I watched Man of Steel the other day, and didn't remember one scene of the movie. Probably because I was too caught up with you sitting next to me to pay attention to it the first time around. \n\nI will never forget the time you came to see me just because my friends were drunk and I was the sober bored one. And you ended up paying part of the bill and even chaperoning their drunk asses home, for me. They're your friends, and that's all that matters, you said. I'd have married you right that day if I had the chance. \n\nAnd then, things changed. We both met other people. You, by your own admission, hated him, and I kinda hate her a wee bit. Life got in the way. We haven't been able to see each other as much as I would have wished. Now I see you with her and it tears my world apart. I never understood what love was really like, but I felt it for the first time looking in your eyes. And now your hearts been taken and I can't do anything about it. What hurts the most is knowing that it could have been us.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, no matter what happens, no matter who we end up with, no matter where our lives take us, I loved you, I love you, I will always love you. And I pray that one day, some day, we can have a shot at this. Together. "

We would sit next to each other and talk all night about games we'd like to play things we'd like to do etc... I eventually moved in with my friend. He told me before I moved in \"she's everything to me and you better not try anything with her or else.\" I told him nothings going to happen and I meant it. Soon our friendship grew. We became inseparable. We were constantly being mistaken as a couple and we would always correct them that we're just friends. Deep down for me tho it was more than that. Secretly I wanted her. All the time. I would come home from work in the mornings and she would be sitting on the porch smoking, waiting for me to ask me about my day. And she would stay up late each night when I had to switch shifts and I would be home at 2. She grew to be someone I couldn't not have in my life. Who I needed with me by my side. I went on with my life. I dated. Her and my friend eventually broke up after  years. And instead of taking my chance. I pushed her to someone who I thought was would be good. I didn't take my chance....So I obsessed over an ex. I became unable to think straight I would drone on about her and how amazing she was when, now after realizing it wasn't all that great. My best friend was happy though. She loved him and I was too stupid and blind to see how in love with her I was. My friends noticed and said we were perfect for each other. That they have never seen 2 people who were more perfect for one another. I denied it. A few months ago I told her how in love with her I've been, how I couldn't stand her not being in my life, how nobody could ever make me as happy as she makes me. I knew she wouldn't feel the same, but I couldn't keep this secret anymore. Then she surprised me. She told me how she's loved me since the first day she met me. That all she's all she's wanted was to tell me and be with me, but she was scared I would reject her. I didn't know what to do. We just sat there holding each other, finally knowing the truth. Today we are planning a baby, getting married and moving in with each other. I'm ecstatic every day I get to see her. I can't get enough of her. I love my best friend, she's everything to me. :) "

What I'm going to try to identify is that why and how. \n\nThe answer is pretty simple. You have now *officially*, from the highest authority in the land, been placed on the \"wrong side of history.\" That's it. And once you're on the \"wrong side of history,\" your life won't and can't be the same. Not in the West. Now, Catholics are used to this. Being anti-contraception is to be on the \"wrong side of history.\" Or being anti-abortion is too to a degree. But this is actually different. Those are, usually, strictly moral question. Those are different opinions concerning sticky issues. But that's not what this is. How come? Because this is a matter of perceived bigotry.\n\nI can't think of a moment in Church history, in the United States anyway, where it was on the \"wrong side of history\" concerning an issue of perceived bigotry. Not officially. As such, now, to be a Catholic, means to be seen as categorically condemned by society itself *as immoral*. This is the important part. To be a Catholic now means, officially, to be immoral, bad, judgmental, hateful (the worst evils) by society. Not just socially and not just by some portion of society. Legally and officially. And people are usually very shallow and so follow those legal norms, so it will be the vast majority of people who see you this way. \n\nFor priests, this, I imagine, is going to be a huge issue. You're sort of a named enemy of the law and so of society. You don't just have to sell being \"counter-cultural\" now. You have to sell being the counter to the official moral and legal position of the United States. To that, I say, all the best of luck. They're going to compare you to KKK leaders. And not just in the extreme. In the average public imagination, especially, in say, a couple generations. Priests were already on the edge. Now, they're way over the line.\n\nIt is a significant change. It's not the end of the world, but it's a change we haven't really seen before. Not even abortion was as big of a deal socially. (Though it's unquestionably more immoral.) The closest you get to this is the idea that being pro-life means being sexist or anti-woman. But most people don't take this seriously and understand, at least in principle, the idea of being pro-life. Feminists and the like may get behind this. But your average American, not so much. And, of course, no court decision has ever equated being pro-life with having animus toward women, as taking their \"dignity\" from them.\n\nAnyway, always be encouraged. And besides, just getting to be a social martyr for the Lord is a gift very few people get to experience. Remember, sometimes God loves you enough to give you everything. But sometimes, and this is rare, He loves you *so much* that He'll take everything away."

So I clicked the youtube channel to see if the uploader has more videos and I noticed something was off about the priest that uploaded (celebrating mass on a small table by yourself facing a camera screams independent Catholic). So I researched more about this priest and found his \"[church](http://www.holyapostolicchurchofusa.com/)\" website and his [blog](http://edikbaroni.blogspot.com/). This priest was ordained by some \"Ecumenical Catholic Church of Christ\" (orders derive from Thuc line) and still operating as an independent catholic. So I called the Archdiocese of LA (they administer the Coptic Catholic church there) who after some research confirmed my suspicions that this priest was not a canonical priest (they are going to look into the problem more now since they are aware). So this priest for a couple years has tricked this parish into thinking he was canonical even getting so far as to concelebrate with the patriarch and a bishop.\n\nThis is mostly a problem in large dioceses but watch out for people trying to pass themselves off as Catholic priests. Usually they pretend to be visiting priests and talk the group or parish into not following the normal procedures. \n\n*Edit* He deleted all the evidence but if you use the Internet Archive you can see proof"

We  share rationalism skepticism, we think of religion as an idea made by humans. Having said that I know that in USA atheists can be a bit aggressive. Some actions done by atheists I simply disapprove of as for example plastering buses with ads that there is no God. I think it is counterproductive and raelly what do I care if someone believes in God. I know from research that religious people are generally  more happy than atheists and if it makes their lives better I have no problem with others believing in something that I do not believe. If someone believes in Santa Claus is happy that Santa brings him gifts I really have no interest in telling him it is not a Santa it is your neighbor putting gifts on your porch. \n\nBut I write this post not because of some posters on buses. I write it because some people really are persecuted for their religion. I recently heard of a football coach fired for praying on the field. Just as burning people on stakes is barbarianism so is firing them because they publicly preyed. Of course no one any longer kills people for belief but losing a job is still something I do not want to happen to good people.\n\n Just wanted to tell you that I and also many atheists have no problem with people preying. At my workplace people prayed publicly and I was just standing suffering no harm. I know in USA crosses in public places are viewed as not ok but as I come from Poland and attended Catholic University/financed by the government there were crosses in every classroom and no one had problem with them. \n\nHonestly firing someone for prayer is just a !@#$% cruelty. My evangelical friend told me she would not vote for an atheist (as I remember she did not know back than I was one), atheists are one of most hated religious groups in America and knowing some people would consider me to be immoral just because I do not believe in God hurts. \n\nI know that as most of poeple around me are catholics this anti-atheism is not as strong as it is in lets say Alabama. I know I have never suffered persecution because of me being an atheist and if I did I could probably feel some hatred toward religion and religious people. \nWant you to know that not all atheists are against religious people, just as I know that not all Christians or for that matter religious people hate atheists. As I am a Pole I feel a lot of connection with Catholicism despite personally not believing in God. I sometimes tell I am an atheist Catholic (I posted something on this forum about it some time ago)\n\nTo end just wanted to ask you that when you meet an atheist please do not assume this person is immoral or want to persecute you or curtail freedom of religion. There are good atheist, bad atheists, right wing atheist and left wing atheists some atheists are handsome (some like me even very handsome :) some not that much. Just as there are good and bad Catholics.  Please never forget about it.\n\nEDIT - Thanks to all and especially those who gave gold. I appreciate it. "

We have never been more sure of or excited about anything in our lives (seriously, even choosing to get married plagued us with more anxieties and doubts than joining the Church did).\n\nThe first time I received the body and blood of Jesus, my heart was pounding so hard and fast. The gravity of this change and how privileged we are to be part of the Church Christ established is still sinking in. \n\nAll this to say--to those of you who are skeptical about the sacraments, or who think they're not a big deal: I can FEEL the grace from the sacraments. It is INCREDIBLE. I've gone to Mass every day since our Confirmation because I simply don't want to ever miss out on the Eucharist! Our marriage is strengthened, and even our sexual intimacy has been strengthened and feels so BLESSED! I have already gone to Confession twice and love it. It is exactly the kind of sacrament that a girl with a forlorn heart & anxious mind like mine craves. \n\nHow kind of God to provide us with tangible, REAL sacraments to communicate his love to us! Please be encouraged by this. I am so thankful. It is only a miracle of God that I can now say: I would die for His Church. \n\nGlory be to God for leading us here into the Church, and for the amazing people who encouraged us along in our journey. If you think of us, please pray for us--our parents are incredibly hurt and this has caused a lot of division and trouble with mine & my husband's parents. His dad is a PCA pastor and my parents are Reformed Baptists. They are taking it really, really personally (although I don't believe it has to be that personal!) and have asked that we not discuss or debate Catholic issues from here on out. It feels like an impossible situation, and all I know to do is pray. We are praying every day for them to join the Catholic Church :) "

During Thursday\u2019s seminar, we were discussing transcripts in which respondents discuss why they left the church during the 1960s and 1970s. Various reason were given, including gays rights and women\u2019s rights. \n\nOne women in my seminar is a vocal lesbian, and she finished her presentation with: \u201cbut I\u2019m sure everyone here is for them, right?\u201d 'them' being gay people at pride parades. \n\nEveryone verbally or non-verbally agreed, but I didn\u2019t say anything \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to open that can of worms, I just kept my eyes on my notebook.\n\nNow, this girl knows that I\u2019m pro-life due to a previous discussion, she's disliked me since, so when I didn\u2019t respond she asked me directly if I supported gay pride. I said I didn\u2019t, but didn't expand on why (hoping my professor would call for the next presentation to begin before an argument could break out). He didn\u2019t.\n\nI spent about 10 minutes being scolded by two classmates in particular, with others snorting or shaking their heads at me. Eventually, my professor made us move on.\n\nYesterday we had regular class, not a seminar. When I entered the hall, nobody spoke to, smiled at, or acknowledged me. Normally, we all share small-talk before class. After Friday lectures, me and another classmate go to the student union bar for a few drinks, but he left without saying anything to me. \n\nJust an hour ago, I received an e-mail from my professor asking me to see him on Monday to talk about a \u201crecent issue\u201d that was brought to his attention.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m dreading the rest of my semester. I didn\u2019t even choose to announce that I didn\u2019t support gay pride \u2013 I was asked directly, separate from the rest of the class. I feel that my professor should have intervened, but he\u2019s a very liberal man so I know he's going to take their side.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the rant, but I\u2019ve been pacing about my flat since I read his e-mail and I needed to talk about it. I'm somewhere between feeling sorry for myself and being angry at myself for not just keeping my mouth shut. But then, why should I have? Why can't I have an opinion too?  \n\n[UPDATE]\n\nThank you to everyone who took the time to offer advice. I attended the meeting yesterday. The reason I'm updating you belatedly is because I was asked to attend a second meeting today, which I'm just back from. \n\nYesterday I met with my professor alone, where he asked if I would see him again on Tuesday, only this time the girl from my seminar would be present too. He assured me he was not going to \"take sides,\" but that I should \"be more mindful\" of what I say in the future (which he said he also asked my classmate to do).\n\nI met with him again today, this time with my classmate present. She was rude and uncooperative, refusing to shake my hand when I offered it to her as a sort of truce. In the end, my professor said that due to our \"unique circumstances,\" he was not going to force us to interact with one another during seminars, and when my classmate said she was going to pretend I wasn't in the class, my professor said that'll be fine if that's what it will take to avoid any further interruption. \n\nSo, it's settled, I guess. My classmates are still ignoring me, but at least I've not been disciplined. I just want to finish my studies now and get on with life. "

I cant remember what i said, but I made her do more than just smile, i made her blush, and laugh! I moved back to my original seat afterwords, giving her the excuse that \"i didn't like her all by herself over there, and i never saw her smile\" and that \"my work here is done!\". WAY WAY later on, i sat next to her in economics, and we talked, and shared the same interests, but somehow, I felt as if I were making her uncomfortable, so i kept my distance. \n\nAbout a week ago, I got a friend request from her on Facebook, and we started talking a bit more. We decided to hang out last Saturday, and it couldn't have gone better! We smoked the last of my shisha from my hookah, watched How to Train Your Dragon, ate some delicious pizza, and afterwords, laid down, cuddled, and watched Beavis and Butthead on Netflix. She left at about 11:30, and I couldn't stop thinking about her! She was attractive in more than just one way as well! She liked the same music, the same games, the same types of food as me, she was funny, and a thinker. Also, she was driven to do something with herself (career-wise), loved smoking hookah, ALWAYS sweet, and was a very open-minded person.\n\nNow, we always sit next to each other, text each other, hold hands in the hallway, and she kissed me yesterday :D So far, I'm loving every last bit of what's going on. \n\nTL;DR    I talked to a shy girl who always sat alone and never talked to anyone, and now she's opening up, and we are currently together\n\nI swear to god, this is all true\n\nIf anyone actually wants proof, ill post a picture of us tomorrow with a time stamp!\n\nThanks for your time /r/love!"

            "value": "I have felt sad, for so long, and it is not that I am incapable of eating, sleeping, surviving, without you-because I can. I have healed, not yet completely but surely, to make myself whole because I have realized it isn't possible to have a healthy relationship if I am not healthy independently. I have been  running, attending therapy to deal with my anxiety, making amends with my family, focusing on my schoolwork; all the things that I should have done in our relationship for me, yes, but also to have lessened the burden on you. \n\nThe results of this are apparent; I choose kindness when possible, do not take others' time for granted, respond with empathy as the default and judgment is slower to follow. The joy from realizations of this newfound health was temporary, however, as I have realized you can be independent and healthy, but still love someone with all your being. \n\nThe pain from that fact is not fading. \n\nI am sorry, for all the petty fights, for the accumulation of macro and microaggressions over the years. I am sorry that I blamed you when your parents made life tough instead of having realized what a blessing it was that you, someone still living in the rule of your parents and without the independence of college yet, were brave enough to stand up for me time and time again. I am sorry that I blamed you for the people in your life that hurt me when I should have been thankful that you stood by my side, time and again. I was blind to the fact that this hurt you just as much as it hurt me, because all of this was going through you to me, and you were the one really going through it. My anxiety made me blind to all pain but my own, and as I am chipping away at the bits of who anxiety made me become, I have learned this is not who I really am, and not who I wanted to be. \n\nI am sorry for telling you that I wanted you to come to me with anything, and freaking out time and again when you were honest with your feelings. I am sorry that in April, you told me the pain that had been heavy on you for the past six months and I was supportive for a hot second before my anxiety overwhelmed everything and made you choose. I was crippled by my mental health, but that is not an excuse. You were the one going through the pain, and I was selfish and made it about me, time and again. I am sorry that I let my fears dictate our relationship, that I did not trust you or your desires, that you would do the smart and wise thing-it is, above all else, your life and not mine, and I should have been supportive because in retrospect, it would have been so easy. I am so sorry that I made you choose at any point in our relationship. That is not what love should be, and it is not who I am. I knew better, and I am so sorry and in pain that I am realizing this only now. \n\nI do not know exactly what is passing through your mind now, or what your thoughts were then. I wish I did, so perhaps I could gain some more peace from this. We both seem to be in pain, and perhaps it is because you did not want to rub salt in old wounds so you simply said your feelings changed, but what you really meant was this: \"we had a lot of problems, but I always wanted to work through them. This summer, for the first time, I started having my own sadness and grew increasingly hopeless about where the relationship was going because of its unhealthy dynamic, and no longer had the motivation and desire to work them out. Being around you didn't help my sadness for this reason, but saying I just fell out of love with you is an oversimplification and I'm sorry for that, because I miss you and am sad when we speak because I still do have feelings for you, I just reached a point where I was so sad both independently and because of our relationship dynamic that I ended it.\"\n\n Perhaps that is what it is. If so, I hope you accept my apology, and know that I have learned an immeasurable amount from this pain. I miss you, sometimes nearly unbearably. There is no going back, I know-I don't want to go back either and it is always too late to go back-but it is never too late to move forward, and perhaps we could consider moving forward together again. Our foundation is, for all our problems, still one built on a deep friendship and care for one another. I hope we can speak soon and perhaps our growth during this time will help us find our way back to each other as better people.\n\nUntil then, I love you always. "

Now, I know this letter is going to be cheesy as hell, so if whoever else reads this isn't into that, just click the back button and be done with it. NOW, TIME TO BEGIN.\n\nThe first time I met you, you were sort of quiet. Saying something every few minutes. But every time you DID say something, it was funny as hell. Made me giggle. A manly giggle, of course, but giggle nonetheless. After that I only talked to you a few days later. That's when what we call the \"van incident\" happened.. Ahah. After that we got to talking more often, and I noticed that you were an amazing person. I wanted to get to know you better, so I did. I learned you had been having poor luck with some guys (they were idiots to let you go). I think it was then you asked me my opinion on dating with age differences. I told you it honestly, but damn, I don't think I ever wanted to tell you how I felt more than I did right then. But we both know I couldn't... I had a girlfriend at the time. So we continued talking, hung out more often, and I realized how lucky I was to have you as a friend, if not as a girlfriend. Our friend started saying that we were \"totally going to date.\" Ha, when I heard she said that, I made it my goal to make that come true. So I think it was around then that me and my girlfriend at the time broke up.. And I used the worst excuse possible. I was really torn up about that, and you were completely there for me. And then you told me you were considering leaving. So, I decided to fess up and finally tell you how I felt. I was so scared of what your reaction might be. And then you told me you had \"a big o' crush\" on me as well. My heart probably stopped and restarted then. After a few days of our friendship being a tad less friend-y and more love-y, our friend decided to make me ask you out (I was shy as hell and scared to do it). You said yes, and our relationship began. Our friends still call me a romantic for the things I do, but I just feel that it's what a good boyfriend SHOULD be doing. We haven't been together too long but it feels like it's already been forever. You're beautiful, you're one of the nicest people I know, you're funny as hell, and you have a magnetic personality. Oh, and you're damn sexy. I love you."

I understand the idea, but it's never happened to me. Crush is such a simple term, used to merely illustrate a liking for someone. What I feel has no words. \n\nI'm too young for love. Too old for a crush. Too mature to like someone. Too immature to love someone. \n\nIt's teenage romance. The type that can only be captured in cheesy romance YA novels with tragic endings. Even those books can't describe it. They're written by adults who don't remember what teenage love was like. Teenage love is the most impure form of love. In my opinion. \n\nIt is unfiltered, and the people who have it don't understand it. Teenage love is controlled by the raging hormones of a teenager who knows nothing about the world around them. Teenage love is pure emotion, no rational thinking. Some may argue that that is why it is the best, but not for me. Love drives me insane. If I have learned anything about love, it's that love is painful. Especially when it is restrained. \n\nI have no choice in who I love and I'm forced to restrain it, but it's there. I know that if I show my love people will only be confused, because I love differently. I don't feel the desire for a physical relationship. I feel the need for emotional love, for my mind to know what it's like for two people to do anything for each other and always be there. \n\nI have loved before, and I know how painful it is. But I also know the beauty that comes from it. The poetry, the art, the relationships there are out there. \n\nBut I have also seen false love. Those who simply want someone to comfort them and tell them they are good people. \n\nI am losing my sanity to this emotion people call love, and honestly I don't know if I'm glad I am. \n\nI have to either abandon my sanity, or abandon my love. Do I abandon all my rational thoughts and all the hopes I have for the future, or do I indulge in mans greatest treasure and live in the present, where I am now? \n\nI don't know, and the more time I take to think the more I seem to lose my sanity.\u00a0\n\nP.S.

A similar situation is happening to me right now, so I was looking through some things that I wrote, similar to this, but this one really stood out to me so I decided to post it. \n"

I have a story to tell, and it starts out as a pretty great one.\n\nI had this friend when I was a kid.  I'll call her Katie.  Katie and I were best friends, we did everything together when we were 11, 12, 13.  We snuck our mom's cigarettes and alcohol, we went sledding together, we spent basically every spare moment with each other.  We were neighbors in a small apartment building in rural Maine, so there was always a lot of time with nothing going on but our own entertainment.  There was nothing romantic when we were kids, just that special kind of friendship where you trust the other person in the implicit way only a child can manage.\n\nKatie and I grew up poor.  I mean, really just dirt poor.  She lived with her sister and mom, and I lived with my brother and my mom.  By the time we met we had each already moved 14 or 15 times, so that short period of stability was just somehow magically different.  That time period is the happiest of my life, Reddit.\n\nUnfortunately, like so many other good things, it had to come to an end.  My mother unexpectedly moved us one weekend to another town.  Back then internet access was something common folks just didn't really have, so staying in contact wasn't easy.  Shortly after that her mom abandoned she and her sister and subsequently was arrested and imprisoned for several years.  We completely lost track of each other other than memories.\n\nPeriodically over the years as the internet grew and as various services became popular we'd look for each other, but we always missed, until this past October.  She found my Facebook profile (which I'd only recently allowed non-friends-of-friends to send requests to) in October.  We got together to play a game of pool and catch up (it'd been eighteen years at that point, after all).  We stayed longer than we intended, and made plans to go out again.  Long story short, by mid-November we were officially together.\n\nFrom that point I felt like I was living a kind of mid-life fantasy - at 30 I had re-met the woman of my dreams and my best friend, all at once.  The best part?  Neither one of us was in a relationship at the time, neither one of us had been married or even had a recent serious relationship.  I have no children of my own, and while she does have a precocious little boy he seems to like me pretty well and I'm growing pretty attached to him too.\n\nHere's the problem, Reddit.  I'm a single guy.  I've always been a single guy.  Not because I don't dare to ask women out, or because I'm disfigured or unpleasant.  I'm always single because I *enjoy* being single.  I try the relationship thing a few times a year, and I always feel like it was a terrible mistake after a month or so and find myself wishing I was single again - so I make that the case.  Unfortunately this has cause quite a bit of pain to women who don't deserve it over the years.  Each time I feel like maybe this time it'll be different, and each time I end up leaving.\n\nI don't have that feeling yet, but I'm terrified that I will.  I've talked to Katie about my past, and she knows how it's been and wants to try anyway.  I do too.  But what if it *is* the same?  This time it's something serious I could fuck up, something truly precious and rare.  A chance for something people just don't get.  There's her son as well - he's already going to have a tough enough time with a Dad that could give a shit about him; I don't want him to get too attached to me if that's the case either.\n\nUgh."

In my early 20's I looked for you in every man I knew. I even got married thinking it might have been you. It wasn't,  I knew that shortly. And I left and set off to look for you again. My family and friends never quite figured out why I was constantly moving, constantly traveling. Every single time I would get settled down with someone in some place, I would eventually come to know that something was missing. Over the years, I got used to the feeling of knowing I had to pack up and leave because you weren't there. I just hadn't found you yet. Without you, life was great. I had tons of friends, traveled the world and made many memories. But before bed every night, I would think of what it would be like if I was experiencing this with you. Things I knew when looking for you: I knew you would be tall, blonde, blue eyed, in the military, have a great sense  of humor and drive to travel and experience the world like I do. I remember meeting you for the first time. You were exactly how I had always pictured you. Better, even. When we locked eyes, you smiled. I couldn't do much of anything. You were so \"my type\" it was unreal. You walked right over to me and bought a drink. The sexual attraction was there, but when we started talking and laughing, everyone melted away. I don't  remember a single face other than yours that night. You were kind and funny. You got all of my jokes, I got all of yours. We sat on a bench in the middle of downtown talking for hours. Everything was so perfect, I didn't believe it was you. It couldn't be. It was probably some dude just really good at getting women into bed. So, I went home. You called me the next night and insisted we see each other again. And when I saw you that second night, I knew. I knew it was you. I could feel it in every fucking fiber of my being. My whole body was screaming. We talked for hours much like the night before. We got tipsy and went back to your place. We both knew what was going to happen. I've never wanted to make love to someone so much in my life. I just wanted to feel you. We didn't even make it to the bedroom before we got to it. I stopped you mid sex and said \" I'm so glad I've met you. Even if I never see you again and this is all about sex, I'm glad I met you. If you aren't my soulmate, you're damned close. It gives me hope to not stop looking\" I cried, you cried, and we wiped each others tears. We have been inseparable ever since. And it's WAY better than I expected. We've been to the same countries, we hate the same foods, we have the same humor, we have the same dreams, we like to workout together, travel together....and don't get me started on the sex. You are hands down my best friend and soulmate. Tonight, we talked about how even death isn't scary as long as we have each other. I FOUND YOU! And now, we're running away and getting married...just as I had dreamed it. "

A jerk. Time passed and we went on and off, we kissed but we didn t have a relationship, her using the excuse of needing more time. I offered her everything and after aprox 2 months she went to a party and kissed another guy. i somehow forgave her, but after a while she was telling me that she was suffering for this dude now, just so you get it she has something special that i dont know of, i went past it and still waited and waited, we almost got in a relationship and then, a \"friend\" of mine decided to end the sufference and to try and have her so i saw how bad she actually is, he succeded, he dumped her but i was still there, to get her to be with me i made out with a girl at a party and she realised she didnt wanna lose me, after a happy week of a relationship where i decided to choose her over the other girl, she found out that i told that girl i ll never go back to her and know we broke up and she doesnt trust me anymore.

Should we go?  Should we bring our 4 kids?  I'm at the position that maybe my wife could go and I would stay home with the kids.   I don't think we want our children to be confused and also having them think that we condone this type of marital set up by going to the wedding.  Don't get me wrong, it's great that her cousin is happy and all, but we are also concerned that she has lost her spiritual faith in the Church.\n\nWhat's everyone's thoughts on this?  What would your response be?\n\nEDIT:  looks like the pro-gay brigade is in here down-voting valid comments.. I'm also getting a lot of hate messages in my inbox some of which are calling for my family to be killed off.  Not sure why this would happen given that my original post here didn't specifically take a position on what I should do.  Careful out there boys and girls...\n\nThanks"

When he hits the issues hard, there are a small few who have walked out grumbling, even before communion, and we know they have written letters to the chancery.

This day also happened to be her 51st birthday.\n\nGabriel was 8 years old when he passed away.  Although he lived a short life, it was full of love and compassion.  Gabriel suffered from a battery of rare diseases, two of which I will describe to you.\n\nThe main illness from which he was afflicted is known as Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS).  This is a rare congenital heart defect where the left ventricle of the heart is severely underdeveloped.  Gabe also had what is known as Kabuki Syndrome.  This is believed to be a genetic defect with multiple congenital abnormalities and intellectual disabilities.\n\nDespite all of Gabes issues, he was a kid that almost always smiled (except for in front of the camera, that was a little more rare), and rarely was in a bad mood.  Gabe spent over 600 nights in the hospital, most of which my mother tended his side.\n\nIn May of 2011, Gabe was granted a trip to the 'Give Kids The World' (GKTW) village in Florida by the Make-A-Wish (MAW) foundation of South Carolina.  This was the last time I was with Gabe and my family before he passed away.  Here is a video of the trip that my father made: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn2vCDqpAV0\n\nDuring that week, my family experienced the undisputed best time of ALL of our lives.  We were treated like family and given care unparalleled before and since.  Not one penny was lifted from our pockets, as there was no way my family could have afforded any of this trip.  We were given a rental van for the week, we were given a house to stay in, and all meals were provided for.  The pizza delivery guy wouldn't even take a tip!  Not only were we given a place to stay, but the GKTW and MAW groups provided my family with free tickets to go to any and all of the Disney theme parks for our entire stay.  Just so you know, my brother absolutely LOVED Disney.  Mostly the princesses :P  But I can tell you this, he had never smiled as much as he did that week.\n\nThat's not all they did for my family.  Normally the age limit for siblings to participate in these trips is limited to 18 years old.  I was in the Navy at the time and I was also 22 years old.  My sister, Carra, was 20 years old and in college.  The GKTW village made a complete exception and allowed our entire family to attend this monumental event in Gabe's life.  My chain of command and Carra's school also went out of their way to make sure we made it to this trip.  To this day I still am amazed by the love and compassion that was shown to my family during this time.\n\nNone of us knew how little time we had left with Gabe.  If it were not for the GKTW village and the MAW foundation, my family would have never had this wonderful experience and the last memory I would have had with Gabe would have been at the airport six months before he passed away.\n\nGabe was a miracle.  And the way he lived his life showed my family what God is capable of doing for us during times of despair and tragedy.  I also learned what the definition of love is.  It is selfless care for another, without the need for recompense.  I thank God every day for the people at the GKTW village and the MAW foundation.\n\nI just wanted to share this story, the story of Gabe's last days, to let you all know that there is love in this world.  There is good.  And there is a God.  Tragedy will strike in a moments notice, but there is solace in the realization that this life is not the end.\n\nTLDR: My brother Gabe passed away on August 21, 2011.  My family was allowed complete and totally free access to the Give Kids the World Village in Florida, to spend the best week of our lives together.  We had every single cost covered, and we were completely loved by everyone there.  Thank you Give Kids The World, thank you Make-A-Wish, and thank you God for giving us Gabriel Michael Coy.\n\nLinks:\nGive Kids The World: http://www.gktw.org/\nMake-A-Wish: http://www.wish.org/\nGabe's YouTube Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn2vCDqpAV0"

            "value": "I wasn't originally planning on making this post, but a hateful comment left in response to my previous post has inspired me to expand on my thoughts and experience as a gay Catholic. I thought this could be a good teaching moment. The person commenting accused me of being like a \"Jewish Nazi\" and said I was \"f***ing stupid\" for remaining Catholic despite my sexual orientation, which he erroneously believes is diametrically opposed to Catholicism. I want to state first and foremost that that kind of writhing hatred and bigotry is in large part the reason I decided to remain Catholic. Even before I embraced the call to chastity, Christians who knew I was gay were always gracious and loving towards me, treating me with the same dignity and respect they would treat anyone else. Only outside of Christian circles have I personally ever experienced hatred in the truest sense of the word. Of course, that's not to say that all Christians are perfectly loving or that all atheists are hateful. I've known plenty of kind atheists and it would be wrong of me to judge them all based on those that are hateful, just as it's wrong to do likewise with Christians. The idea that Christians hate homosexuals because they don't agree with their lifestyle is an outright lie. \n\nEighth grade was when I first started coming to terms with my attractions. Some of my Catholic school friends whom I confided in suggested I convert to a Protestant faith so that I could have it both ways; live a gay lifestyle and still be considered a practicing Christian. I knew even at that young age that converting was not an option for me, because I realized that changing my religion would not change the objective, unchanging moral truth. I firmly believed then and still believe today that the Catholic Church is THE Church founded by Jesus Christ and handed on to the Apostles in the first century. History and the writings of the early Church Fathers undoubtedly reflect that. To deny that truth in favor of a watered down, corrupted version would be living a lie. I'm a Catholic or I'm nothing. \n\nDespite the conviction I've always had for the Catholic Faith (whether or not I lived it personally), there was a time when I was 17 where I reached somewhat of a crossroads. I had to make a choice between fully embracing my faith or letting it go. Spending my high school years secretly taking in gay coming of age movies and shows like Queer As Folk led me to believe that I would never be truly satisfied or fulfilled in life unless I lived a gay lifestyle. And I fell for it. So at 17, I came out to my parents with the intention of leading a gay lifestyle. They were shaken up by it and unsure how to react, but were never unloving. After a few months, they asked me if I would be willing to meet with our pastor just so I could talk with him and I unenthusiastically agreed. At our first meeting, I didn't say much, but I made it clear that 1) I knew what the Church's teachings were, 2) I knew what I *should* do as a Catholic,  3) I didn't care, and 4) I wanted to be sexually active regardless of what anyone said (my brattiness at that meeting was premeditated). So laying all that out, he realized he wasn't going to change my mind and said \"I don't want you to misconstrue this as me condoning your choice, BUT if you do have sex, do so safely and don't do anything to put your life or your health in danger. I don't want to find out that anything bad has happened to you.\" He reassured me that no sin is too large to make reconciliation with God impossible and that no matter what I did to keep praying through it all.\n\nThat moment really transformed my heart. Father showed me unconditional love like I had never seen before. Even though I intended to go against Christ and the Church, he never stopped showing concern for both my spiritual AND physical well-being. That was something I had never really experienced in the secular world before. If an ordinary man can show me that much love regardless of my actions, it's hard to even fathom how much more Christ must love us and desire us. I was so moved that shortly after, I did choose a celibate life. I realized that Christ's Church does have my best interest in mind, not only because she holds more wisdom and insight than any other institution in human history, but because the Holy Spirit has never stopped guiding the Church and wants to reside within me. And by the way, my pastor has been my spiritual director for the last four years now and he's helped me grow in ways I cannot even describe. I feel like a different person. He's helped me become confident, articulate, grow in charity and chastity, and most importantly, grow closer to Christ in my prayer life. My life has so much more meaning and direction now that I strive to seek the will of God in all that I do. \n\nIt's funny; I had all that knowledge of God and the Church's teachings and I knew the apologetics behind the Faith, yet at the time, none of it mattered to me. It took that one small act of unconditional love from my pastor to make it all click. It goes to show how absolutely necessary love is in proclaiming the Faith. I will never forget that lesson.\n\nAll of that said, people can say whatever uncharitable things they want about me. It isn't the most pleasant thing to deal with, but I think it's an honor to be hated for Jesus Christ. At the end of the day, that hatred is exactly what constantly reassures me that I've made the right decision in choosing to embrace my Catholic Faith over a worldly life. Nothing can compare to the eternal love found in Christ or the love I've received from my brothers and sisters in His Church (whether I've been worthy of it or not). \n\nThank you for listening and God bless!\n\n"

By the start of this year, she came to talk to me, and for some reason, i just ignored her, she seemed to not remember all the immature thing after all, but i did. We stopped talking to each other for 7 months, until now. \n\nThis year i passed by great changes in my life, improving myself and this kind of stuff. Because of this, i just woke up to my acts, i started thinking about this, about her. I just realized that i threw up that good love/friendship in the trashcan. This just made me love her, those feelings i had before just came back. I started talking to her again, but not at the same amount as we did 2 years ago.\n\n(I'm really confused, i don't know if this text is making any sense.)\n\nI can't really tell you if she cares about me, if she loved me, if she loves me, if she consider me her friend, i don't, i can't even tell if she ever cared about me. \n\nI only know, that the love i felt from her just came back, from the shadows, from the deepest places of my mind, to haunt me. \n\nI had to get this out of my chest.

I should probably have waited to say that \"I love you\" for a later date. \n\tI had been thinking that I felt it, but that I was definitely going to wait and say it, at least wait a month or two at minimum. But then the whole thing happened where you kind of said it and it was kind of weird, and y'know I really don't remember every word of the conversation but I remember asking you if it would be weird if I felt the same way, and you said no. I still didn't say it though. Later on the next week when you were upset, you said that no one LOVED you. There was a short moment of silence, probably only a second or two but a thousand things played in my mind trying to decide if I should say it or not, so I took a chance and said it.\nI'm sorry if that freaks you out, I don't want to be the guy who comes on too strong. And I get it, we're moving really fast. Let's just slow down, take the time to get to know each other more. I still want to be together, have a relationship, but we can absolutely slow it down.\n\tNow here I am wondering if that can even happen. You seem so upset and torn in your decisions, I don't want to be the one to make you feel that way. So we can just end it if you want. Pretend it never happened, I'm testing out of our class together anyway so you won't even have to see me. If that's what would make you happy, say the word and we'll do it.\nI just don't want that. I don't want to be the guy who makes you feel torn and upset. I want to be the guy that you can talk to about anything, be comfortable with, and share your life with. I LOVE YOU THOUGH. WHY IS THAT SUCH A BAD THING? Why does it make someone freak out when someone cares deeply for them? Why is that something to run away from and NOT KNOW IF YOU WANT? Would you rather have someone who doesn't care about you? Who beats you and is a fucking alcoholic loser? Or is it just me? WHAT THE FUCK. OH MY GOD I'M SO FUCKING MISERABLE WITH THIS SHIT. WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST FUCKING SAY IT WAS TOO EARLY TO SAY THAT YOU LOVED ME TOO AND IT COULD HAVE STOPPED THERE.\n\tSomeone told me that they think you have feelings for someone else, or that you're sleeping with someone else. I told them they were full of shit. I know you aren't sleeping with anyone else, but it did make me wonder if you had feelings for someone else. I think you still have feelings for your ex. Fuck your ex, he sounds like a piece of shit. A guy with 10x the problems I have, hell, 100x, or a 1000x the problems I have. All the shit that you've told me, how could you have ever even looked at him twice? Much less spend that much time with him? God. What's my biggest problem? That I fucking care too much? Oh my god fucking run as far away from me as you can because I fucking care about you. Fuck my life.\nI seriously hate my life. I'm miserable as shit. The one good thing I had, you, is probably breaking up with me. I can face it now, you want to break up with me, but you don't know how to do it and you don't want to hurt me. I can understand that, I'm a nice guy and you hate to be the BITCH THAT BREAKS HIS FUCKING HEART, but what can you do right? He cares about you a lot so you better ditch his ass QUICK.\n\tI'm so sick of this. Why can't you just care about me back? Are you fucking made a stone? What is wrong with people. I get you have problems from the past, and so do I, but I'm not the one acting scared of someone caring about me. Whatever. I guess this is it, it's probably over. I hope you have a good life with your kids. Maybe you can get back together with your first love. maybe he can make you happy, and for whatever it's worth, that's all I really even wanted."

Dad told mom he would leave her if she did. \n\nBoom. Miracle baby McCHitman is born. She was told that I wouldn't walk. Boom. Beat those odds. \n\nDad passed away when I was 10 and it changed everything. I slept in the same bed as mom, for security. Hers and mine. \n\nThe day I turned 16 I put an application in at Arby's with the sole purpose of helping mom with bills. I had to take care of my mom. I worked full time since. No time for school because I wanted to work and help mom. \n\nWhen I bought my first house mom moved in right along with me. It would have been easy to move on with life, but what kind of life would mom have had alone and barely making it? It made since for us to be ok together. The thought of splitting up from her never crossed my mind. \n\nIn 2009 when mom got diagnosed with cancer for the 4th time, it cemented our bond as the worlds greatest tag team. I spent that entire year laid off of work by the Grace of God. I applied to a minimum of 10 jobs a week for an entire year. I had 1 interview the whole time. God had a plan. Lay me off, because mom is going to need me. \n\nThat year was rough but she overcame so many odds. They didn't expect her to make it after those treatments did her so bad. Radiation is actually the reason for the current problems. Cancer is and has been the least of the problems. \n\nThat year brought us closer than ever. As I was her physically rock, she was mine. I've never seen someone fight so hard and I don't think I ever will again. People really don't understand everything she has been through in this life and she comes out with a smile on her face most of the time. \n\nShe introduced me to my faith and showed me dedication. She would read her bible every morning. She instilled values and work ethic into me, that I hopefully pass on. \n\nShe always supported me and was proud of me. She may not have liked things like my wrestling career but she was at every show. EVERY SHOW. she was my biggest fan, and the one that wanted me to stop at the same time. \n\nMom has been the constant in my life for nearly 33 years. That's the entire time I've been alive. Through the years there have been things that kept me from seeing her each day, but not a single day has gone by in 33 years where I didn't speak to my mom and hear her voice. Not a single one. \n\nThat's a really long time. 33 years of her loving voice comforting me, laughing, crying, asking me about my day and telling me about hers. \nMe saying \"yo\" her answering \"hey hey\". I say \"what's up\" she says \"nadda nadda\"\n\nMe kissing her on the cheek, her blowing me kisses when I left. I favor her right cheek. \"Kiss my nose woman!\"\n\nMom is my best friend. I like her. It's impossible for her not to be. She's my Mom. She is THE Mom. It's nothing against the other moms out there but it's impossible for you to compare. \n\nI love you Mom, always have, and always will."

There is one relationship in particular that I truly thought that this was it: I found my soulmate. This man did everything keeping my needs in mind. He never took a step without thinking about whether I wanted him to take it. He would argue with me when I felt argumentative, he'd make love to me when he knew I wanted to make love. When I looked in his eyes I saw everything that I needed: my mom liked him, for cripes sake. \nThe only problem was, I still felt like something was missing. It happened mostly when he did little things that annoyed me: there were certain words that he pronounced wrong. There was this way he washed he dishes that made my hair stand on end. He told me he \"never smokes\" but I caught him with pot twice (I didn't really care that he smoked, it was the lying). None of these things are a \"good reason\" to breakup with someone, truly.BUT- something felt off. I just fell out of it. He would try to talk to me about the future, and all I could do was wince and pull out of his arms. I broke up with him seemingly out of nowhere after dates for over two years. It's been over a year since that relationship, and through determination and a promise to myself to avoid the dating scene like that plague, I got my dream job, an apartment, and a newfound self respect. Maybe it's because I am independent now and I have a new love for myself that made me more accepting of true love, but I would like to describe what I'm feeling-\nWhen his BO is the best smell in the world.\nWhen he's driving and you stare at him for an hour, and you don't realize an hour has passed.\nWhen you fall asleep in the crook of his arm and have vivied dreams about what it will be like to wake up and see sunlight on his face.\nWhen he leaves for work for a couple weeks so you stockpile old shirts of his to sleep in.\nwhen you hug him goodbye and you hear \"humphhhh\" and his body sags into your hair and your neck, and neither of you move or say a word.\nWhen you're showering together and the only he's staring at is your eyes.\nWhen you go on a tangent about your probably boring job, realize you might be being boring but he tells you it's okay and to keep going.\nWhen you want to learn everything about his job so you can imagine him doing even the most boring of tasks.\nWhen you go through your day and every new thing that happens you wonder how he would react.\nWhen you can be total dicks to each other and neither of you actually gets mad.\nWhen you both get drunk at the bar, and the walk home is an Alice-in-Wonderland type adventure. \nWhen he sees you sloppy drunk at the bar and is simply there to make sure you don't hurt yourself on your two left feet.\nWhen most of your jokes together turn into such well-rehearsed inside jokes that all you have to do is look at him and you both can't help but crack up. \nWhen you have bad anxiety problems but he can end an attack just by holding you or giving you that \"now what stupid thing are you panicking about now\" face.\nWhen you fall asleep for a minute, and wake back up to him watching you sleep and playing with that cowlick in your hair that you now love because he loves to play with it. \nWhen cooking breakfast turns into a food fight.\nWhen it feels more like he's your best friend than heis your boyfriend.\nWhen there's that look in his eyes that says he'd tear down mountains just to make you happy, not because he's trying to look that way, just because it happens. Both of you were trying to avoid love, anyways. It only makes sense that you can only find true love when you're not looking for it, because it means that everything that happens to the two of you is something neither of you could control but so incredible that you let it happen.\nThis to me is true love, because he doesn't keep me in mind with every step. He doesn't do things when I want him to, and vice versa. Sometimes I'm feeling argumentative and he wants to make love. Sometimes we drive each other crazy with things we've already pointed out that we don't like that each other does- and sometimes they're not little things, like how he washes the dishes. The funny thing is, though, is that we simply coexist as ourselves and somehow our coexistence fits so wonderfully together that it feels as obvious as the grass is green that we are in love. \nI hope I explained that well without sounding too cheesy, and if I sounded cheesy I'm sorry there was no forewarning of the impending cheesiness of this post."

Now I\u2019m not na\u00efve enough to say it was love at first site, but once I saw her dimples I knew I was done. Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that this one person would change my life so much. Anyone that knows me knows how much I've changed because of her, all changes for the better. For the first time in my life I was able to love someone else and care more about them than I did myself. If it wasn't for her there's no way I could sit and write her this letter. No way in hell I'd be able to spill my heart for anyone to see. Out of all of the girls I ever dated she was the only one I ever wanted to introduce to my friends. And with no surprise, the all gravitated towards her and truly adored her, and still adore her. I'm just sorry I didn't introduce her with more pride. She deserved for me to stand on the highest of mountains and let everybody know what she meant to me. There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do to put a smile in her face. Nothing I wouldn't give to ensure she never has to endure any pain.\nNot til it was too late was I finally man enough to let her know how I really felt about her and what she meant to me. How she's easily the most beautiful woman I've ever encountered in my life, not just physically, but emotionally as well. How I loved her with every fiber of my being. She had the purest of hearts. A heart that was capable of more love than I ever thought was humanly possible. Never has anyone ever brought so much joy to my life. She had a smile to kill for. No matter how bad my day was going or regardless of how mad I was, her smile was enough to turn my whole day around. That\u2019s the reason I went out of my way every day to make sure I see her. She was the backbone that held me up with each passing day. And though she might not have known it at the time, she was always there when I needed her more. Ask me what I want in a girlfriend and I\u2019ll tell you I don\u2019t know, but she had it all. She was all I could have asked for, and more. She was far more than I ever deserved, and more than I will ever deserve. As a matter of fact, more than any guy will ever deserve. God obviously blessed me with a treasure far greater than I could handle. I've never been a believer in marriage, and I'm still not, but not in a million years did I ever picture spending the rest of my life without her in it. I won the lottery, but managed to squander it all away. Now I must learn to live life all over again.\nI have no one to blame but myself. It\u2019s my fault she never knew. How she never knew what she truly meant to me. And every day I hate myself for that. She didn\u2019t know that when she found me I was a broken man, and how she made me whole again. She doesn't know I took this job to buy her whatever she wants, although she\u2019s never asked me for anything. She never knew of the job offers from around the country/world I rejected, simply so I would never have to leave her side. She never knew how at times she was the only thing right in my life. She never knew about the time I was certain I had cancer. Or the countless nights I stayed up scared. Not so much of dying, but afraid of abandoning her and breaking her heart. She's clueless about how every day I pray to god that he brings her back to me, even though I've never prayed for anything in my entire existence. And how my heart skips a beat every time my phone goes off hoping it's her, but it never is. She has no idea about how I cry at the thought of her. And do so for two hours every day as I drive home, to the point where my heart aches to where I think it's going to finally give. If she could see me now she\u2019d know I\u2019m now simply a shell of my former self. I might look bigger and stronger, but never have I been weaker and more vulnerable in my adult life.\nShe has no idea how much it hurts me to write this. I'm forever thankful for having her in my life and every day I struggle with myself to not be bitter, to not resent her and instead be grateful. But as of now it's a struggle I'm losing. Maybe with due time I'll move on. But it's fair to say she's ruined it for every other girl. For I simply don't see myself loving anyone else the way I loved her, and quite honestly, I don't see anyone else loving her as much as I loved her. And how she will forever be the litmus test upon which every girl will be measured against. And Because of her, girls will be held to standards I know they'll never meet.\nI'm not going to say goodbye, because in my heart I don't believe this journey is truly over.\nI loved you yesterday. I love you today. And I'll always love you tomorrow."

We love it. We want to join the Church so badly. We've finally decided to tell our families, because we know at this point we could never go back to the Protestant church, and we certainly know we do not want to die without becoming Catholic.\n\nMy husband's father is a PCA pastor, and they are good and kind people. They have responded graciously after we told them, albeit a bit awkward and uncomfortable at the moment. In time, I hope, it will be less of a point of tension.\n\nWhat I have a particularly hard time with is my parents. They were both raised Catholic and left the faith in their teens, finding it lacking in ways that I forget (they didn't talk about it much). My stepfather absolutely hates the Catholic Church. I am not sure how he was burned by it, but I know his vehement opposition of it comes from a place of deep hurt, which comes out as anger (comparable to Jack Chick's condemnation of Catholics & his wildly uninformed caricatures of them).\n\nI am very afraid of him. He is a sad, troubled man and I have never had a good or loving close relationship with him. I am having a hard time remembering why my husband and I are doing this, joining the Church. When we are back in our home and go to Mass, it is the only place we want to be, and we cannot wait to join the Church. I just fear my mom and stepdad's reactions and weird reasoning so much and I just don't know how to talk to them. They think my husband is a wolf in sheep's clothing leading me astray.\n\nThings feel messy and unclear, and being back here with our parents as we \"dropped this bomb\" is so uncomfortable to me. I want to shrink into a hole and not have to explain the very complex and numerous reasons we've decided to become Catholic. They don't understand it, and it's hard not to have anyone around who understands why we're becoming Catholic (not even our Protestant friends are sure how to talk to us anymore).\n\nPlease pray for us, and for me. It is hard to remember why we're doing this and it feels very lonely and uncomfortable. I have a particularly sensitive spirit (I hate people questioning and disagreeing or opposing me, I tend to crumble). I would love any encouragement or similar stories--you have no idea how comforting they would be right now.\n\nHave a blessed Advent, folks. \n\n\n****EDIT: We send both of them an email letting them know this past weekend. We know the timing is rough, but we thought it would be very difficult to continue to keep this a secret. We went to lunch today and spoke extensively with my husband's parents, who are heartbroken at our decision, of course. My parents have yet to respond but are communicating with my husband's parents behind our backs. We know they are both hurting extremely from this.\n\n***We felt it was right and good to tell our parents now (although of course telling them around Christmas is so not ideal) because my husband's dad is a PCA pastor, the topic of where we will go to church on Christmas and Christmas Eve would come up. In hindsight, I suppose we could've kept it a secret and just gone to Mass on Christmas Eve at Midnight, and go to his dad's church Christmas morning (which is what we're doing), but it became increasingly difficult to keep this a secret from them since we are fairly close to them.\n\nTLDR: Have family members not happy with our decision to become Catholic. I am very afraid of the road ahead of us, and would love prayer and/or encouraging stories of making it through this phase."

            "value": "Hello! I'm seeking advice on Catholic views regarding several, what I deem, problematic points of doctrine within the Catholic Church. I am a Methodist, which is a denomination of Christianity that lies somewhere between Catholicism and Protestantism. I have been studying Catholicism for a bit now and there are many points I have come to agree, rather reluctantly, and some points I take great issue with. Lets begin with those I tend to agree with:\n\n1: Something very misunderstood in most Non-Catholic Christian circles is the Catholic understanding Saints, Mary, and prayer. In preparation for All Saints Day, in which Methodists honor \"All\" Christians passed, I did studying on why Catholics \"prayed\" to saints. It made little sense to me until I truly put two-and-two together and realized that we hold true the fact that Christians in Heaven are Alive! ALIVE! Yes, so that is one point I have begun, very slowly, to adopt into my personal walk.\n\n2: As a United Methodist, I understand the use and sometime need of hierarchy. The UMC has a hierarchy of Local Pastors, Elders and Bishops. Therefore the hierarchy of the Catholic Church bothers me much less than say, a Southern Baptist. However, as I will explain shortly, I take issue with \"how\" the hierarchy is expressed.\n\n3: I find no fault in public or private confession. We Methodist use Confession in our Communion services (similar to Mass). The problem, as I will show, lies mainly with the Catholic impression that this confession be done with a priest, whose station I do not fully understand or accept.\n\nMy current issues that I struggle with\n\n1: Why are priests, bishops, cardinals, and the Bishop of Rome (the Pope), set apart from other believers? And in the station of the Pope, how can his interpretation of scripture and doctrine be infallible? Is the Pope not human as we all are, subject to the same sin? I understand he is not infallible in his judgements of worldly things and can make mistakes, etc etc, but how can he be infallible when it comes to decrees?\n\n2: I have often heard Catholics do not view their Christian faith as having a \"personal relationship\" with Jesus Christ. In Protestantism and well as my own United Methodist theology, it is of the upmost concern that you have a personal relationship, a daily communion with Jesus Christ, in prayer, thanksgiving and obedience. Why do Catholics shrug this idea off?\n\n3:Why is the sacrament of the Eucharist so integral to the Church? Is it necessary for Salvation? Does not the Scriptures say we are saved through faith and not of works? I will add that this is a point I am working on with myself when it comes to Baptism.\n\n4: Do Catholics still believe in Purgatory? I have heard it said that purgatory is like the road you take getting to Heaven, there is unfinished business, so to say. Do all believers go to purgatory? What about the man on the cross beside Jesus, who was told he would be with Christ in Heaven that very day? Also, does the church still believe that those living on Earth can pray to relieve the burden on those in Purgatory?\n\n5: Celibacy for priests, I seriously do not understand it.\n\n6: Do Catholics still hold to Transubstantiation?\n\n7: Do Catholics view other Christians as, well, Christian? And if not, why? What is the criteria? I have heard something of being in full connection, and in part connection with the Catholic Church but I don't fully understand.\n\nIf I could please receive some well meaning and thought out feedback, with good sources, I would love to talk more. I am very intrigued and wish to learn more about Catholicism."

(she went to spain to work for an hotel as an apprentice) \n\nAfter 2 years of not even kissing a girl i have found her. I asked her out on a date and guess what, it was amazing. We talked for 4 hours straight. I felt like she is something special and pushed for another date. Some days later we went to her place and again we talked for several hours. When i talked and she just sat there looking me in the eyes like i was telling  the best stories she has ever heard. She was interested in everything i said and respected every opinion i had. Honestly, i was able to be myself for the very first time and she loves me just the way i am. What a feeling. I felt so secure when i was with her but she told me she is going to america for a whole year in less then 2 weeks. \nWell damn, i fell in love with her knowing that she will be gone for a whole year. Now i had to decide whether or not i fully commit to loving her or not (if that makes any sense). And guess what i did, we kissed and just looked eachother in the eyes until 5 in the morning. It felt like i found my soulmate. There wasn't one thing she disliked about me or my thinking neither did i dislike anything she did. I am convinced that she is the one, even if it sounds stupid. She accepts the way i am, and that's the most beautiful thing on earth, i tell you. \n\nBut we had to talk about what will happen when she is gone and oh boy, it broke my heart. She said: 'you made me fall in love with you in less then 10 hours, i can't imagine what had happened if we met before. But i just cannot have a boyfriend right now, i can't handle a long distance relationship.' \nWhich is understandable, i can't either. I know she loves me and she knows that i love her but we just can't be together. I wish i could just skip one year of my life just to be with her again. \nI am so afraid that when she comes back we will not be able to built up that synergy again, thinking of that right now straight up kills me. I want her in my life but i am scared that she will forget me or just stop loving me during that time. I have never been this sad. But you know what? I just want her to be happy even if this means that she stops loving me and moves on. Even if she finds another guy, as long as she is happy, i will be fine somehow. I'm praying everyday for her to be happy and healthy, i found the love of my life!"

When water and earth come face to face.. And then I saw.. A curving light.. Around your face was a silver lining.. It was your smile that always kept shining.. You sat with me like you always did.. Our heads resting on the other.. You turn around to give me a kiss.. I opened my eyes and guess what I miss.. I see nothing around me.. Not even you.. You were the shadow that I once knew..\n\n(End of poem)\n\nI wrote this to the girl I loved days before she got married to someone else."

Despite my parents misgivings, I decided to go ahead of my journey to become a Catholic. However, I did feel guilty about it, and did continue to question and pray for guidance and if I was indeed doing the right thing.\n\nLast night, both of my parents told me that they are fully supportive of me becoming Catholic. My dad, who is a Lutheran pastor, called the Catholic priest in my hometown and talked with him. He said that the priest told him that there are ways for him to participate in some form in both my wedding and in the baptism of my children- I'm not really sure what those ways are, but speaking with the priest gave my dad a lot of comfort and peace in accepting my decision. \n\nMy mother is also very supportive. While she will be sad not to commune with me anymore, she has seen the peace and hope that belonging to this faith community has given me. She has always prayed that I would find a faith to be at home in, and she said that she realized that the Catholic church is my spiritual home, and that she is so thankful for that. They have encouraged me to get more involved not only through RCIA, but through Bible studies and young adult groups, and I plan on doing that. \n\nBefore Mass, I always take a few minutes to pray about things that are on my mind, and I thanked God for guiding both my parents and me through this journey, and to continue to be with all of us. Now I feel truly ready to start my journey into Catholicism without any guilt or trepidation! Thank you to those of you who have also prayed for me and my parents throughout this time- it truly means so much, and it is really a testament to the power of faith and prayer."

Long story short, she is incredibly beautiful (blonde hair, semi-athletic looking but no longer does sports, could potentially outdrink me (this is a true feat since I am a big man (240 lbs, but only 17% body fat, so not fat)).\nAnyway, she comes over about an hour before a party at my place starts. We immediately make some hefty rum and cokes and start talking. About 10 people come and we end up going into my bedroom to continue the conversation and sit in chairs (no, not the bed). As we talk, we get closer, knees touching, hand on leg while laughing sort of thing. She leaves to go get another drink and drags her hand across my shoulder when she leaves.\nWhen she returns we chat for a bit more. Talk about future plans and somehow we got on the large dreams part (involving politics) and I mentioned that I am considering making a run for President after a hopefully successful business career (I'm 22, you have time to prepare America) and she is interested in becoming a high-level energy officianado. So of course I start calling her \"my energy advisor\". She says something witty and I pull her over to my lap and she says \"oh so this is like the Clinton administration?\" and then we proceed to kiss and make out (but sweet and meaningful, not the sloppy kind). I have never had my breath taken away like that before.\nUnfortunately she had to leave an hour later to go to her dads for the weekend, but we have a lunch date planned for Tuesday and a date planned for Friday night.\nMind you this is all after I've been single for 2 years and have been avoiding getting in a relationship so I don't have deal with separating because of graduation.

I was quite confident after seeing my parent's marriage, I would never get married and spare myself that misery. \n\nWhen I met the first person I fell in love with, he was the last person I'd ever expect to date. After a surprising and unexpected kiss, we ended up dating for three and a half years and my stance on marriage and love in general changed. Love was possible, even for a broken person like myself. I can't count the times we laughed and danced together, loving each others company. I saw myself having a family with him. He loved children. He was free-spirited and carefree. He seemed to love life. \n\nBut, as life dictates, things must change. He became quiet, secretive, and would wave off any problem I felt we needed to discuss. After supporting him after failing out of school, getting a DUI, and even sexually assaulting me, the straw that broke the camel's back after all that time was him not willing to talk through any issue. After countless nights of crying myself to sleep, thinking back on the wonderful times we had, and even doubting my own discomfort after being held down and forcibly fucked without my consent, I walked. I had grieved toward the end enough and it wasn't as heartbreaking as one would assume after being with your first love for that long. \n\nMy mother would always tell me that it's okay to end it if you don't think its right. She said there are many men to meet and many will treat you just as well, if not better. I never took much stock in my mothers words when I was younger, as young people often do. But she was right. I did meet someone. \n\nI met him at a bar, going out with co-workers, enjoying single life and freedom. I knew him previously. He was in the same program as me when I took that major at college and worked at the liquor store so he sold me booze a handful of times. We were re-introduced by my co-worker who went to high school many moons ago with him, and we commenced talking. We had both taken Japanese in school and drunkingly spoke to each other in it. My co-workers eventually left me alone, seeing that I was preoccupied. I was.\n\nAs cynical, broken, and reluctant as I was after that first love, I took a plunge because what did I really have to lose? It worked out. No one has been more tender, sweet, endearing, and thoughtful as this man has. His eyes sparkle when he laughs. He looks at me with such tenderness that it melts my heart. He carried a desk someone left on a curb because he knew I needed one without being asked.  I sprained my ankle and he took it on himself to carry me up and down my stairs in my apartment building. He's done my laundry because it was his day off and he simply could. \n\nI am sorry I am gushing, r/love. I'm just over the moon. I have this great urge to explain my happiness. We've been dating for a few months now and I am still astonished by how good this man is and how I fell for him. I want to be just as good to him as he is to me. \n\nHere's some words of hope to those who split with a serious partner: It gets better. It does, trust me. And oftentimes, it works even better than you expected. Keep your chin up. "

You would go days on end without really talking to me.

You tell me everything I want to hear, yet, I know we are not right for each other, and you are still not mature enough for the relationship I wish we had. When you left, I cried so much... I still cry. Every time I leave after traveling the distance to see you, every time I hear a song that reminds me about you, us...

His actions and words usually indicate the opposite (such as when he told a man in a gay relationship it was acceptable for him to kiss his romantic partner on the lips during the sign of peace). The reason schismatic and cafeteria Catholics are drawn to him is because they believe his aim is to change the Church's teachings, because that's exactly what he's led them to believe. Why else would schismatic New Ways Ministry give him an award? \n\nWhen I met my best friend I didn't have any kind of ulterior motive in befriending him. We bonded mainly because we both picked up on the fact that we were of the same sexual orientation and our friendship deepened from there. As such, he soon learned I was a devout Catholic (and he considered himself \"new age\" at the time). As any meaningful friendship goes, we didn't hide our thoughts and beliefs from each other for fear of coming off as preachy. If he asked me about relationships, I told him without beating around the bush or fear of being seen as \"rigid\" that I didn't believe in same sex relationships, because XYZ. Contrary to what James Martin claims, our ability to be loving and have a dialogue is not limited by professing our orthodox Christian beliefs to others. The opposite is true. Our ability to be loving and hold a dialogue is expanded by professing our Faith to those we care about. Otherwise, you aren't really loving them, you're just paying them lip service. So after months of conversation, my friend decided he also wanted to lead a celibate life and was received into the Church earlier this year.  \n\nHiding, watering down, and apologizing for your Faith isn't how you lead souls to Christ; living your Faith in its fullness is.

We were lab partners in organic chemistry, worked together as RA's and at the front desk at the mailroom on-campus. We bantered and joked and walked up from class together. We spent 6 hours a week or so at the least between class, work and lab together and we were and are great friends.\n\nA few weeks ago, I went to look at an apartment for the summer. My boyfriend couldn't go so my lab partner went with me. He jokingly suggested we pretend to be a couple when we went to check out the house and I took him to dinner afterwards as a thank you. We didn't know then but that's when it all started. Of course we had fun at dinner because we were friends, and that was all. \n\nThen, we played with an Ouija board, just the two of us, again just as friends out of curiosity. Only, after we'd fully freaked each other out, he said \"you know, now would be the perfect time to make a move if we liked each other.\" But I still didn't see him that way, and I thought it was probably the adrenaline tricking me into liking him a little more than usual. He came to a party that my [now ex] boyfriend and I were throwing for St. Patrick's Day and we were attached all night, couldn't stop talking. Drunk gossiping about friends and past relationships, that's the night that we actually started to fall in love but problem, I have a boyfriend who I thought that I loved very much. \n\nI chose to break up with my boyfriend because of some brewing issues with jealousy and because we really had nothing in common and usually sat around and did nothing and said nothing whenever we were together. My friend helped me through everything, supporting me every step of the way, even when the choices weren't to his benefit. All the while, we were learning more and more that we were perfect for each other. Who knew that there was someone out there who liked all the same music, and movies, and foods as I did. Someone who liked to have the same kind of intellectual conversations as me. Someone who'd been looking for the same thing I'd been looking for all along.\n\nI had never looked into someones eyes and seen what I see in his. Now that we've been seeing each other, I'm happier than ever. We couldn't have rushed in any faster but the problem is that we had no choice. I see nothing that I could dislike about him. We drive down the road listening to Queen and making plans to run away to Mexico together. We lay in bed and talk about biology research together and we spontaneously dance under the stars. Talking to him is like talking to myself. Kissing him is like kissing myself.\n\nI keep telling myself that it can't be fate, or love so quickly and so randomly but the more we learn about each other, the more I am sure that there's no way this could've happened on accident. What are the odds that we'd both love grape nuts with bananas or peanut butter and apples or that we'd both be addicted to the same kind of gum. We like to snuggle in the same specific position and we both want to retire and teach high school. We want the same number of kids, the same number of wedding guests, and being with him makes me better than myself. I've never felt so comfortable with someone and neither has he. \n\nI wish I'd known someone who'd experienced what I'm feeling, just so that I could digest what's happening. I just wanted to share :)"

From what I've experienced, it pretty much never works out for anyone else either. Even a co-worker of mine who had the stereotypical \"best friend that she doesn't see that way\" routine and still got the girl, even they broke up after five years and he damn near drank himself to death.\n\nBut they even ended up having problems too! That person you're struggling for, hurting for, going on a quest to impress or whatever might end up not even being enjoyable to date after a while.\n\nMy point is this: don't think that you'll ever be able to figure out who the one is, and don't try and find them. Look around, date around, and let the two of you stumble upon each other. My love and I found each other only when I WASN'T looking to date a girl or have some dirty action.\n\nOh, and communicate, damn it. Don't hold your emotions inside, and DEFINITELY don't be afraid to back out of a relationship that's sinking. Most people stay until the lifeboats are gone and they have to swim back to shore to find a new boat."

I mentioned before the reasons why I fell in love with you, but now that I've thought about it more I'd like to tell you again and more. I could stare into your beautiful eyes and melt. You make my heart race every time I see and think of you. The comfort I feel when I hug you is unlike no other and your kisses wash away all my stress and worry. I feel my heart skip beats when you call and I love hearing your voice. When you tell me good night and that you love me it allows me to dream of you, knowing that one of your last thoughts before sleeping were of me, and waking up to your calls or texts starts my day off amazingly being I was one of the first things on your mind. I love holding your hand, and being told to have nice hands, it brings me laughter. You're a hard worker and that impresses me that you have the dedication that you do, and I hope the stress of your work lessens over time as I can see it taking its toll on your beautiful soul. I miss the way you used to call me sugar or sugar butt as it always made me smile, and how you always ask \"you okay?\" You asking me shows me how much you care and while I may say something like you always ask, I love you asking. You're the woman that I would like to take many adventures and live life to the fullest with. I could not have asked for anyone more perfect for me than you.

I can not change the past but we could build a future.\n\nI'm just looking at myself and I feel disgusted.

Steve then did something amazing to even those of deep faith - as soon as he got the voice that Shavod Jones robbed him of back, he called him in prison. Rather than exoriate Jones for taking just about everything from him, he forgave him and promised he would be there for him once he got out of prison. Sadly, they never met again as Jones was killed in a motorcycle accident 3 days after getting out of jail.\n\nDetective McDonald devoted the rest of his life travelling to schools, prisons, churches, police stations and even war torn countries to spread God's message of forgiveness and peace. He would speak to anyone who would listen. Steven, a devout Catholic, reached millions bringing Christ's message or radical love and forgiveness to the world.\n\nSo of course what was a Gospel for today, the day of Steve's funeral Mass?

I remember in high school I was talking to one of my best friends at the time about my spiritual direction and she was convinced I was being brainwashed or that my sexual orientation was being \"converted\" against my will. Even when I told her the Church doesn't push conversion therapy on people and that I really did want to live the Church's teachings on chastity, she still didn't believe me. The reason I say \"cradle Catholic\" is because people are more likely to believe an adult convert when they say they want to live a Catholic lifestyle. They assume that because cradle Catholics don't have a choice in the faith they were raised, that they don't have a choice in REMAINING in that faith as adults. But on the contrary, I did (and do) have a choice. After beating around the bush about my sexuality through most of my adolescence, I reached a point toward the end of high school where I had to acknowledge it in light of my faith. I could either become a formal heretic and continue to identify as a nominal Catholic despite living a life of unrepentant sin and homosexual activity or I could finally embrace my faith in its fullness. After some initial hesitation and some trial and error, I came to choose the latter. Being raised Catholic didn't rob me of my freedom of choice. Rather, my Catholic upbringing, along with the grace of the sacraments, has helped form me into mature adult who can make these decisions faithfully and by the guidance of the Holy Spirit. And every day I make the same choice to strive for chastity all over again. I've had my share of falls into sexual sin, but like any sin, you have to get back up, go to confession, and keep moving forward on your journey of faith, keeping your focus on God. That is the path to holiness; to keep God in our hearts and never stop trying to improve ourselves for Him. "

We're a group of two guys and four girls, sort of. two of whom you seemed to like. Not me though. When everyone leaves us behind, there's only one word to describe it: awkward. Not just because I like you to much to act normal, but also because you just don't seem to care.\nI've known for a long time now that I should give up on you, but that's hard. It's hard, because I see you everywhere. It's hard because we're friends. It's hard because everyone knows. It's hard because I care too much to let go. In merely two months, I'll leave and I might not come back. We might not ever speak again. I will have to let go, and I'm trying to prepare myself, but I fail every time. \n\nEach time you look at me, a little spark of hope glimmers inside me, and no matter how many buckets of water I throw on the flame, it won't burn out. I hate you so much for being there. I hate you so much for not being there. I hate you so much for liking every other girl more. For kissing her and sleeping with the other. For singing Disney songs, for correcting me, for being a gentleman, for not caring. I hate myself for everything I hate you for.\n\nI think you might have known for a while now. I hope you know. I wish you would just tell me to stop hoping. I wish you would just get a girlfriend. So that  I can cry, eat ice cream and move on. Instead you just said \"okay\" and didn't care. I'm not even sure if you remember, or if you'll pretend to not remember. After all, I did ask you to forget.\n\nIf I would start the conversation, would you talk to me about it or would you run away? Would you be shocked, or pissed off? Do you hate me? Would you feel betrayed that I could possibly think of you as more than a friend? Would you hate me for thinking I had a chance? Am I a terrible person in your eyes, or am I \"okay\"? Would you give me chance? Is it possible? These are the thoughts I so badly want to ignore, but I can't.\n\nI can't pretend I don't feel anything. I can't pretend you aren't there. But I'll try. I write you this letter, so I can end this internal debate. I want to forget about you, I will try to let go. Just don't stop being my friend. Don't stop being awkward.\nAnd when you find a girlfriend, please let it be anyone but her. Let it be someone kind, and someone funny. Someone grounded and someone you're hopelessly in love with. Let it be someone who deserves you. Let it be someone who won't break your heart. Let it be someone who is truly better than me. \n\nHey, I like you. But I think I can stop, if you let me, I'll walk away. I'll let go.\n\nYours,\nyour friend. \n"

            "value": "I went a little late for my morning Mass today so I went again for the evening Mass. I was feeling very hopeless and alone that Jesus is not hearing my prayer and I met my Parish Priest after the Morning Mass and cried to him that I cannot feel that Jesus loves me and that even if I did not receive an answer to my Prayer, I atleast wanted to receive the grace of consolation from Jesus. I told Father I am feeling very abandoned and alone. I was feeling very hurt that I received nothing but silence from Jesus.\n\n\n\n\nI am a Hindu who is practising the Catholic faith from 2004 but my Parents will not allow me to convert and since I have to get married by the arranged marriage route, most guys don't like me practising the Catholic faith so I am still single and alone. I previously made a post regarding this. I can have the life I want if I give my faith but I cannot give up Jesus so that is the main reason I am single..\n\n\n\n\nSo today during evening Mass, in India we usually sit on the floor and there are few pews which mostly the old people and people who find it difficult to sit on the ground use. Today, instead of sitting on the floor where I usually do, I sat next to an Aunty on the pew. Aunty went and received her Communion and came and knelt beside me. When others go to receive Communion, I usually ask Jesus to come into my heart ( Spiritual Communion ) but then since I was feeling so depressed that Jesus was not hearing my prayers, I was doubtful if Jesus will come into my sinful and sorrowful heart. So the Aunty next to me received her Communion and came and knelt next to me, and dusted her handkerchief. Something fell down from it. Since Aunty received her Communion, she did not bother to look at what It might be, and I thought maybe it was some loose change that she had in her hand that fell down. Since I was also kneeling I bent down to help her pick It, and Lo and Behold, it was our dear Loving Jesus Himself in Communion on the ground. I immediately picked Him up from the ground and gave it to Aunty who consumed Him. After Mass, Aunty told me that she already received Communion on the tongue from Father and that the second Host might have accidentally fallen on her handkerchief.\n\n\n\n\nAnd, me, for 14 years I have only seen Jesus at every Mass and have asked Him to come into my heart but today was the first day I physically TOUCHED our dear Jesus. The Priest might have accidentally dropped the second Host, but what are the odds that the person who got the 2nd Host accidentally on her hand kerchief has to the be the person sitting next to me. Me, a worthless sinner, and still a Hindu, since I was crying that I cannot feel His love, from His heavenly throne, He humbly came in the form of a Host and fell on the ground and made me touch Him and pick Him up. O my dear Jesus, how much I doubted your love for me :(\n\n\n\n\nSo I was too upset for the past 2 days to the point of despair that my Prayers were not being heard and Jesus had to do so much to reassure me that He hears my every cry and He loves me :)  :) :) :)\n\n\n\n\nI HAVE TOUCHED OUR DEAR JESUS AND I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE DAY WHEN I WILL RECEIVE HIM IN COMMUNION. Please pray for me to receive Jesus in Communion soon."

Not like the people who only look for their own selfish gain. NO. This life is not just about me. No. Its about being there for the people in my life. Holding them close to my heart. And not letting any of them be hurt by others. I made this mistake in my life, I hurt those who loved me at one point because I how I was living my life. When I realized how wrong I was, I decided to change. To be real. To love. Everyday people go through hurt, deception, depression, and even death. Why not be a rock of support for all those people in your life? To be real. "

At the Sign of Peace, he was very eager to shake hands with the people around him. After the sign of peace, he keeps trying to shake hands. He tugs at his mother\u2019s arm, looks up at her with his huge brown eyes, and says, \u201cI want more peace, mama!\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t we all, little big man. Don\u2019t we all. We need more peace - the peace of Christ - in our lives, in our communities and in our world. \n\nI love sitting behind this family. That little dude is a bit distracting, I\u2019ll admit, but he makes me laugh at least once or twice every time I sit behind him (much to my husband\u2019s dismay - I seriously can\u2019t help it). He adds so much joy to my Mass experience, and he sometimes gives me these great little reminders that Jesus speaks through the people we encounter in our daily lives, even the tiny ones. "

            "value": "Apology in advance, I\u2019m typing on my phone. \n\nOn Christmas Eve, my girlfriend and I attended mass in the morning for the fourth Sunday of Advent. The church we went to was near where she lives but it is not our home parish. The church is a small building, but it is part of one of those multi-church parishes. The parish has 4 church building in it, and 3 priests run the parish, lead by Father Ed. Father Ed is a great priest and, although I do not know him that well, I can tell he truly cares about the church and his mass reflects that. He is one of those super traditional priests (always throws Latin into the mass at every opportunity) and preaches about important values always hitting every nail on the head. \n\nAt the end of the mass, he asked everyone to sit down for announcements. He went on to explain that immediately following this service (9:00am) he was going to one of the other churches to do the 10:30 mass and then inform the congregation there that in 2018 their church would be closing its doors. \n\nHe then went on a small tangent so to speak, and I could tell that this part wasn\u2019t rehearsed or planned for, it felt genuine and from the heart. He asked the church to pray for him, as this is a very difficult thing to do. He also explained how the parish cannot support itself because they don\u2019t have enough money for repairs ( 3 of the church buildings were built before 1920).  He said, \u201c look at us, the building is only half full, we cannot continue like this. Young people aren\u2019t coming to church anymore. This is the way society is and it\u2019s a big problem.\u201d \nAt this point, I looked around to notice my girlfriend and I were the youngest in the church by far (24, and 22). He asked everyone to pray for him and to pray for the church as a whole. \n\nThis really hit home with me. After all, it was Christmas Eve and that is a tough thing to do. \nWe have a problem in the church. It\u2019s a big problem that needs to be addressed, because if not addressed, it\u2019s going to cripple the church for us when we take up the torch. The torch will eventually pass to us and we need to be there to hold it high. This is not negotiable. We are members of Christ\u2019s Church on earth and we must act like it. We need to start getting ourselves out of this churchgoing routine. LIVE THE FAITH. practice what we preach and live actively in the church. Spread the word of god to all that can hear. Spread the teachings of Jesus and of the Catholic Church. Go to confession, get married, become a priest, spread the goodness of the catholic faith. Tradition, humility, and reverence are pillars of our church and they will crumble if we do not hold them up. It makes me sad when I see breathtakingly beautiful churches closed and abandoned. We need to start getting our peers to attend mass for the good of our world. \n\nMy girlfriend\u2019s sister and her fianc\u00e9 attend one of those non denominational Christian churches where a rock band plays songs and then a Joel Osteen person preaches about Jesus for 45 mins. That church is packed to the doors every single weekend and has standing room only. I went to one service and it only made me sad that this is what a catholic mass used to be like, with standing room only. It\u2019s very important that we spread the word of god to all people, stressing not just to believe, but the importance of the catholic faith. \n\nI pray every day for the strength of the church, and I ask you all to join me.\n\nAlso, if you could say a prayer for father Ed, that would be greatly appreciated. The church needs more priests like him. \n\nI hope I haven\u2019t lost all of you with my rant. \n\nEdit: I am not only advocating for a return to more traditional masses, but am arguing for a increased amount of spreading of the word of god and the catholic teachings to non religious as well. Loss of religion in the west is a problem and it is up to us to work harder to bring the word of god to the masses. \n\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m sorry if I am ignorant of how it is in other parts of the country/world as I am from New Jersey, and have always lived here. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like elsewhere so I have nothing to go by. This is all based on my experience so please enlighten me. "

About 6 years ago we decided we were going to break up and the next day the thought of being apart just sucked too much to see it through. Sometimes it was better for us not to focus on why we should stay together, but how much life would suck without the other, and we pushed through it all. Now, with this anniversary coming up, I can honestly say I don't remember the last really bad fight we had - disagreements, sure; miscommunication leading to annoyance and frustration - absolutely. \n\nMarriage, love, relationships - they are like an ocean and we choose our partner to sail across the waters with. Sometimes it gets stormy, the waters are cruel and unforgiving, and it can be really easy to want to bail out and give up keeping that shared boat in tact, but the thing is, no matter how bad the tide may get, every storm comes to an end and if you can weather that storm with your partner, you will be better prepared for the future and tougher for it. \nSo...\n\n\nTL;DR: When you're ready to call it quits, stop thinking about the things you don't like about the relationship, and start focusing on how much life would suck without that person in your life."

You, resting and me, gladly wasting daylight.\n\nYou would sometimes wake up to me kissing your shoulders and back.\nAnd sometimes that\u2019s what it was.\nI whispered thanks to God for making you those other times.\n\n-----\n\nMy parents never approved of my girlfriends.\nThey would always worry about what they wanted in a wife for me.\nIf she didn\u2019t fit the bill they would tell me to break up with her.\nThey would try to convince me that we were actually just friends having a bit of fun.\nAnd when I was alone they\u2019d tell me to marry a creation of their own misguided love.\n\nI remember the night you drove me to my parents when I was sick.\nThey weren\u2019t home, so maybe I should have called first.\nWhen they arrived they asked me how I got there after you left, and where you were after that.\nThe next morning they listened to me make a long list of all of the things you liked.\nOf sweet drinks, and nectarines, and some of my medicine because you were sick too.\nThey were surprised to see me so active and focused despite my fever.\nI considered the supply of the list items, the distances between the stores, and the optimal driving routes to take.\nI asked them to deliver the items to your home.\nThey agreed to my demands, and even packed you some extras.\nI think that\u2019s when they realized that I loved you.\nThey delivered the items and never spoke to me about girlfriends after that.\n\nI still wonder if the nectarines were juicy. They weren\u2019t even in season.\n\n-----\n\nThe nights challenge me the most.\nWriting and prayer keep me busy, but when my better judgement guides me to sleep I still bring enough water for the both of us to the nightstand.\nLast night I woke up at 5:30. I tried, quietly, to creep out to the bathroom so as not to wake you.\nI washed my hands and came back to an empty bed.\nThe blankets you slept under that night were not mine.\nEach bottle of water remained capped and standing.\nI lied awake and quietly missed you.\n\nTwo and a half hours later, I finished breakfast and left for work.\nI gave a presentation that morning.\nI ate lunch, spoke to you, performed my duties, then came home.\nI wrote for a while.\nThen I prayed for a while less this time.\nAnd now my better judgement is guiding me to sleep.\n\n-----\n\nMy love,\n\nThe lamp on my desk is still broken.\n\nI was biking home today trying to swallow all of the tears I had as a result of our chat earlier. It didn\u2019t help that my coworker was leaving. Along the way I opened my mouth for some air and managed to swallow a piece of tree debris because today was very windy and things were being blown in all directions. I thought about how you would have enjoyed how absurd I looked given my situation.\n\nI got home and picked up where I left off: picturing where we\u2019d be a year from now. It\u2019s funny how I\u2019m always looking back into the past when I think about the future.\n\nI\u2019m glad that I\u2019m reminded of the good things we had, and of the moments that we won\u2019t share anymore. My time with you will become a memory and my day will be suddenly become a lot emptier. I have no doubt that, in time, the emptiness will be filled (and with good things, God willing), but you will always occupy a place in my heart. I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this letter to you right now. I guess it\u2019ll be a list of all the things I don\u2019t want to forget. I also secretly hope that you\u2019ll remember these things too, and miss me every once in a while when you think of them.\n\nSome of these things have been brought up before. You know how fondly I think of them. Like how excited I was to leave work every day so that I could come home to you. You\u2019d be in bed, napping quietly. I would try to sneak in, but the zippers on my favorite jacket were so loud that you would wake up, but sleepily lift up the sheets to welcome me inside anyway..\n\nWe\u2019d go shopping sometimes. Now that I think of it, most of our grocery shopping was done together. We\u2019d pick things out and you\u2019d always grab something, decide against it a few minutes later, then leave it somewhere else. It must have given the supermarket employees a story or two to find noodles in the dairy aisle every week.\n\nWe\u2019d also cook for each other sometimes. I don\u2019t know why I wasn\u2019t a fan of butter before. I know I\u2019ve had it, but it didn\u2019t taste good until I tried the zucchini you made for me (or was it cucumber? Ha ha). I also couldn\u2019t believe that you weren\u2019t a fan of spicy foods, but I was glad to hear that you were coming around. \u201cI\u2019ll have to like it if I live with you.\u201d\n\nOne of my regrets is that I never took good care of my skin. It\u2019s obviously important, but those hot showers and my overall lack of motivation slowly diminished the moisture in me until you came along. I don\u2019t know why I was made without the ability to reach that one spot on my back, but I was so glad that you came along to rub lotion on the places that needed you the most.\n\nI\u2019m also glad that I had you to call when I had bad dreams. You told me that I could call you at any time and you\u2019d come running. I pictured you as Ponyo, hurtling through the air on your magical fish, coming to comfort me as fast as the world would let you. Because Ponyo loves Sosuke and Sosuke loves all the Ponyos. It\u2019s a big responsibility, but he really loves her.\n\nAnd finally (for now), I\u2019m glad that we fought about the ideologies that we have strong feelings about. We were hurt and upset and I loved you with all of my heart and I know you loved me too. We learned that we shouldn\u2019t worry about ideologies. We just had to worry about love. You\u2019ll never have to wonder if I loved you when we fought. I always have and I always will.\n\nYou just sent me a text message, telling me that you\u2019re cancelling on a show we were going to see with our friends, and that you needed some alone time. You told me that you might go out later, and that you\u2019ll call me if you do.\n\nI would give so much to see you right now."

You created all of the amazing feelings. Feelings I can only imagine. I imagine the feeling God felt when he created the universe. He had looked back at it and basked in all its beauty and grace. There may have been flaws but he let them flow to create perfection. Because he saw no flaws. But the only thing with me is I actually felt those feelings.  I got to feel that with you because you were and really are still my universe. Your amazing dark hair with all of its poof reminds me of the night sky when I would drive in Mexico and see the whole universe,with all of its stars and planets, looking back at me. Your beautiful gorgeous brown eyes remind me of galaxies that are so far from us and so faint ,yet all we see is the beauty of the stars around them that illuminate their celestial bodies, the way your eyes illuminate your whole face when I look into them. Your teeth so cute and perfect when you smile even though you hate how some may be crooked to you. All i see is a beautiful ray of sunshine when you smile. I see the frustration and anger I created and I weep. You were creation and I was this evil destruction. You created all this amazement and wonder, while I just tore it all down. I created the bad while you worked so hard to create the good. I am nothing now, for I did it to myself. I am nothing more than a simple man at this point while you are a beautiful walking aura of all good things in this universe. You are a goddess. A beautiful celestial body. This all may be clich\u00e9 to others but I cannot describe the beauty in words of a universe the same I cannot with yours. You are an amazing mother Zeus is blessed to have. Ha Zeus has a god name while you are an actual goddess walking this earth. Its fitting for him. For if not you being in my life and giving my life meaning and direction I wouldn't even be able to give myself the title of a simple man. I do love you with all my heart, soul, and my being. I want my future back. But alas one cannot simply get a universe back when he has burned it. But I plan to try and heal it. To mend it and make our bond stronger. Even if our love doesn't burn as brightly as it first did, Id rather it burn stronger and longer.  "

It's snorting while laughing, it's the tears when it feels like it's all crashing down, it's the farting, it's the bed head and bad breath, it's the random dances, it's the anger and the joy. Love is an amazing thing. It's knowing that someone loves you so much and won't leave you even though you said something mean and hurtful. It's those nights you fall asleep in each others arms feeling like there will never be enough time with them. It's cleaning up their throw up or just rubbing their back when they're sick. It's the hardest, most rewarding thing in the world. Because at the end of the day you get to crawl into bed with your best friend; the weirdest, most annoying, loving, goofy, perfect person that you know.

I'm solid on the reasoning, but so much on the expression, so I'm interested in any feedback. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/RadBigHistory/wiki/emotion/emotion#wiki_metaphysics_of_emotions\n\nMetaphysics of Emotions\n\nWHAT ARE SENSES?\n\nYou use your senses to gather information about the outside world. You can see, hear, taste, smell and touch things. You can also detect pain, pressure, temperature, and the position and movement of your body. All these sensations are changed into electrical signals and carried to your brain which then puts all the information together to produce the whole picture.\n\nSensation: a physical feeling resulting from thoughts, perceptions, what happens within, or comes into contact with the body.\n\nFEELINGS V EMOTIONS\n\nAlthough the two words are used interchangeably, there are distinct differences between feelings and emotions. ... Feelings and emotions are two sides of the same coin and highly interconnected, but are two very different things.\n\n'Feeling' in this context is equivalent to the above definition of Sensation.\n\nFeeling: a physical sensation resulting from thoughts, perceptions, what happens within, or comes into contact with the body.\n\nEMOTION = THOUGHT + FEELING\n\nAn emotion, in the sense of what goes on in the mind, is always comprised of two components: thoughts and feelings. The important contrast here is that a feeling is something felt in the body, while a thought happens purely in the mind.\n\nEmotion = Thought (Psychology/Semantics) + Feeling (Physiology/Phenomenology)\n\nA contrast can be seen between Semantics which is a branch of logic concerned with meaning is derived, and how thoughts are arranged, and Phenomenology that studies how meaning is derived through consciousness and the felt experience.\n\nAn emotion always has a semantic aspect of thoughts/ideas also relating to Psychology which is the science of mind, and a phenomenological aspect of sensations in the body, relating to Physiology which is a sub-discipline of Biology.\n\nThoughts occur through experience. That can be experience in interactions with the external world and also through contemplation.\n\nIS HUNGER AN EMOTION?\n\nIn this case it is, except the 'thoughts' component of hunger that creates the feeling is coming from the body itself and not the mind. When you feel hunger, the 'thought' is coming from your body, not your mind.\n\nWhen you are feeling hungry, the 'thought' seems to come from your stomach.\n\nIn contrast, when you feel the emotion of longing associated with Love, the 'thought' is coming from your mind.\n\nLook at those two examples in the light of our definition of Feeling/Sensation\n\nFeeling: a physical sensation resulting from thoughts (Love), perceptions, what happens within (Hunger), or comes into contact with the body.\n\nEMOTION = LOGIC + FEELING\n\nInstead of saying: Emotions = Thoughts + Feelings, we can use the term \"Logic\" to describe all cases of feeling/sensation.\n\nSwap words with the above sentence to \"When you feel hunger, the 'logic' is coming from your body, not your mind.\"\n\nWe can say in the case of Love, logic comes from the mind, while in the case of Hunger, logic comes from the body.\n\nCOMPASSION and LOVE\n\nWe can say in the case of Love, logic comes from the mind.\n\nSo where does the feeling of Love come from?\n\nIn the case of hunger there is no outside party. In the case of love there is always an other.\n\nWe have thoughts of the other, but where does the feeling come from?\n\nThat feeling happens in the body. In other words, the felt experience is through body physiology.\n\nCompassion is the physiological root of love. Compassion in a deep sense is the physiological component that handles the bodily sensations associated with Love.\n\nLove, along with other pro-social emotions such as empathy, mercy and solidarity connote behaviors and relationships that are 'conditional' on experience, while Compassion is denoted as a 'constant' functions as a physiological root and connection to our psychological needs.\n\nLove takes two forms of logic. One is compassion that is logic of the body, the other is a set of thoughts that are accumulated through experience. Compassion is biology, Love is psychology.\n\nWHAT IS COMPASSIONATE REASONING?\n\nCompassionate reasoning works to reconcile the one component of compassion that is logic in the body with the other component that is logic in the mind.\n\nCompassionate reasoning works to reconcile the logic of the body with logic in the mind that is conditional on belief, which is itself dependent on learning through experience.\n\nIn an individual sense, compassionate reasoning is being fair in interpersonal relations.\n\nCompassionate reasoning has an attitude, outlook, mindset and agenda.\n\nCompassionate reasoning in personal relations seeks to provide shared experience that fosters mutual appreciation.\n\nIn a more universal sense, compassionate reasoning seeks to inform through words and behavior a shared understanding of the function of compassion to the world, and therefore the self in the world."

My lost Love was a girl I knew back when I was age 17-19. We use to spend a lot of time together traveling about and entertaining each other with conversation. Yet in those days we were only friends because I had a girlfriend and so did she. Thus we didn't do anything past a friend level despite our strong feelings for one another.\n\nThen things happen in life, we lost contact. To never be heard from again. Yet they say never say never. \n\nThen this brings us to now. Where I have been single for a great many months and only wished I had a reason to post in this sub. \n\nNot very long ago, I was only walking into a bar to meet a pal before we were to travel to a party. When a women calls to me by name. I shutter with fear in the thought that it were to be a non-friend of mine.\n\nAs she started towards me, I am forced to look upon her. Then I see a face that was gone from my mind. As I recall her memory, all that was, reminds me of who she is. \n\nHere standing before me is the girl that in bodies me in likeness of understanding in this universe. A quality extremely rare, do to my enlightenment. Yet there she stood.\n\nNow it has been revealed to me that she has always thought of me in a similar way as I her.\n\nConsidering the mind set that is we, I am filled with love for this women I had all but forgotten. \n\nWho is to say where this will go, but I feel like starting off from a state of love has a great deal of potential.\n\nI am happy to be filled with the feelings of love again and wanted to share it with you.\n\nThank you for reading."

Our marriage has been hard; it's very difficult for her to pay attention to or care for me, our son, or our house with her own mental wounds.\n\nThings came to a head very recently when she \"fell in love\" with someone she met online, in a video game. He's out of the picture now (this all literally happened in less than a month), but she's wrestling with her own lack of identity, and hating herself. She's decided that what she wants to do to \"find herself\" is divorce, be by herself for some indeterminate amount of time, and then... who knows?\n\nWe were married in the Church. She's a confirmed (convert) Catholic, but has never been able to, for example, go to Mass consistently.\n\nI asked her to wait before making a decision on this, just a little bit. She's going on a week-long trip in January to see some friends, so I asked her to take that time and space. She said she would, but has since also decided that we are, in fact, separated. She was confused by my grief by that decision. It's so stupid, isn't it? Facebook is nothing, it's utterly meaningless, but one of the hardest times I've broken down over this was when I saw her status go from Married to Separated, she changed her profile picture to one of just herself, and changed her last name.\n\nI've been telling her, and I mean it, that no matter what she does, I love her and will always love her. That I don't want this to happen, but I will help her whatever she does. That no matter what *she* does, I know that we're still married. I feel like I shouldn't do anything to help with procuring a civil divorce, or that I should let her stay in the house as long as possible (she's my wife, after all). But this is tearing my heart apart. I can't stand being in the same house without being able to treat her like my wife, without touching her. She says (and I believe her) that she loves me, and hopes that she'll be able to come back to our marriage and get remarried (!), but she also is calling and describing me as a friend now. It hurts so much to be ripped away from someone that was my flesh, that I joined my soul to, and be assured that I'm now their \"best friend.\" I think that hurts more than if she angrily rejected me. I don't want her to be miserable, but it breaks my heart how nonchalantly and quickly she did this, and how much better she seemed to feel once she did it.\n\nI'm scheduling an appointment with a priest (that'll probably take a month to set up, but whatever) for some spiritual direction. Like I said above, I don't really have any Catholic friends that can understand where I'm coming from. My family has been absolutely amazing and supportive of me, but they don't really understand that I'm married for good or for ill, and nothing she does can change that.\n\nThe thought of a lifetime of celibacy being my call scares me sometimes. The lifetime of loneliness seems overwhelming at times. The only Catholics in my family are my parents, and my dad immediately brought up the possibility of an annulment. Sometimes, that seems very attractive, but I don't think the odds of our marriage being nulled on account of immaturity or mental incapacity are very good. Also, I want to stay married with this woman who I love! But I'm also torn, because the marriage has been incredibly difficult, and she has been emotionally abusive and manipulative much of the time, and the thought that I could go on from this with all I've learned and grown and find a healthy relationship with a strong, capable, loving woman who could support me as a wife and our son as a mother... yes, God help me yes, that is so tempting at times that it hurts.\n\nThis is long. I'm sorry. I don't even know what I expect to get. Please pray for me, that God gives me the wisdom to know His will for me, and the grace to accomplish His will, and that no matter happens, that I grow in holiness and love of Christ. God bless you.\n\n**EDIT** Thank you so much to everyone who has commented. You've been a tremendous blessing to me. Thank you."

Well because my staring, she was starting to see me as a creep or something. And you can probably imagine how it feels when someone who you have feelings for starts thinking about you like that. Yeah, a heart crushing feeling.\n\n Few days left in the camp and i was trying to tell her how i felt so she could maybe change her mind about me, but she was always with her friends. And when she was alone, i just couldn't do it. Even on the last day when our parents were coming to pick us up. I had so many chances but i just couln't open my mouth and tell her how i felt. When her parents came and i knew it was too late, i just wanted to cry like 5 hours straight and smash my fu##ing head to the wall. \n\nJust don't f#ck up like i did. Even if you're shy, tell her/him because i didn't and i know i will regret it for the rest of my life. Im just a 15 stupid kid that couldn't tell her."

No matter how long it takes, true love is worth the wait these words are simple to put in a sentence but very difficult to apply in real life. Waiting for the one who you love more than you love yourself is never easy. Knowing the fact that the person you are waiting for isn\u2019t aware that you are waiting can be the worst thing one could expect from a relationship. So stop waiting for the one who isn\u2019t aware that you are waiting. Instead wait for the one who would do anything to be your everything."

            "value": "Lately I found out why my parish church, despite being the most horrible example of boomer architecture in all of Brussels, was chosen by Cardinal Robert Sarah for his \"God or Nothing\" talk today. It turns out that not a single member of the clergy in Brussels, not even the Bishop, wants to have him in their parishes. Some, because they reject Sarah's stance on abortion, euthanasia, \"gay marriage\", \"gender theory\", and other modern sins that Belgian culture endorses (and that the Belgian Church at least tolerates). Others, because Sarah has become such a polemical figure that they don't want to bring any problems into their churches. I mean, even the RadTrad monks over at Sainte Catherine church, a church that is in *much* need of a spiritual boost (and a physical one, it's under constant threat of being closed and desecrated!) don't want anything to do with his visit!\n\nSo, after contacting nearly every single church in Culture of Death City, it turns out that the only church whose priest was brave enough to host the talk was Our Lady of Stockel, coincidentially my parish church. It seems most Belgians are quite angry with the fact that Sarah even got a place to have his talk. Even the priest that is responsible for our pastoral unit [declared to a famous newspaper](http://www.lalibre.be/regions/bruxelles/une-visite-de-cardinal-qui-interpelle-a-stockel-5a738937cd70fdabb9c1de14) that he dissented with Sarah's \"God or Nothing\" message, deeming it too intolerant, and even \"on the Antipodes of the Gospel\". He went as far as to declare that \"this kind of statements **could have serious consequences** on a pastoral level, in a world where one should keep in mind the absence (or rejection) of God among a large number of our contemporaries\". Of course, the Belgian media already hates Cardinal Sarah for being \"too traditionalist\".\n\nI also wouldn't rule out that some protest group might do a stunt during the talk, or even during the mass that precedes it. I still have in mind the FEMEN stunt where Archbishop L\u00e9onard was soaked in (let us suppose) holy water that these naked women threw at him from *Our Lady of Banneux* bottles. I'm seriously scared that a group of feminists, LGBTQ activists, anarchists, or militant communists might enter the Church building during communion, and profanate the temple and the Hosts. I'm even **more** scared that a Taliban group, or some ISIS lone wolf, might target the church for a massacre, or at least to behead the celebrating cardinals and priests, [as they did in Normandy not so long ago](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3708394/Two-men-armed-knives-people-hostage-French-church.html)...\n\nI don't want to think about all of this, but I'm genuinely terrified. I mean, of course I believe in a Church where martyrdom makes you an instant saint, and where God Himself let men kill Him so that He could forgive them for all of their sins. But... It seems just too early for me... I'm just a 21 year old young adult, not even mature enough to leave my parents' home. I had so many hopes for the future, for evangelizing through my work!\n\nPlease pray for all of us, and for Cardinals Robert Sarah and Joseph DeKesel. Both deserve the prayers, but I think now DeKesel deserves them the most.\n\n*Kyrie eleison. Christe eleison. Kyrie eleison.*\n\nMost Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, pray for us. Saint Michael the Archangel, pray for us. Saint Gudula, pray for us. Blessed Maria Dolorosa of Bravant, pray for us.\n\n**EDIT: Sarah was all right, and nothing bad happened!** And we didn't even have proper security guards! We only had a small issue with a mad hobo (whom we all know). He stepped into the church's entrance near the end of the talk, and he got quickly carried out by our volunteering staff. I will share the important stuff with you all later!"

It will be too late then to choose your side. There is no use saying you choose to lie down when it has become impossible to stand up.

Basically, I got to know this great girl (who I'll Pat) online and we clicked instantly. We like each other and would love to go out together but we can't, because Pat's afraid she'd get attached and she doesn't want that since she's leaving the country for a year on an internship next June. \n\nTwo days ago however, Pat messaged me and we got talking. She told me that she would like to see me at least once before she leaves, and I said I want to as well. Pat also said that she had gone on a 2nd date with another guy but she doesn't feel like they clicked in that special way like me and her did. I told Pat I feel the same, that I'm talking to another girl but it's just not the same as talking to her.\n\nSo I inadvertently find myself making plans to meet up. I got some snacks and a bottle of ros\u00e9 wine and picked Pat up at midnight that same night, after she finished from work, incidentally just as I turned 22. We went to a quiet place by the sea and just talked and laughed. We were both a bit shy but I think it went well considering I never do this kind of thing and it was the first time I'd ever seen Pat in real life. I took her home, we hugged and she said that she hopes to meet up again. Despite the willingness she showed to stay in contact and meet up again, Pat hasn't really made much effort to communicate since that night. It seems like she's still a bit confused. So am I, to be quite honest.\n\nIt's funny and a bit sad that without the internship business, things would be so different. I don't consider this a success story, because we still can't be together. Not until she comes back from abroad in a year, and a whole lot can change in a year. But I'm just satisfied that we met up, and it's comforting to think that I mean something to her too. \n\nThere's no real point to this post, just a reminder that life works in crazy ways sometimes, a small story to share with you lovely redditors, and a way for it to help register in my mind that this actually happened; it's still all a blur in my head."

A congregant at our church mentioned to be that the catholics are Mary worshippers and that they could never get behind the idea of infant baptism and that praying to the saints in unbiblical. I just found it funny (again) that i'm spending more time defending inherently original catholic ideas than spreading Protestant ones (you're welcome). \n\nAnyways, I just wanted to let you all know that I think you guys are the bomb.

I got in line as normal and ended up in front of my pastor who I've received Communion from countless times; he is also the priest who brought me into the Church when I converted. I genuflected then stood and opened my mouth to receive when he asked me for my hands. I was confused since I've received on the tongue from him before, so I said I wasn't comfortable receiving on my hands (which I'm not). He told me to talk to him after mass and gave me Communion as normal. \n\nAfter mass he stops me at the entrance of the Church (surrounded by people) and asks why I wouldn't receive on my hand. I said again, \"I'm not comfortable with it, and I thought the USCCB said it was our choice.\" He then launches into me saying it was prideful of me to not receive on the hand, that I was \"disrupting parish unity\" by not doing so and that I was \"ignorant about the teaching.\" Again, this is all very public. I said again that I was confused, that I thought I had a right to receive on the tongue, and I would prefer to do so since it is the way the rest of my family receives. He responded by saying, \"then you need to go to a different parish.\" I said, \"Father, this is my geographical parish and the one I was received into the Church in, you were the one who brought me into the Church, I don't understand this.\" To which he responded, \"I'm the pastor and I want this uniformity. If you don't like it go somewhere else.\" I told him, \"I'm not okay with this. It's like your excommunicating me from my home, and I don't think the bishop would be okay with this either.\" He started walking away and said \"Go ahead and tell him, he'll just laugh at you.\" \n\nI don't understand this. I've received Communion there on the tongue before, even from *him*! I've known him 12 years, 9 of which I've been Catholic and I've never seen him like this. The man I was talking to seemed so unlike how he's always been. I didn't do anything ostentatious, or anything I haven't done before but I ended up having the pastor (again, very publicly) telling me I wasn't welcome there unless I stop receiving Communion on the tongue. \n\nI just can't wrap my head around it. The man who brought me into the Church said I can't go to my home parish unless I receive Communion in a way that is deeply uncomfortable for me and against the tradition of my Catholic family members. I drove home angry but when I got there I couldn't help but cry. \n\nWas I wrong about this r/Catholicism? It took me but two minutes to find a USCCB document saying it was my choice how to receive, but has that been superseded? I really don't know how to respond to this. "

Some people even go as far as to say that because I make room for everyone in my heart, that I undermine individual friendship. That is not my intention what-so-ever, and I apologize if anyone feels like they were put on the back-burner. Before you think I'm creepy (which I'm sure a lot of people do, but I really don't give a rat's behind.) Let me tell you why I do this.\n\nI make it a point to start my day off by telling folks \"I love you.\" and \"You are worthy.\" I do this not only to give back to the people that loved me when I was at my absolute worst, but also because the world needs a giant dose of love and laughter. We don't get nearly enough in this day and age, and that, my friends, is the problem.\n\nWe all claim to want love and peace, and we are SUFFERING because we are not giving it to other people. How are you going to receive if you do not give? Everything in this world is a reflection of your actions, consequences, and your surroundings. The world owes you nothing except a chance at life and the inevitable promise of death. What you do in the meantime is all on you.\n\nI see kids and grown men on the streets selling drugs and being beaten to be in a gang for Christ's-sake. All because we need to fulfill a torn ego with a hole in it, that will never be patched up or repaired because we can't take the time to examine our true selves. We keep feeding ego, and the results are thrown right back at us. We die hungry for fulfillment, but we never find it in the right ways.\n\n\"Why in the world do people need to put themselves in harm's way just to prove themselves?\"\n\nI can answer that question for you. If you take a criminal, a kid from the \"hood\" who gets into trouble, a nerdy rich kid who's teetering on the edge of suicide, and even yourself, and ask them why they do whatever it is they feel the need to do, they'll basically tell you the same thing even though they have different backgrounds.\n\nThey want to feel loved, brave, accepted, and worthy. Twisted right? Spreading hate will get you hate in return. Spreading love will give you love. It simple, and not meant to utilized in the opposite form.\n\nI am the twenty year old female that saw what other kids went through in foster homes. I am the child who would've stopped at nothing to end their own life. I am the still the ten year old that longs for a bond between a mother and daughter. I am the kid who started school in special ed that other kids made fun of. I am the girl who wishes to be skinny. I am the grown woman in a one bedroom apartment, in a neighborhood where folks live off $600.00 a month and scrape by. I AM THE WOMAN WITH A DREAM OF PEACE. You can forever ask me how I can relate to others so well. You can criticize me for loving everyone despite their differences. You can ask me why I love the most horrible people. And you can call me fake. But my answer will never change. I will tell you,\n\n\"I know because I lived it.\""

I write because I love her so much that it drives me insane and I have no other emotional outlet.\n\nI long to be with her. Just being near her makes my heart do backflips. It makes me feel....so alive. More alive than I could ever imagine. We could be just sitting in an empty closet together and we wouldn't have to do or say a single thing. And I would just melt in every second of perfect bliss. Simply because she's just in the room.\n\nI long to hold her in my arms and feel her body so close to mine. Her heart beating against my chest while I fight the urge to never let her go. Her beautiful eyes gazing into mine as I kiss her gently. In my mind that would make me the luckiest man to ever live.\n\nI dream of the day where I can hold her in my arms and call her mine. And be there for her. All the time. Not because I have to, but because it's all I ever want to do.  \n\nBut I'm an idiot. I can't spend time with her without later regretting doing or not doing certain things. I can never seem to give her the most amazing time that I know I'm capable of giving her. I cannot just open up and be myself. My love for her gets in the way of my ability to show her how great we would be together. And that tears me apart. It rips me to shreds. It eats away at my mind day and night. And that just makes me love her even more. It's torturous that I cannot be with the love of my life.\n\nShe is my weakness. She confuses me and then I confuse myself even more by thinking about it too much. I hate not knowing how she feels about me.\n\nBut most importantly, I wish she could read this. I wish I could just tell her how I really feel and not have to worry about creeping her out or overwhelming her. I wish she could just read every last word and know that they're REAL. That they are as real as she makes me feel alive. That there is somebody out there who wants to be with her more than anything. Ever.\n\nMan, I've got to stop. This is crazy."

She had long light brown hair with curls in them, she had an athletic figure and was about my age (22). I felt an instant connection, like I have never felt before. The entire dream was just perfect. I remember it felt like having a tornado of butterflies in my stomach, our bond was instantaneously strong, like ive known her my entire life. During this dream we had an incredible time. We were fighting off villains on top of crystal castles, sitting around a camp fire with my best friends. She saved my life a couple of times and vice versa =).\n\nI felt complete and I knew she felt the same way. We hardly exchanged words and when she touched my hand with hers it was like thousands of little needles softly poking my skin.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am under no illusion that this was all in my mind. I realize that this girl most likely does not even exist and even if she did, who is to say I would ever meet her, let alone talk to her, let alone have the same feelings for her... \n\nRight after we kissed for the first time the dream began to fade and I woke up. I began to realize that I had just been dreaming, yet the pain I now felt was shockingly real. I immediately had this feeling of dreadful loneliness and despair. Reluctantly I have to admint that I shed a tear or two, fully knowing that I probably will never experience such bliss in real life.\n\nNow, seven hours later my memories are already beginning to fade. I can only find a bit of solace in the idea of somehow meeting this girl again while im asleep. Thinking of which, I cant wait for night to come, for there is a chance I might see her again.

It was so easy to go to you with my problems because you were so supportive, but ultimately I forgot how to stand on my two feet. You're right in that there probably were a million reasons why we fell apart, but my lack of ability to love myself and my lack of independence could certainly be seen as a root of many of those problems. I'm so sorry you had to shoulder so much-my pain on top of yours-during the time we were together, and I'm sorry for my part in everything. I don't resent you at all (I'm sorry that I ever said I could), and I'm learning to forgive myself too.\n\nI'm learning from this, and taking care of myself now. I feel healthier than I have in a while, because for the first time, I'm making an effort to be strong and love myself. You said you didn't want to go back and this was probably best for the long term. I don't want to go back either, because that relationship wasn't the best for the both of us, but I hope we can move forward together someday. This time apart may be helpful for both of us to become stronger, a little wiser  and healthier, and maybe one day soon, we can make each other happy again. Maybe this time apart will be something we can look back on as an event that was, indeed, better for our longterm relationship. I hope so. \n\nUntil then, I'll be growing, learning, and remembering you for everything you have given me. Thank you for everything and for being all that you are. I love you always. \n"

I'm very proud of the people who contacted the mods about this and responded to the post in compassion in charity, even if it was just to let OP know that people were praying for them. Fortunately, OP did resurface on Monday safe and sound.\n\nI just want to post these tips not as much as a moderator but more as someone who's been on both sides of these situations.\n\n1) Contact the mods immediately. Message us to make sure at least one of us knows what's going on. And while I normally hate being PMed for mod business, you can PM me for this. If I'm on mobile, I can't get modmail (I can't speak for the other mods). This will increase the chances that someone sees the post. We can then work with the admins to try to get the person help if possible.\n\n2) Upvote for visibility. A suicide note is more a cry for help than a farewell to the world when made in a public forum like this or when it is left somewhere where it can easily be found. Raise the alarm, make it visible to the rest of the community.\n\n3) Report any and all trolling. Trolls will be banned and reported to the admins for further discipline.\n\n4) Make sure someone in the thread posts the appropriate suicide hotline. In the US it's **1-800-273-8255**. Make it big, make it bold, make it easy to see. And it's fine if that number gets posted more than once.\n\n5) Say something. If you've been in their situation, it's important for them to know that they can get through it just as you have. If you haven't, offering to pray or saying a kind word really can do a lot to steady a person's resolve. If you don't know what to say, just let OP know you're praying for them. **Do not try to fix their problem.** It probably won't be listened to in the moment anyway. The most important thing is to listen and to encourage them to get help. Problem solving can come later.\n\n6) Don't be overly optimistic. It will come across at best as insincere and at worse as a patronizing. Recognize where this person is and meet them there. Acknowledge their suffering. Their problems may be a trifle to you, but something has happened that makes OP deem them to be world-ending issues. Be sensitive to that. Even if you can't directly relate to what OP is going through, they can find comfort in knowing that someone is listening to them and taking them seriously.\n\n7) Someone might want to use the faith as leverage in the situation. While the theological argument against suicide is absolutely correct, in the context of mental illness a suicidal person will probably not listen to it. When a depressed or anxious person gets to the point where suicide looks like a good idea, hell isn't necessarily that scary. To this person their suffering is at the point where hell just looks like an even trade; it's not worse than what they're experiencing now, and some may believe they really deserve to be in hell. So while I won't say don't bring hellfire up, it probably won't be effective on its own in the aforementioned situation. You might want to couple it with some other appeals, especially if no one else has responded to the post yet.\n\n8) I know this one is hard, but refrain from offering to talk to OP privately, whether by phone or email or pm. This is not because I think anyone here would be malicious, but working with a suicidal person is a very emotionally intense and draining experience. It's also very easy to inadvertantly make a misstep. It's not a good idea to risk getting in over your head. Encourage OP to respond in thread so others can help out. Remember, if OP is responding at all, that's a good thing. If one of you is a member of the clergy, a trained therapist/psychologist/psychiatrist, this does not apply. \n\nFinally, I'd like to introduce you guys to /r/SuicideWatch. They have a lot of great resources that can be helpful in a situation like this. You can find them here: https://np.reddit.com/r/SWResources/\n\nHopefully we won't need this in the future, but better safe than sorry. Thank you for your time.\n\nPS - I'll see if we can add this to the wiki for quick reference in the future."

I converted in Turkey (I am a Turk) and attend church here. After three months of converting I came out of the closet to my mom and sister.  My mom is the most pro-christian muslim one can ever witness so she was happy that I started to believe in God again. My sis was an agnostic and she was happy for me even though she was kind of militant on her (lack of) belief. Anyways after 1 year of my conversion, my sister converted to Catholicism also. She is currently at RCIA.(like me) Anyways she decided to stay in closet (because she was 14 at the time). \n\n2 weeks ago my sister came up to my mom but this time she was very surprised considering both of her children decided to be Christians. So she told me to tell a bit about our religion.\n\nI first talked about the uninformed ideas about Christianity almost all Muslims have in Turkey (and on other parts of the planet) because by destroying those weak arguments creates a way better evangelization tool as people are more eager to listen what you say when they found out many things about Christanity that they were told were lies. \n\nThen I mentioned how coming of the Messiah was really unneeded in islam and how Old Testament prophesied that coming messiah in very specific cases. (Isaiah 53, 9:6 comes to mind) I also mentioned how good Bible was preserved and how corruption of the Bible claim rooted to 12th century and how people like Imam Gazali thought Bible was perfectly preserved. \n\nThis made her intrigued and she decided to read the New Testament for herself. She said she loved it so much and Jesus was a great person. Though she said that she found the nature of Christ very confusing which is understandable for a first time Bible reader. I addressed her issues with some verses but it was the Alpha and the Omega verse that did it for her. (And Ignatius of Antioch)\n\nAnyways later on she asked whether she could come to church with us this Sunday and we said of course. (Especially as there was a celebration kind of event with youth groups and communities.)\n\nShe was very respectful, and she said she really felt the joy in the eyes of the worshippers. \n\nAnd the minute I turned my eye I saw her talking with a Friar (Franciscan) and laughing. People really welcomed her and I love them even more due to that and I saw how she really liked the Community (we are basically a family at this point) and she never felt this way with her fellow muslims. (My mom is a secular Muslim whereas most practicant Muslims are conservative and conservatism in Turkey is in a very dangerous level.).\n\nAfter that we attended Mass and since the Bishop was at mass it was a very High Church event which is one of the weak points of my mom. (And mine...and my sister's). I could see how much she liked it. (It was impossible not to like it, and church was so packed that some people needed to stand up). After communion she even standed up for a blessing from the priest (not receiving communion of course).\n\nLater I asked her whether she liked it or not, she said she could see the love in everyone's eyes and then she said \"Bible says God is love afterall\". I can't believe these are really happening but the Holy Spirit is working afterall :)\n\nPlease pray for her to convert. God I am so happy. You can also ask any questions you like, I am in a really good mood :)\nAnyways sorry this turned out that long.\nGod bless each one of you."

Then this song came on and I had the most amazing dream I've had in a long time. I guess this girl who's a really good friend of mine and that I really like were staying in a big house with her family for the week end or something cause it started with me coming from outside, looking her in the eyes, putting my had out and saying come on, I want to show you something. And this wasn't a house in the city either, but also not in the woods. It was just.... There. Anyways she looks back at me in a kinda surprised look but takes me hand and I tell her to close her eyes. Then I lead her outside to a bridge with a calm river going under it and tell her to open them. She does and she's taken back in awe at the night sky. It was just beautiful and we both love astrology which made it even better. We were standing there looking into the sky and then we both looked at each other with out words and kissed.\nThe song was lullaby (produced by Tedder, prickett & kutzle) by onerepublic. Sorry I couldn't find a good YouTube video of it.\n\nAlso if someone wants to make a picture of it I would really appreciate it and I listed more details bellow.\nDetails:\nBridge was a round, hump type bridge.\nThe water below had a violet reflection but there wasn't really a direction it was coming from, just that it had a violet reflection on it.\nA lot of the stuff on the ground(plants, some dirt, ect) was glowing kinda like the movie avatar.\nIdk how else to explain the sky other than is was just a beautiful night sky that I've only seen in pictures since I live near a big city, I'll include a picture of the closest it looked like.\nSky: http://www.dailygalaxy.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/07/11/milky_way.gif\nCould you make the picture with us either standing next to each other staring at the sky in amazement or us kissing, your pick.\n\nFor those of you wondering, I do plan on telling her I like her sometime soon."

One of the things that made this sub stand out to me (besides Jesus) among the thousands of other subs on this website was the graciousness and respect that seems so lacking in 'civil' discussion today. Usually someone would post something, another would potentially disagree, and both sides would have a civil discussion. Both remained mature and neither lost their heads.\n\nNow it seems that the discussion goes something like this:\n\n- OP about the Pope, chastity, Trump, etc.\n- Person A: \"comment about OP\"\n- Person B: \"disagreement with above comment\"\n- Person A: \"passive aggressive response\"\n- Person B: \"personal attack on character\"\n- Person A: [removed]\n- Person B: [removed]\n- Person A: [removed]\n- Person B: [removed]\n- Person C: \"response that no one can understand because the entire conversation has been removed\"\n\nI miss the sub where posters would assume the best of each other and not succumb to petty grievances. It's gotten to the point where some people argue with other commenters so much that they know each other by name. I've even seen people reject advice solely because it came from a poster they recognized that they didn't like. \n\nI fear that many of us have become so jaded, bitter, and fearful about the world that we have lost sight of God's love. We have spent so much time defending our beliefs that we have lost sight of His mercy. We will never agree on absolutely everything, but we can ALL agree that we are instructed by our Lord Savior to treat one another with dignity and respect. This is one thing that should be enough for all of us. Love y'all, and God bless."

Truth be told, I don\u2019t understand my entire thought process but its something I ranted about wanting before. Thats is to be irrational. \n\nI know we barely know each other and that you have a boyfriend but I can\u2019t get you off my mind. I\u2019ll be honest with my feelings and admit that I\u2019ve never wanted anyone as much as I want you. The means of which would be irrelevant as long as you\u2019re there in the end. The means being a friend or me being your boyfriend I don\u2019t care, I just want you. \n\nThe times we talk, if you only knew how hard it is to breath or form words towards coherency. I can\u2019t even look you straight in the face without the feeling of a thousand suns radiating and the feeling that I\u2019ve gotten 2 or 3 skin pigments darker. \n\nIts funny, I have the reputation of knowing exactly what to say and do in situations of courtship but for some reason I feel as if you can see right through me. I\u2019m over analyzing here but its this level of sincerity towards everything I\u2019m feeling that reassures me that this is real. \n\nYou have a boyfriend and I promise I won\u2019t homewreck but I\u2019m not surprised because no one as beautiful inside and out as you should ever be alone. I pray he knows how lucky he is and he always makes you smile because if ever I see a frown on your face I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to make you my world. Call me obsessive, call me crazy, just call me. \n\nI wish you knew that when I do or say something to amuse you that your smile makes my day. I wish it rained more and you forgot your umbrella so I can walk you to your car. I wish we can go on long drives and talk about anything and everything and at the end of the day we can go to IceKiss and share a dog bowl. I wish its my hand you hold as we watch fireworks at midnight and if I\u2019m lucky its my lips you kiss too. I wish there was an adjective to fully describe what you mean to me but up until then you\u2019re indescribable. What I really only wish for is that you\u2019re happy regardless if it were with me or not. I wish you knew\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t have a lot but the thought of making you happy makes me want to better myself and provide for you if I\u2019m lucky enough. All I can really do is be there and wait, even if all this waiting is for nothing. I\u2019m thankful for this feeling even though its one of the most painful things I\u2019ve ever felt. A painful feeling is better than no feeling because I was so sure that my heart froze and died a long time ago. Even if all these feelings are in vein with you it still leaves me hope that I can still feel for someone else (though ideally its you). As of right now this is everything I want to tell you but I hope there will be more. Maybe later, maybe tomorrow, maybe in months, maybe in years, maybe never, maybe forever.\n\nIf anyone is interested I made a video about my first love: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5FZ058PATQ\nThanks for reading "

Even though I'm pretty sure that was his whole reasoning for having us read this due to how powerful it is, it's really hard for me to handle it as a Catholic. I'm crying and I feel like I might throw up.\n\nI don't really know what else to say or what I want from this post, but I just had to get this out of my system since it's bothering me too much. God help these poor women and the doctors and nurses who perform these awful procedures. Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on us. Dearest Mother Mary, guide us and heal us. Fill us with compassion Lord, that we may not destroy and devalue the beautiful gift of life. Amen. \n\nPlease pray for these women and the author tonight with me. Thank you.\n\n**EDIT: I just received a private message from a user I will not name that said, \"For every abortion you don't have, I'll have three!\" Everyone, please pray for this individual as well. Humanity is so totally lost, and now more than ever, those who send these kinds of messages need God's mercy and guidance. Lord, may your love and mercy save this person's soul. Amen. "

I also feared that the priest at my church might criticize my wife and I for having put this off for so many years. Instead, he was incredibly warm and inviting, and during a meeting he informed us of our options.\n\nIt took us only 20 minutes to fill out the necessary paperwork to file for a radical sanation. The priest mailed it off for us and that was that. Today, I got the paperwork back from the bishop, informing me that our marriage is now recognized by the Catholic Church! I'm overjoyed.\n\nI'm going to have to prepare for my first confession in probably 15 or 16 years, and I have some definite fears about confessing some whoppers. Even so, I'm really excited to be able to take part in the sacraments again!"

Every time i stare into her eyes i can feel my heart grow bigger and my soul grow warmer. On those nights when you fell asleep in my arms, i felt closer to her than anyone else. It felt like her and I were the only ones in the world. Her eyes are like portals to another dimension where time freezes and it's just her and me. It's physically impossible to describe how I feel about her, but this will just have to suffice for now.\n\nPS: I've also learned that apparently my trench coat is more comfortable for her than even her own blankets, although i think she should be blaming Ikea for that one.\n\n"

I need people to know that love is a thing and it exists. Hold it together, lonely hearts.\n\nI am in love again. I've been in love with her since I first laid eyes upon her. Together. Apart. A thousand miles away. \n\nI am 44 now, I moved to a large city from a small town about twenty-three years ago and lived with a roommate. I knew him from high school, but that was about it for friends. Broke as hell, I'd sit in my room and listen to music, draw pictures and shuffle cards. I didn\u2019t even know how to play solitaire, I'd just shuffle over and over again. How\u2019s that for intensely lonely? Strange and solitary times for a few months. Pre-web. I'd hit a few bars but I was such a hick. I still am at heart. Zero game. It got pretty bad and I, normally a positive person, sunk into depression. This is how bad it was: I remember borrowing my roommates car one night to go and get what little groceries I could afford. Some lonely hearts/advice radio show came on and the caller asks the host \"Why do guys get your phone number and then never call you?\" I started to cry a little and shouted, \"I WOULD CALL YOU BACK!\" to nobody but myself. That is the level of desperation, just for some context.\n\n\tFast forward about 6 months, I'm sitting at the end of the bar in this local joint where my roommate works. He'd sling me free pints. There was a server there I'd been just crazy about since I'd seen her some time ago. Crazy about her, sure, but we'd never spoken. I'd gaze at her when she wasn't looking. Complete knockout. Just a vision. Such grace this woman, holding her own among the throng of drunken revellers every night. One night, after about 3 months of silently being in love with this unbelievably beautiful beast, I get too sloppy to look away in time. She turns to look at me, stone faced. She holds my gaze (a beat) then a huge smile breaks across her face like a crack in the clouds of a stormy sky. In this madhouse bar with animals shouting and hooting and hollering, glasses smashing, people shouting drink orders, this fucking light shines at me through it all. Just amazing. I smile back \u2018cause thats what my brain tells me to do, but in my head a jet engine roars. Amid the din within and without, my tiny internal voice squeaks WHATDOIDOWHATDOIDOWHATDOIDO? We stay locked and smiling for about ten seconds, which, for me was an eternity. Just forever. Hot rush as my balls shifted on their own in my pants, I don\u2019t go full hard-on, but my dick knows its in the conversation. Electricity shoots up my spine. My head swims and feels like its swelling up and yes I'm drunk, but you know how a baby can't hold its head up? I think I ought to leave before I say something stupid and ruin what I thought was an invitation to engage further. \nI had to get out of there and collect my thoughts. I finish my drink and bolt without her seeing me leave. Tryna be mysterious. \n\nI tossed and turned that night and barely slept. That smile, those lips. What would it be like to kiss her? What will I say? How will it go? I knew myself the day before and now I don't know who the fuck I even am. Was it nothing? Maybe it was nothing. Maybe we'll get married. Probably nothing. The WAR that went on in my head. Later that day my roommate went to work and said he\u2019d see me if I swung by. I decided I would. I show up about 11:30. Joint is in full swing and there she is as soon as I walk in. Any questions I had about what to do were gone. She walked by and turned to me, and I said \u201cHey you\u2026\u201d \u201cHi!\u201d, she replied enthusiastically. I was not wrong. I mean I was wrong but I was wrong about being wrong. I sidle up to the bar and start yapping with other customers, telling jokes, being the kind of guy I wished I could be for years. No nerves, no half-steppin'. I avoided looking at her most of the time so she wouldn\u2019t think I was a stalker. She might think I felt that she \u2018owed\u2019 me a conversation just because she smiled at me. Bars are funny places and servers have it tough with assholes. End of the night, place is empty. My roommate is counting cash behind the bar. She strolls in, ready to leave and asks if I\u2019m waiting for him. \u201cActually I'm waiting for you. Can I walk you home?\u201d I say, having zero knowledge of where this woman lived didn\u2019t enter into it. I\u2019d have walked her to Saturn. She smiled at me and said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Turns out her place was only about eight blocks from the bar and we chatted the whole way about where we were from and stuff we liked. Talked about the bar, my roomie, just casual shit. I happened to mention my fear of spiders. She asked if I wanted to come up and I said sure. We sat at the foot of her bed I met her cat. We laughed and yapped like we\u2019d known each other for years. She was whip-smart with an easy laugh. So bright, so beautiful. I could not believe my luck. She began to talk about spiders and I told her to stop because I don\u2019t even like the mention of them. She continued to push it until I kissed her to shut her up and Jesus Christ on a rubber crutch. I\u2019ve never ever seen fireworks behind my eyelids like that. She got the same thing because we stopped kissing, pulled away and looked at each other both thinking \u201cHoly fuck.\u201d \n\n\n\nLike a ton of bricks we fell. Like a house on fire. 2 years go by and we were in heaven. It was the most free either of us had ever been, and since. There was no pretence. No secrets. Nothing we couldn\u2019t share with each other. Fears. Warts. Abuse. Shitty things we\u2019d done in secret. Guilty pleasures. We made everyone around us sick with our googly-eyes and just pure glucose sugary sweet stupid love, unconditional love. \n\nI remember us laying on her bed one day, not even touching each other just sort of rolling around in our own weird electricity. All our hairs standing on end and goosebumps. So hard to explain. I don\u2019t know if there is anything scientific about it, but I felt like we were connected at a cellular level. She calls it spiritual. Us together was a spiritual experience. \n\nThere was another time we lay on her bed and that advice show came on the radio. She said, \u201cHaha, I called this show once\u2026\u201d \u201cI know\u2026\u201d I said. I immediately got goosebumps and the words spilled out without me even thinking. I was pointing at her now. \u201cYou called and asked why guys don\u2019t call you back after you give them your number.\u201d She stared at me, almost tearful and almost fearful. Quietly but incredulously, she spoke. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d Tears were welling up in both of us and I said, just as quietly, \u201cBecause I heard you, I heard you and I shouted out loud that I\u2019d call you back.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTo be continued\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I liked her for a while back in the fall and winter and I've known her for way longer but she had a boyfriend who really didn't deserve her. I knew we clicked really well but I didn't want to fuck up her relationship so I backed away.\n\nAfter I accepted the fact she wasn't going to see me as more than a \"good friend\" as long as she was with him, I stopped hanging out with her regularly. We were still friends but I just didn't seek her company anymore. Typing that out it feels kinda like I'm a shitty friend. \n\nFast forward 3-4 months to the end of May, they break up. We'd been hanging out again for probably the last month of their relationship and after they were done I was a little more open and close with her but I didn't realize it. \n\nA couple weeks later its prom night, we hung out during the dance (even though neither of us went) and we ended up getting drunk with my friend and his gf. Eventually our friends who went to the dance came back to the hotel we all got. She needed to pick something up from her car and I offered to come with. She eagerly accepted.\n\nWe took an uber to her car because it wasn't at the hotel, when we got in the back of the uber I got kinda close to her and put my arm around her. I wasn't too drunk but I was definitely buzzed. I turned to her and with no warning started making out/kissing her. She didn't oppose it and I still don't know if she thought I just did it because I was drunk or what, im really hoping that's not the case. I stopped, she put her head on my shoulder after a couple seconds. A few moments or minutes later, can't remember, I started doing it again. It was shorter than the first time but it was more passionate. I held the back/side of her neck, like they do in movies. It just felt so right. The alcohol kept the joy I felt at that moment inside but I wish I could've let her know how happy it made me. For the rest of the night we didn't talk about it but there was zero tension at all and as far as I know we didn't hook up again that night. When we party we kinda team up until one of us leaves so I was glad it didn't make things awkward for the rest of the night. \n\nThe next day I'm plagued by this feeling that I couldn't put my finger on. Kind of like an anxious feeling put not quite. It was less unpleasant but a lot more confusing than anxiety. I know that because I have it. But I realized that I could not stop thinking about her. I thought it may have been the hangover so I wrote it off as nothing. We ended up hanging out and smoking some weed later that day with another couple we were friends with. Everything's still cool, no weird vibes, awesome. After we split up I went home and went to bed. \n\nCome Monday I still have that weird feeling accompanied by the non-stop thoughts about her. Sometime on Monday I had the realization that I was deeply in love with this girl. The way I have felt since then has not changed and even when I thought it did a couple times, it was always there. It hasn't gone away. \n\nWe're almost best friends at this point but I haven't told her that I'm crazy about her. I'm not sure why but I think it's because I'm too afraid of losing her as a friend. But on the flip side I'm terrified of regretting not telling her how I truly feel. \n\nAnyway thanks for letting me rant. I'm relatively new here but this sub is great."

It's gross, but we're desperate. We finally break free and begin the long drive to the airport. She's tired so I gladly take the wheel of her mom's car. At one of the very last stoplights in town, we start kissing. *Hard.*\n\nIt was a supersensory combination, a spiritual experience akin to eating the world's most perfect green bean casserole, only the cream of mushroom soup has been replaced by a mix of psychedelic shrooms and leprechaun semen. Like legions of unicorn-riding gospel choirs were streaming into my ears in lockstep, like planets full of daffodils were exploding beneath my nostrils into celestial bouqets, like a million tiny, half-Asian polydactyl masseuses were gently working every ounce of tension out of my trembling frame, like seeing Christ himself appear before you. But he's wearing a tuxedo. Made of electric guitars. And bacon.\n\nIt was perfect. My bloodflow was instantly redirected southward. I closed my eyes, unable to see anything anyway due to the raging erection blocking my view (mine). It was at that exact moment when my foot slipped off the brake and we lurched into the 2008 Jeep Liberty just a few feet in front of us. It ruined the moment (but ended up not ruining our day!).\n\nNow I'm paying over 500 bucks out of my own pocket for that Jeep's repairs, which is completely absurd given the fact that my slip-up resulted in two small scratches. However, in the interest of being a gentleman, I refuse to have my girlfriend's mother's insurance premiums go up.

I'll start.\n\nThe person I have in mind is probably one of the kindest, most considerate person I have ever met, to the point where it's sometimes a weakness. It's pretty easy to take advantage of it, and I admit that even I did. But his kindness really affected me, and I've really wanted to change my ways to become a better person and be kinder to people, too. He's also very sincere and honest; everything he says, I can tell he really means it. And he has this childlike nature at times; he's not afraid to act a little goofy and have a little fun, and it's also a little embarassing but never fails to make people smile. Smiles.. His smiles, I love his smiles. My favourite ones are the ones that he makes for me when he notices me watching him play guitar in a room among our other friends, the ones that no one else notices and makes me feel like in that moment, there is only this connection. Very cheesy, I know.\n\nAnyone else wanna say something?"

And it's obvious that we both like one another.\n\nWhen I'm with her, I don't get the butterfly in tummy feelings, like in the movies. In fact, I only just want to care for her.\n\nNow, she's off to another country on a 2 week work stint. I'm missing her so deeply that I'm not able to sleep properly.\n\nIt feels terrible that she's not here. Only now, after so many years, had she made me realise, what it means to truly miss someone. \n\nI miss her so much that, she's been literally coming in my dreams for the past two nights. And in my dreams all she does is make me feel better. No kidding. \n\nIt's quite scary actually. I've never thought it's possible to yearn for someone so badly, that they will appear in your dream.\n\nThough I'm not entirely sure if this is really love, cause I've never loved anyone other person before besides my family. \n\nJust hope I'm not over-thinking or imagining stuff. Cause, that would mean I'll fall so hard and hurt myself REAL bad, as this would be my first time.\n\nWish me luck people!

Suddenly things go for a turn when she asks me if I do drugs... She asks if I can get some, and then asks \"what kind.\" I state, \"several, are you looking for something specific?\" She says, \"yeah clear lol\" \nAND it was at that moment I'm fucking glad I trust my gut feeling and NOT message the girls that run through my head!!

I won't go into details but I've aptly described it as my psyche is bleeding in conflict, isolation, defeat, abject loneliness, and hopelessness. \n\nBecause of particular circumstances, I didn't have the inclination to use other forms of consolation. I got to thinking about who I could possibly talk to. I'm tired of mental health lines who just want reassurance that they don't have to call police/ambulance before hurrying you off the phone and I only get to see my shrink once a week. \n\nSo, I thought of that song \"and the preacher likes the cold, cause he knows I'm gonna stay\" and also thought about popular culture references that seem to imply that Catholic churches are open for hours other than Sunday and Wednesday. So, I looked up a local one and read that they had something called adoration from morning until 9 pm. So, I hesitantly went there and sat quietly in a pew in their adoration chapel.\n\nIt was helpful. I sat there quietly (though, I may have made more noise than most there - I wasn't exactly prepared for the ear ringing silence and I shuffled around trying not to disturb others by breathing loudly or shifting in my seat). Again, I'm not religious/Catholic but sitting there, no phone, silence, and other people who were silent and calm and meditative(?) was extremely calming. I looked around. I was raised in a \"non-denominational\" protestant church by a mother who came from a Catholic family, so, I'm familiar with the Bible and the story of Jesus and who the virgin Mary is and all that. I kept my atheist thoughts to myself as I obviously wasn't praying - I was actually contemplating the look on the face of the virgin Mary and, suspending my disbelief about her actual existence, I was considering what her life may have been like to cause such a look with mixtures of indescernable emotions. \n\nAnd, just like that, for the first time in months, I felt the pleasant feeling of being tired calmly. I usually can't sleep and can't sleep until I hit my pillow at 2 am and fall unconscious until 7 the next morning. But for the first time in months I felt the pleasant feeling of a calm tired!!! I still feel comparatively peaceful and kinda relaxed.\n\nAnyway, I'm not looking to adopt any religion (I've spent a good amount of time thinking about religion in my life and have worked through the ins and outs of pro and con arguments and reached my conclusions). I'm also not looking to be disrespectful to anyone and their beliefs. I want to know, though:\n\n1) Am I being disrespectful by going into the admiration chapel, sitting quietly, looking at the cross/statues/pictures of what I assume are of the stations of the cross? I'm really not trying to intrude or upset anyone. I just haven't found another place with that sort of sense of calm and serenity. (Especially not at home, because of reasons irrelevant to this post). \n\n2) If it's OK for me to sit in there quietly and respectfully, are there some rules I'm supposed to follow? Do I have to back out of there without turning my back to the cross? (I also observed what others did in there.) Should I go ahead and kneel before leaving just to not have others perceive me as being rude?\n\nThank you."

To get into lab you had to have pants, closed toed shoes, and those terrible safety goggles. Well, we were the only two students out of a 100+ class without the proper attire, so we were sent back to our dorms to get our things. We ended up walking back together, and coincidentally lived on the same floor of the same dorm building. Once we collected our proper materials, we headed back to the lab and, once again another coincidence. Both our last names started with S and so we became lab partners. The two most unprepared students became lab partners. Great. That turned out not to be such a bad thing. We got close super fast. we studied together alot and over time things just connected. I still remover when I realized I was starting to like this boy. My sweat pants in lab turned to yoga pants.  My hair just alittle more neater than the regular messy braid. One night of studying particularly stands out. My roommate and I were studying in the commons area when I asked him to come out and study chemistry with me. Obviously chemistry wasn\u2019t studied, and we spent the next few hours talking about all our interests. They were fightenly similar. There was no way that this handsome kid liked broadway plays, traveling the world, geeking out to lord of the rings, or playing music? For sure he was just pulling my strings, just pretending to be interested in all the same things as me. Turns out, we really were just that similar. The first night when our feelings were revealed, I knew wed eventually end up together. He invited me over for a LOST marathon after a strenuous week of exams. We started off just slouching on his bed, obviously exhausted from studying and the mental warfare that is exam week. He began lying on the bed, and so i casually leaned into him. before i knew what was happening my head was on his chest and he had his arm around my waist. (he even planted tiny kisses on my head thinking i wouldn't notice. Believe me, i noticed). We laid together for hours, almost \"watching\" an entire season without even paying attention to the screen. We talked about everything and anything that came to mind. Thats my favorite thing about him, things are never boring, we can talk about anything. We often even debate and share our different opinions  on topics, which is great to find out more about eachother. So back to the story, there was obviously some unspoken tension. As i got up to leave he asked \"would i be break the rules if...\" and i kissed him before he could finish his sentence (\"would i be breaking the rules if i kissed you\" is what he meant to say). you see, i was in a crumbling relationship, and he had just broken up with his high school sweetheart. I dont think we planned on anything happening, it just all fell into place. were we breaking rules? definitely not. kissing someone had never felt so right. I cant remember being as excited about anything than that kiss. It was hard leaving his room after that, but I managed to run to my twin sisters room to gush about this amazing boy. Thinking back on that night it feels like a fairy tail. I consider it one of the best nights of my life. "

I said, \"That is not what love is, good sir. Love is the ever changing feeling of want. When you look at someone and can barely muster the strength to talk to them. When she looks at you and your heart races. All you want is to be around her at every moment. You can't stand to be away from her. You long to hold her and never let go. That, sir, is what love is.\n\nHe just sighed and began to walk away saying, \"Yet another one who doesn't understand, what a pity.\"\n\nI stopped him and asked him to explain.\n\nHe turned to me and stared me straight in the eyes. He began to speak. \"Do you believe that we as humans have souls?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, I guess. I'm not religious but I do believe that we have souls. Why?\"\n\n\"That is the first step to understanding. You see, the soul wants doesn't want a complete opposite, then it will constantly be at odds with another. But it also does not want a copy, then things will come too easy. The soul needs a counterpoint, a little bit of difference and a little bit of the same. It's very rare to find the perfect counterpoint but there may be a few in your lifetime. All it takes is a little effort. Once the counterpoint is found, the soul is internally conflicted. It cannot decide whether to be accept or dispel this counterpoint. These conflictions cause the heart to pound, the breath to shorten, the want to never let go. Uncontrollable nervousness.\"\n\n\"So what you're saying, good sir, is that the soul causes these wondrous feelings and we just call it love?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You, sir, have made me understand the roots of all love.

I think what needs to be grasped is that Catholicism, as a religion, is not some fancy country club or social grouping whose sole purpose is to fulfill emotional needs\u2014while it is an assembly of people, Catholicism is also a system of belief that advances claims as to what is true, and what is true is not at all dependent on the people making those claims. I cannot stand Donald Trump, but if he tomorrow were to say something like, \"The square root of 16 is 4,\" he would be right even though his basic mental competency is questionable\u2014and, perhaps a better example for our present purposes, he would even be more right if he were to affirm that \"rape is wrong,\" even though he himself, disgustingly, likes to \"grab [women] by the pussy\" without consent. A statement's truth is independent of the person who says it, and the fact that a small but not-insignificant percentage of Catholic clergy commit heinous acts emphatically does not mean that the truth-claims those people make are, by that fact, false.\nI think that there are good reasons to believe that Jesus was God and the Messiah of Israel, and that the doctrines of the Church are correct, irrespective of the conduct of the people who communicate those doctrines. I would however obviously prefer if those people were not involved in such egregious behavior.\nThere is widespread corruption in the Church, but there is also so much good in it, too\u2014it remains the world's largest charitable organization, operating more hospitals, schools, hospices, food banks, and homeless shelters than any other organization on the planet. For every abuser there are a hundred good priests who care for their communities, implement initiatives helping those in need, listen patiently to their congregants, work to advance the common good, and generally follow the gospel. It may seem like the whole organization is rotten, but it is not\u2014there is still so much good in the Church that often goes unreported and unrecognized. Good that you see only if you are involved in the day-to-day life of a Catholic parish, school, or university, or if you are one of the needy people who come to the Church's charitable institutions for help."

            "value": "I had a huge crush on you after hanging out at the conference.  Like the kind of crush where my peripheral vision went blurry and my brain stopped working when you were around.  Not even a jump your bones kind of crush but more the kind where I wanted to know if you liked squirrels or chipmunks better or what is your favorite type of penguin.  I guess I always had a crush on you but just managed it through keeping distance and really just being an asshole.  It's strange because I feel as if when we were hanging out we were both very guarded and I\u2019m not sure it was even that exciting.\n\nI think one of my best qualities is loyalty; especially to my children.  It feels (contrary to this) that it would have been a huge violation of trust to my family to do anything about it or even mention something in passing.  I know that even this is taboo and hope if you ever find this that you keep it confidential.  I also hope that you might still consider me a friend who has just been way too honest and should have shut up way sooner.  Regardless please trust that I will not make any advances or generally try to creep you out.  I'm not always professional but I can maintain boundaries.\n\nThis crush consumed me for weeks.  It was an emotional rollercoaster.  At first I was delighted.  I have not had those feelings in so long that when they all came rushing back I was on top of the world.  I told my friends that all they needed is to fall in love with their jobs or their house or their anything or everything.  It was the only answer to any of my problems overwhelming everything in my life.  Everyone noticed this.  My friends told me that I was glowing and my wife thought I was cheating on her (and hanging out that week did not help this).  Maybe I am cheating on her in some emotional fantasy type of way.\n\nThen reality set in.  I thought I was happily married with two children.  I don't believe in half ass commitments or living in shame so the only real options I have are nuclear.  The fallout would be substantial.  A drastic change with a potential to hurt everyone around me as well as myself.  I do have a weakness for fairy tale endings and believe with work anything can happen but in the end too risk averse to do anything.  Honestly I have no idea if you feel similar or even honestly what opinion you have of me.  Maybe that is a good thing.\n\nAlong with the constant thoughts and feelings came the introspection.  Why the hell is this happening now?  What is missing in my life and relationships?  How is it that I can be so selfish?  Why would I settle for nothing but perfection?  Did I settle and make a horrible mistake?\n\nYou know what? I think I actually figured a few things out.\n\nFirst, this might seem to be counter intuitive - but I figured out that I don't respect myself enough.  I take too much from the opinions of others and not enough of my own.  I think that I had this a while ago, but maybe I didn\u2019t and it was just young and invincible? After years of marriage and professional career with the get ahead and do it by the book mindset I wasn\u2019t doing what I need to be healthy and happy and needed to change this - so I did.  I started eating correctly and exercising regularly and reading again.  I stopped buying things that weren\u2019t tied to experiences.  I'm looking to mentor underprivileged guys and other opportunities to give back.  I feel a lot better.  I started dreaming vividly like I did in the past.  I had no idea how far I had gone downhill until I started regaining that lost spirit.\n\nI realized that there is a real gap in my marriage.  Something emotionally was not connecting anymore and needs to be fixed.  I started talking to my wife about this and we are trying to figure out together what we can do to remedy it.  I'm really not sure that it can be fixed but I want for the sake of my children a happy and functioning household and to work out those issues.  Our relationship has real problems that could be insurmountable.  We could just both have character conflicts that make us unhappy.  But I love my wife and I owe it to her and my family to try and make it work.\n\nFinally I am resolved to be more enthusiastic about life.  My theory is the best way to combat this existential crisis is to believe and take action. I know have finite time and limited choices and that scares the shit out of me but I will embrace those choices and this life with a bear hug and squeeze with everything I have.\n\nReally I what I want to do is thank you and let you know how awesome and beautiful you are.  You are, hands down the best person I know.  Probably without actually knowing you have made the biggest impact in my life in years.  Your attitude, enthusiasm and spirit will bring you incredibly far.  You should know that you are on the right path and should not compromise or have any regrets about what you know is right.  I'm sorry for the times I remained guarded and did not support you as much as I could.  Maybe circumstance could be different with time.  I know your future is bright and you will find the love and fulfillment that your looking for.  Keep your head up, you deserve it.\n"

One of the men started talking about his wife, and when he asked the other man about his wife, this is what was said.\n\n\"Man...I was 21 when I met her. I saw her from across the room and brother.....didn't nobody have to tell me who she was. I said 'there goes my wife', and the rest was history. That girl was something else, man. Every single day, I'd go and work for 12 hours and when I came home, she had dinner on the table waiting on me. After the kids were asleep, we were both so tired that we would go straight to bed just so we could hold each other. I was always content knowing that she was right there in my arms. I told her every night that as long as she was there, I was just fine. She was my queen, man. I told her that every day, she was the queen of my whole life. And my queen pushed me all the time to be the man I needed to be. She pushed me to seek God and follow Him and love Him with my whole heart, she pushed me to be a better daddy, and you can ask my little girls and they'll tell ya, we wouldn't be nowhere near where we are today if she didn't keep on making us better. Some folks just have a way of doing that, ya know? Some people just make you wanna be a better man. \n\nWell, one day, she started getting sick. I didn't worry too much at first, because everybody gets sick sometimes. But the doctors seemed to think it was something we should worry about. Well brother, they were right. She asked me if I would marry anyone else if she died. She worried about it. she couldn't imagine me being with another woman. I told her I could never have a second queen. But ya know what? She didn't believe me! That girl looked me in the eyes and said 'I know you better than that! You're the kind of man who needs a woman by his side. You couldn't be happy alone!'\n\nI looked her straight back in those big brown eyes and I said 'sugar, I don't need no woman in my life, I need you. You're the only one for me.'\n\nWell, after a year of fighting it, a lot had changed. There wasn't no more dinner on the table when I came home. Instead, I would work 12 hours a day, and I would come home. I would carry my wife out of bed and bring her to the table. I would cook dinner with her sitting there watching me, and we would just talk like nothing ever changed. Sometimes, we would sit and eat together and smile and just be happy that we could look at each other. On the bad days, I would feed her and she would cry and apologize, but I told her it was what I was there for. She was so sick, man. She was just so sick. She couldn't hardly do nothing. And she had to take medicine all the time, it was every 4 hours. So once we ate, I'd carry her back to bed and lay her down, and I would crawl in bed beside her and hold her just like I used to, and everything was ok. Just like I said before, it didn't matter what was going on, as long as I could hold her in my arms. But I could only lay with her for 4 hours at a time, because then I'd have to get up and bring her that medicine. But those 4 hours in between when I got to just be there beside her....man I wouldn't have traded that for nothing!\"\n\nThere was a long silence, a profound peace which none of us eavesdroppers dared disturb with our poorly disguised sniffles\n\n\"But the body can only handle so much, ya know,\" the man continued. \"It took 2 years of her being sick as a dog before it got the best of her. I saw it coming, and so did she. We both knew she wasn't coming back from it. But it still felt like it came outta nowhere. I mean....one day she's there in my arms, and the next day she's gone. It killed me at first, but it didn't take too long before I realized that she really was better off. She didn't have to take no more medicine, she didn't have to eat no more of my nasty cooking, all she had to worry about now was praising the Lord! \n\nYa know what still gets me though? Man, I don't know what to do about her stuff. I mean...I can't get rid of it. All her clothes are still in the closet, I got pictures of her everywhere, and her side of the bed is just how she left it. I wanna believe she's still here. My daughters tell me I should get it out of there and fix the place up, but I spent my life in that house with her. It's still our home, as far as I'm concerned.\"\n\nSilence again overtook the room. None of us had ever heard a man speak with such absolute respect and admiration. It was obvious that he had truly loved and adored that woman, and it wasn't changing any time soon.\n\nThe other old man broke the silence and said \"Man, that had to be so hard, though. I mean...taking care of her like that and having to do everything for her.\"\n\nA smile crept across the old man's face. His entire face lit up and he said,\n\n\"Brother, it was my privilege to be able to serve my queen for as long as I did.\""

That glow of non-rosy cheeks, crooked teeth, eyelids knitted together and broken laughter. Oh that laughter. It is sent from the heart bursting with happiness and believe me I've felt it. He will feel it too, pure happiness anyone can tell. It will be strange and even to me too, as I've only witnessed it once or twice. He will understand that this laughter is so powerful that it will shatter my armours and even if my body is still standing guard that my voice will betray me. The way it shakes and cracks and deepen while holding all my secrets at the tip of my tongue. No longer smooth and silky, how the lies would roll out from my mouth. Knowing that this man has the ability to unveil my petals and unravel me from the Earth that I have carefully rooted myself in. \n\nHe would not study me like a book for I will be not stored on a shelf, or a diary to be locked up only to be visited once or twice when his emotions are wild with desire or anger, no. I am not a novel to serve a purpose. I am a woman, almost the same as him. No complexities just the same desire to love and to be loved. He will draw me with the same intensity his lungs would draw in air after a run. Though I can confirm I am not the most beautiful woman, he will tell you otherwise. No matter how far he runs, there is always a longer track, just like no matter how much he draws, he can never find a way to complete the picture, there is just too much beauty to capture. I don't mean you, he will say \"when we're together,\" hopefully our story never ends just like this picture. He turned into a long distance runner, knowing with each expansion of his chest, we are getting more and more intertwined like thorns and vines.\n\nWhat really happened when the possibility of attraction struck: https://m.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/4lfx5h/love_when_you_lay_down_your_weapons/?utm_source=mweb_redirect"

This message was just a simple hello, her letting me know she remade her profile and was back online; we had only ever chatted here and there online nothing serious because I was too afraid to tell her I liked her a lot, the fantasy in my head was to special to risk getting shot down and extinguished entirely; that and she is so beautiful I knew I never had a chance, not with all the other guys online.\n\n\nI causally responded with a \"thanks for letting me know your cute butt was back online\" I believe that may have been the catalyst that got everything rolling the way it did. It's at this time I will mention that she is from the USA and I am from Canada, but at the time of these exchanges I was in Europe for a couple weeks. We had exchanged the first couple messages when I was staying in a little town in Poland called Dabrowa Bialostocka; translation middle of fucking nowhere with almost zero internet connection. Fast forward a couple days later and I checked into my apartment in Warsaw, first thing I did was get on the internet and shoot her back a message that was cooking in my inbox for a couple days longer that I would have liked as well as added her to Skype, then I went about touring in Warsaw seeing the sites and loving the culture.\n\n\nMy next day in Warsaw I met my cousin who I had never met before, we went to some museums and finished the day with a wonderful dinner at a quiet neighborhood restaurant, after diner he suggested we get to know each other the traditional Polish way, over a bottle of Vodka. We drank until 1 or 2am; after getting properly sauced and getting to know each other he jumped in a cab back home and I had planned to go to bed, but before hitting the hay I checked my iPad really quick to see what my friend back home were getting up too, that's when I opened my Skype to see her online; now I am not sure exactly how the conversation went or how it started but I do remember some key points, at one point I had an argument with myself in my head of course; you ever heard the saying drunk words are sober thoughts? Well I laid it out right there and then I typed simply \"I like you and I have for quite sometime\" there was no response for a minute or two, the tension sobered me up quite a bit as I had come to terms with what I had done, when she responded she said \"really?\" I was devastated, because I took that as a \"really? ewww\" but then she said \"I hope your not joking because I really like you too\".\n\n\nThat sentence hit me like a ton of bricks, it turns out that the whole time I was creeping her page and writing her messages that I deleted before ever sending she was doing the exact same thing. I was in a state of shock because this sort of stuff just does not happen in real life. From there the conversation became very deep and very long; at one point I looked up and it was light outside I checked my clock and it was 5am, I reluctantly told her I had to go and try and get some sleep, after signing off I walked over to the open balcony and looked out over the city, the architecture of Old Town Warsaw bathed in the gold of the early morning sun embraced by the cool summer air. I had never been happier.\n\n\nWe continued to talk online, every word, every sentence brought me an amazing feeling of happiness and contentment. This is when I decided that I wanted to show her that I was not just some chump online, I had already booked a trip to the USA for a conference after I returned from Europe, but I told her that if she wanted I would reschedule my flight to her home town and spend a couple days hanging out in person; she agreed. Lets fast forward a bit to my arrival in Wolfsburg Germany my Polish SIM card would no longer provide me with internet here and I couldn't find a pre-pay data SIM card in Germany so I did the only logical thing, I purchased internet at the hotel I was staying in at a cost of 30 euro a day.\n\n\nLets again jump in the time machine and jump forward a couple more days to my arrival back in Canada. I had two weeks of work before my flight to the USA and my anticipation was hitting levels near critical mass; I thought great when I mean her I am going to be a blubbering sweating mess; the closer I got however the more relaxed I felt that was until after landing on US soil and turning my phone on I received a text that said \"I just saw your plane land\" as I walked down the long hallway to the airport terminal people were hurrying past me and I could see them being greeted by loved ones, I walked slower I had a lump in my throat and I was sweating bullets. When I got to the end of the hall I stopped, and that is when I glanced over to my right; there she was standing by the wall looking adorable as can be we locked eyes and froze, I don't have the words to describe the rush of emotions that washed over me but she must have felt it too because there were no words needed between us all we had to do was hug and it was at that moment I recall being at peace with myself and with life. I felt like I had known her my whole life, I shed a tear.\n\n\nI won't go into much detail about how we spent the next 5 days but it was the time of my life, those days were pure magic, a sense of attraction and belonging I had never felt before. When it came time to leave however; it was much more difficult than I could have ever imagined, by the time I got to her front door I was full on tears and she was close behind, I had never felt emotion so beautiful and so completely devastating as that moment right there knowing in a couple minutes we would be apart. I managed to pull myself together long enough to say a proper good-bye and get into my rental car, but that only lasted until I was out of her driveway; I cried my eyes out the whole way to the airport, not even too sure how I managed to get there, I cried at the check-in desk, at the security check point, at the gate waiting for my plane, the entire plane ride back to Canada and as I sit here typing this right now I am crying at the beautiful memory I am left with.\nNever did I think I would feel this way about another person or have them feel this way about me, I was always familiar with crying about being unhappy or lonely never did I think it was possible to cry tears of happiness.\n\nMaking a long story short a week or two after I got back home we made plans for her to come visit me and I bought her a plane ticket for December 8th. Although I know I have something amazing to look forward to some nights are hard, and as much as I want to scream from the roof tops how amazing this girl makes me feel I cannot, so instead reddit I scream it to you.\n\n\nI LOVE THIS GIRL!\n\n\nI never thought in my entire lifetime I would fall in love, less yet did I think I would fall in love with the girl of my dreams and have her fall in love with me."

I liked him at that time, but so did my friend... so I declined. Then I went away for the summer and when I got back, he went off to camp. So the two of us didn't talk for about two months. When we started talking, we became best friends. He knew everything about me, and I knew everything about him. He knew the reasons I turned him down even though I liked him, and he told me that he was in love with me. Everyone said that we should go out, and many  people said that we were best friends who were dating but wouldn't admit it. On 11/11 he came over and it was really nice. It was one of the perfect moments in life, one that I would do anything for again. After summer to New Years Eve, he was perfect and I fell in love with him. This was the first time I've fell in love, and the first time that he fell in love was with me as well. On New Years Eve, I told him that I still really liked him (even though I knew he wasn't going to say yes -- but I needed the closure of everything). He said that it could never work out because he was too afraid to lose/hurt me and that we both needed to move on with our lives. Afterwards, things were a little awkward, but that was expected. Then  we just started ignoring/avoiding each other. We didn't talk, and tried to see each other as little as possible, even though all of our friends were the same and we had lunch together every day. He was being more of a jerk, and I was being really distant with everyone. Finally (about a month later), we got together and sat down and talked. We said how we needed to figure out a way to become civil with each other and hopefully friends. It's been a month since then, and even though its less avoidance, we still do not talk or hang out. I miss my best friend. I have moved on in the sense of, I understand that we will never date and I am fine with that. I have also realized that he has a lot of flaws that I knew before, but over looked. I want my best friend back, the guy who I can tell everything to. He was my first REAL best friend, the first person who I would trust with my life. \n\nThis was the first time that I opened my heart. I spent all my life sheltering my heart, because I was too afraid to get hurt. And that ended up hurting me... A part of me will always love him, just because we never got the chance to see what we would have been like together. I will always love him, but I am no longer in love with him. However, I do want him back as a best friend. I just want him back to be someone who I talk to on a daily basis. And someone who I can tell everything to. We use to be able to talk hours on end... and now its hard to keep a few minutes of conversation. Help?"

I also write regularly for Aleteia.\n\nMy story in a nutshell: \n\nI was raised in a very Catholic home. My dad is a theologian and my mom, for most of my childhood, stayed at home. I was very serious about my faith as a child but as a teenager, my doubts and struggles with the problem of suffering pushed me to become an atheist. \n\nI stopped going to church unless I was forced. I got into the punk rock scene and social activism. I wanted to be a good person, but I did not think I needed religion to do that. I had seen quite a few Christians give bad example and I reasoned that religion had not helped them to become good people. \n\nI eventually went to school at a women's college in the Northeast. I was active in animal rights and became a vegan. In college, I started to explore spirituality again but really only so I could say I had tested it all and found it lacking. I learned about Buddhism, started meditating, and even met the Dalai Lama but still did not believe in God. I also went to Quaker meetings regularly for a while. \n\nI was hungry for truth, and I was searching but I still considered myself an atheist because I had not found any convincing evidence or arguments that God existed. Finally, several years after college, I took some time off to travel. In Costa Rica, I worked for three months on a farm in a rural area. I was quietly evangelized by the faithful people in the town and one day while walking to work early in the morning, I had an instantaneous conversion (to belief in God). At that moment, I know that 1. God existed, 2. That he loved me, and 3. That God had a plan for my life.\n\nYou can listen to the complete story [here](https://soundcloud.com/st-michael-radio/sr-theresa-nobles-conversion-story-from-atheist-to-nun).\n\nI am happy to answer any questions you have about my conversion, inviting loved ones back to the Church, discerning a religious vocation, or really anything else.\n\nFeel free to post any questions you have and I will be back at 2PM est on May 13th, the Feast of Our Lady of Fatima, to answer as many as I am able to in an hour!\n\nMary Queen of Apostles, *pray for us.*"

All the clich\u00e9s, they're true, all those songs and movies are true, it's all real. You're literally my dream come true, I woke up one morning knowing you were the part I was missing. A year and a half ago you said yes to me after seven years of friendship, and made me yours. Every time I think it can't get any better, it does. I thought the world had not much left to show me but you made it new again. I can't wait for all our adventures. I love you fiercely. I never imagined I'd love anyone like this, or that it would be you, but I'm so glad it's you. I want to grasp every moment now because every one of them is infinitely precious now you're with me. You are so strong and caring and patient with me and you've healed all the things inside of me I thought were beyond hope, all that pain I clung to. I thought I was too damaged. You proved me wrong. You never have to doubt that I'm your girl and that I love you because I will spend my last moment on this earth loving you. I've waited my whole life for you without even knowing it, and I'm never letting you go. Every day I hope I can love you better than the day before it, every day I hope I'm a better girlfriend to you and one day, my hope of hopes, a better wife. I will lift you up and I will laugh with you every day and I will always look at you like you're the beginning and the end of my world, because you are, and you have made this world beautiful for me again. \n\n... But all of this terrifies the absolute feck out of me, so I sit here praying that one day I can not be so utterly scared to say how much I love you. The words carry more weight and emotion than I can bear, and they've never meant so much and yet somehow expressed so little. I guess I'll just have to show it in every way I can instead. "

She completely changed my life, but she was going to leave on a trip later that year for a long time, and so we couldn't really have a real relationship. After a few months of dating, she left me. I had never told her that I loved her and she completely vanished from my life. We're now 5 years later, and she resurfaced. I spoke to her out of the blue and she seemed kind of willing to go on a date. But she cancelled at the last minute and we haven't spoken since. That was 3 weeks ago. So I wrote down what I wanted to tell her, but probably never will. I wont see her ever again. So I wanted to share it anyway, and here it is:\n\n*Sit tight, this one is long and slightly complicated but it all comes together in the end, I promise.*\n\n*You know how I am allergic to nuts and peanuts right? You know, in my youth I was angry a lot. Angry that I was allergic, angry that I was different, angry that I was powerless, angry and lonely. I hated myself and wanted to die ever since I had my first allergic reaction at the tender age of 9. That event has traumatised me. It gave me a taste of what life had for me. I was going to live in a state of perpetual terror and someday suffocate to death. I was upset. I wanted to die any other way than by my allergy, that was to be my own way of \u201cwinning\u201d. At first I didn\u2019t have the courage to end myself, then after my near-death experience at the age of 13, I rebelled. It seemed too unfair that my life was going to be lived so pointlessly, without any hope of it getting any better. A peanut allergy is a life sentence to what seems like an eternity of fear, stress and pain. And there was nothing to free me but death. So to kill myself was to rebel in the name of freedom. But in my revolt I decided that dying any other way than by my allergies wasn\u2019t good enough, I needed to give my death a meaning so as to avenge myself for such a meaningless life.*\n\n*Being a romantic kid with a taste for epic heroic tales, it became my greatest dream to die saving someone whose life was worth living. I would find any way to sacrifice myself to save the life of a woman, and then die in her arms, revealing her with my last breath the love I felt for her. I pursued that dream all the way into adulthood, when, just before turning 18, I met J. I loved her and I wanted to die for her. That was it, she was the one whose life had a value, the one in whose arms I would die. I became her puppet, her puppy, her carry-on bag. Everywhere she went I came with, as a friend. The internets would say that those 8 months I spent by her side were the very definition of the friendzone. But I was fine with that, I was awaiting the occasion to save her life by giving mine. As it turned out, not a lot of people wanted to kill a beautiful 18 years old innocent girl in the rather calm city of G. I couldn\u2019t catch a bullet for her, push her off the rails or brave a fire for her. I wasn\u2019t getting any chance to die for her anytime soon.*\n\n*And so time went on and my homies, who knew how I felt about her -not the part where I wanted to die, but the part where I loved her- they decided to \u201chelp me out\u201d. They incited her to give me a chance that I had never asked for. It hadn\u2019t ever been in my intention to become her boyfriend, but when she held my hand I couldn\u2019t let go. I gave it a try and it failed horribly. After two short weeks, she gave up on me. It was a bittersweet relief. Though thankful that it was over, I couldn\u2019t help but realize that the magic had gone and I felt a void inside where my love used to burn. I had to find love again. Actually, I was not just looking for love this time, I wouldn\u2019t have endured to settle for anything less than a woman who fitted my  ideals perfectly. I had to find \u201cthe one\u201d.* \n\n*Little did I know, I already had. We had met at the beginning of the summer, you and I. Long story short, when we ran into each other again, it was a fabulous coincidence that eventually lead me to realize that you were the one. But in realizing that, it also struck me that I didn\u2019t want to die for you. I wanted to live for you. Invest every living breath in nourishing the flames of my love for you.* \n\n*Relax, this is not a proposal, it\u2019s not what you think, let me finish.* \n\n*Along with this new desire to live came the realization that I was not prepared to live. I had never tried to better myself, I wasn\u2019t a noble hero worthy of living a lifetime alongside his soulmate. It had always been as easy as sacrificing everything I had within a few moments to achieve the ultimate act of love, and in doing so, the ultimate act of rebellion. But you made me want to live. And I couldn\u2019t feel deserving of your love without being as perfect as I made you out to be. It\u2019s probably why I held back so much and why I didn\u2019t kiss you for the first 3 months we had been seeing each other.* \n\n*I held back so much in fact, that you probably never felt like I wanted to commit to the relationship. I never told you that I loved you. I never told you how much you inspired me. How much you motivated me. How much you meant to me. I never got to tell you any of this before you left me.* \n\n*But I wasn\u2019t angry or sad that you did. It was painful, sure, but it was also a relief, because I now had time to work on myself until we\u2019d meet again. I wanted to be the perfect man. But where to start? How do you even define what a perfect man is?*\n\n*My quest for perfection has lead me astray. I have wandered to places too dark, figuratively and literally. There is an inherent danger in the passionate pursuit of moral righteousness in that fighting evil relentlessly can spiral anyone into a whirlpool of anger and hatred. The hatred for evil, though one may judge it justified in its essence, it blinds the mind. And it got me to the edge where I walked upon the border where sanity meets insanity. It\u2019s a thin and blurry line that separates the two. But I eventually found my way back to your light. It had been a very long trip, and I lost a lot of friends and a lot of respect from others along the way. But I am better now than I have ever been.* \n\n*I\u2019ve found other reasons to live. In part thanks to you. You have sown the seeds of passion in my heart. Passion for travel, for experiences, for happiness. I live for sports, for good story books and beautiful tales. I live to improve myself. I live because I (finally) want to.* \n\n*In the end, all I really wanted to say is... thank you. And whether or not our paths meet again is not a concern to me. This confession kind of was the last rock pressing on my chest, the last bond that kept me from completely moving on. I\u2019m happy, and I wish you to be. Just know that if you knock to my door I\u2019ll be there, for whatever it is that you need, I feel I owe you this much.*\n\n*Have a great life.*"

I am a very conservative person and was brought up in the Presbyterian Church (USA) but left the church when I realized it was becoming too liberal. I then began attending a Church of the Brethren. Now I am in my second semester of college and through my own intellectual curiosity, I discovered Catholicism and Orthodoxy. Well, not discovered, but actually began reading about them from a non-discriminatory, objective perspective. Slowly, my bias against Catholicism and Orthodoxy began to crumble and I saw them both as valid Christianity. But it didn't stop there. I came to the realization that after reading church history, ancient church doctrine, and diving deeper into the Scriptures that I could not be Protestant anymore. It was impossible. Either the Catholic or Orthodox church had to be the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church of Christ, but I didn't know which one. I had been handed all this information and now felt like it was my time to simply guess and hope I guessed right. I didn't want it to boil down to what I preferred. I wanted the 100% objective truth. I posted here and also in /r/OrthodoxChristianity about my problem and people began to give me feedback, but I still felt conflicted. So I cried out to God and told Him that if He would show me the true church, I would forsake all my personal bias and preferences and go where He would point me. Two weeks after I prayed this, He answered me (and made it very obvious).\n\nFriends, I am converting to Catholicism. I cannot tell you the joy that I feel, and I cannot tell what wonder I have for God right now. Now that I am becoming Catholic, suddenly everywhere in my life I see where there was divine intervention, even when I was a child. I see that everything I have experienced in my 18 years of life has been leading up to this. And with this, much of my anxiety that I have struggled with since middle school has all but vanished because I know have found true meaning in my life. My lifelong movement from a hard-core, Sola Fide, Sola Scriptura, Reformed, anti-Catholic Presbyterian to a Catholic has been nothing coincidental. I honestly wish I could tell each and everyone one of you the full story but it would take me hours to write. I want to thank everyone here who provided me with information and prayers, and I cannot tell you how much I am looking forward to joining the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. \n\nGod bless you all!"

While this might be considered typical in many young males my age, I found myself wanting something different... which I quickly found several times through out the world.\n\nWe'll call her \"Ellie\". Ellie and I met under the Eiffel Tower in France; there, almost instantaneously, we made an incredible emotional connection. Our conversation flowed effortlessly, to the point where if we weren't traveling, I would consider moving things (over time of course) to a more serious level. We did everything from paint one another with hearts, talked about our hopes and dreams, to even sharing the most beautiful kiss during sunset atop this fantasy-esque bridge. It was something out of a movie, yet I was fine with the knowledge that it wouldn't last forever. In fact, the beauty of it came from the fleeting moments we had left to share. Long story short, she left the next day, but we had both expressed to one another that we had feelings of love, and in the right circumstance, it could have moved further...\n\nTLDR: Ellie and I both made an amazing emotional connection, but recognized it would not last for more than a day. And this is now what I seek from places where I know I won't be able to settle down. \n\nHave any other users experienced an internal desire to look for \"emotional hookups\" as opposed to sexual hookups? It was very Titanic-esque in its feeling, and in fact, I was happy that it didn't advance to a sexual level. The fact that we had created a beautiful emotional connection in such a short amount of time was... breathtaking...\n\nI experienced this three times through out the world; each time with another woman. We all created beautiful, ephemeral, \"romantic\" moments together, and they've provided for internal happiness than any sexual hookup I've ever experienced! "

He converted to Catholicism not long after meeting me. I was over the moon. Everything was good. Then suddenly, a small voice in my head started bothering me. It told me that I was possibly holding this man back from his true vocation. After all, he didn\u2019t get the same kind of discernment period that I got- free from the attachment of dating. I was worried that if his true calling was becoming a priest or such, he would ignore it to stay with me. \n\nAt first, I tried ignoring the voice that said I was an impediment, but finally I turned to you. It sounded so silly, didn\u2019t it? But I was worried. Was I supposed to break up with him so he could \u201cproperly\u201d discern? You all gave me a resounding \u201cno!\u201d \n\nI was so thankful and relieved. Thank you for reassuring me. \n\nWhere are we now? We\u2019re married. I\u2019m married to that amazing man. Almost two years now. We have one beautiful child, another on the way, and one that was lost several months ago. \n\nI just wanted to let you know what happened to us and how much God has blessed our relationship. Maybe if you have the space in your long list of intentions, you can find the time to pray for the baby we lost and for the one I\u2019m currently growing in me. \n\nThank you so much. I appreciate this community so much and lurk here every day. \n\n"

But when you smile at me it sends waves of joy through me that fuel the fire that burns in my heart. My fingers itch to touch you, to please you. My mouth aches for you and turns up in a smile to respond to yours. But honestly, its all I can do to wrap my head around how wonderful you are, and the impossible possibility that you and I have finally found each other. Because I know in the deepest parts of me that you are meant to be with me. And I will always do my best to make you happy , just like you do for me. You make sense of all those questions ive so often wondered about love: why people go to such lengths for it? Go through so much in the hopes that there love might begin to feel like ours does. When you wrap your arms around me at night and hold me to you, everything in the entire world feels right. I love you so much, somedays it's hard to breath. "

Let it be the force that drives you to be better. Most of all, love yourself,  no one will ever love you like you love yourself. Your awesome, I promise.\n\nAnd when you loose love remember that it is no loss at all, for it is better to love and lost than never loved at all. That when love leaves this world(like we all will) that the best way to honor them is to be as strong as you can. If you can't fight for yourself, then fight to keep their memory alive.\n\nThat love comes with responsibility, what will be for you to decide. Love your worst enemy, because you can't truley understand someone until you've loved them. \n\nIf you haven't found love, be patient, be kind, and always ask questions. \n\nLove & Peace friends."

I was recently elected to the executive board of your run-of-the-mill student group to do the marketing BS that goes along with it. He was returning to be an exec for his second year. I walked into the room, we locked eyes, and the sound of brakes screeching rattled around in my skull. \n\nAfter that first meeting, he waited for me and we ended up talking for an hour before dragging ourselves to our respective A.M. classes. And, jesus, did we hit it off. I tried to quell my primal urges......which worked for 4 weeks or so. Then, he invited me out.\n\nA couple of hours of surfing turned into a night at a local bar. And, many laughs, a few dances, and several drinks later, we ended up back at my place. That night would kick off 9 months of the steamiest (and most fulfilling) friends-with-benefits situation I had ever even heard about. \n\nWe would meet for parking lot rendezvous in the middle of the day to tear each other's clothes off, and at night he would make me dinner and we'd share a six pack and laugh at obscure sketch comedy. He was the only one I trusted to cry in front of when a family member fell very ill, and I was more myself around him than anyone else. I fell for him so hard, but was afraid to tamper with the sanctity of the friends-with-bennies unstated agreement (you know the one), so I remained silent. Little did I know, he was sworn to secrecy for the exact same reasons. \n\nAfter months of choking down my desires and desperately searching for any sign of reciprocity, I met someone. He was sweet, innocent, and--most importantly--spoke with conviction about how he felt. Assuming that my \"friend\" was fine with remaining as such, I made it official with the new man. \n\nOnly a couple of days after the facebook status went active, heralding the official relationship, I received a long heart-wrenching email from the friend. He said that he had been in love with me but afraid to express it for fear of scaring me away, and that if he had known that I would be receptive to having a romantic connection, he would have been the first to jump in line. \n\nI was crushed. I sat on my floor and cried. And, without thinking it through, drove an hour to his house for what I can only describe now as a pathetic attempt at gaining clarity. He greeted me with a tender smile, we sat on the cliffs of the beach, drank bourbon, and let all of the pent up, emotional angst come out. At sunset, when I couldn't take it anymore, I kissed him. A deep, meaningful one with classy amounts of tongue. But...it was a kiss goodbye. \n\nI know...I know... You're thinking, \"Really? REALLY?! What do you mean  'goodbye'?! Are you stupid?\" \n\nYeah...yeah I am. \n\nI suppose I was shy around him. How could I trust that he'd be open with me from now on, especially after having another young man pour his heart out to me so readily? Yep...not airtight logic, that's for sure.\n\nAnyway, we talked a few more times--saying we'd remain friends--and eventually lost contact for two years. Since then, we'd both graduated from college, I'd moved to the opposite coast, and we were both in relationships. \n\n(Here's the good part!)\n\nOne day I was reflecting on my impending medical school applications. I remembered all of the folks I started the journey with and was curious as to who had made it through. After going through my phone, I stumbled upon his number and smiled. And, after two years, I gave him a call. \n\nThe phone rang forever, but when he picked it up, I could hear him smiling. The first conversation was cut short by an evening class of mine, but BANG instant chemistry.\n\nWe promised to talk again, and we did. For four hours. And again. And again. It became readily apparent to us both that we had been harboring latent love for the two years of silence. We finally let all of our baggage from our jaded end come to the surface and were finally honest. About everything. And have since maintained that tradition. Interestingly enough, we also found out that both of our relationships were going downhill. \"Wouldn't it be strange if we were both single at the same time?\"  .................Yes. Yes, it would. \n\nWell, it happened. And we met at the airport for the first time in 2 and a half years with smiles, and smooches, and sweet embracing. It was a love shit show. \n\nTo make a long story longer, we're now dating. And I've never felt so satisfied in my life. Being together--finally--is so easy. It fits. Perfectly. And, it is such a long time coming. My folks love him, I love him, and it's disgustingly, absurdly amazing. He's moving out here to live with me prior to the start of his medical school (yes, he got in! yay!) so that we can make a good go at things. Depending upon how it goes, my own medical school location will probably be dictated on, within reason, his whereabouts. \n\n**TLDR: Those outrageously annoying sayings, \"If it's meant to be, you'll find each other again\" may actually be true. Girl meets boy. Girl loses boy. Boy and girl reunite after two years of silence to enact Happily Ever After. But, heed my warning: don't let time pass wondering whether or not you should be honest with the person you care about. 99.9% of folks don't get a second chance.**"

            "value": "So there's this girl right? Like how all these stupid stories start. Anyways, this girl, I've learned so much about her in the last year. I met her at my job, she was an intelligent girl who is two years younger than I, I'm 22, and she was a resident at the building I worked at, while I was just the valet boy. No I didn't valet her car, because she rode a motorcycle, but I always saw her ride off and come home on it. Since I never got to have a conversation with her like I did with the residents who would valet their car, I left my number on her bike one night and the next day I saw the little paper I left on her bike in a little oil puddle on the floor. I forgot about it and said whatever right? Well I could go on and lie about how I ran into her at some shitty coffee shop in downtown Denver, but I actually just looked up her name on Facebook and found her. I sent her a message and waited. And waited and waited. Until about a month and a half went by and during a cold snow night I hear my phone go off and I think..who the fuck is this messaging me this late? It was her. I literally jumped out of my fucking pants with joy and looked at the notification for about an hour because I had no idea what to say. Eventually I opened the message and she said everything I said was really sweet and that she recognized me as the valet boy. Over time it seemed like she had interest. She said that she liked me and said that I was cute and that I made her laugh. I felt like it was all too good to be true. A night before winter actually hit, she asked me if I wanted to come over and of course I said yes. She talked, had a drink or two, and then said she wanted to lay down and I asked if I could join her and she said yes. We laid side by side awkwardly for about a minute or two and her and I just looked at each other and kissed. She grabbed on to me and I grabbed on to her, running my hands along her back while she grabbed on to my hair. She smiled with her big green eyes and put her head against my chest and told me that she felt happy as she laughed and kissed me again and again. She told me to come over again tomorrow because her friends were going to be over at her place and she wanted me to meet them, so I agreed and came back the next night. Feeling like a total MAN going over the night next after work, I met her at her place, and gave her a hug and lifted her off the ground and she smiled at me as her eyes widened. We got to her apartment and I met all her friends. Good music, good drinks, good people all together and she came over and set next to me. I was having a great time and thought, wow I can't believe I'm here, I feel so happy. Then, all of a sudden this other dude, who was also her friend, started hitting on her and touching her left and she started to lay her head against his shoulder. I felt my whole happiness just start to crumble. I looked to my left and saw a bottle of Jose and some cheap vodka that was on the coffee table and drank them both until my vision started to fade. The lights turned off and her friends fell asleep and I was laying down on her floor turned away but I could still hear them talk quietly. I'm not going to lie, but I quietly cried on her floor. I saw their shadows on the wall get up and move to the bed and that was when I just balled on her hard wood floor(quietly of course). It was too late to call my friends to come get me and the trains weren't running yet so I just drunkenly cried myself to sleep. I woke up feeling awful, I woke up like nothing was wrong and let me honest, I looked like an absolute wreck. All her friends left the place and it was just her and I and I just sat their not saying a work. Just looking out the window of her downtown apartment. She asked if I was ok and I said that I think that it's time for me to go. She gave me a kiss but I just kind of looked away and I left. It was cold that morning, it snowed the night before and the sun was out so it felt even worse. We stopped talking and we went our own ways, I bought a car, I got a good part of my life together and I felt really good once spring came around. Forgot about her and started talking to others, on the side of my mind I always thought about her from time to time but I didn't think too much into it. Well I get back from vacation in June, and I see her pop up on my Facebook and I messaged her and said hi. We took it slow and talked about random things. I eventually told her why I left and she told me that she was sorry. We messaged each other longer this time before we met up again. We became pretty decent friends and I learned alot from her. I got into motorcycles because of her and more importantly, I found a passion in programming from her as well. She still laughed at my stupid jokes and said that she liked me but that we should just be friends because she doesn't want a relationship and even though I could feel myself start to gain feelings for her again, I agreed with her and we remained friends. Over time it was like little 10 minute meet up at a shitty coffee shop. I would just sink my eyes into her and listen to her speak. I could feel myself falling in love with her. One night I asked if I could go over and she said, not tonight, which was fine. I know she's a busy girl and I went back to my phone after about 10 minutes and she said, you can come over for a little bit. I felt really happy because I get to see her obviously. I leave work, stand and look up at the 49 story skyscraper she lives in in the center of downtown. (yeah she's pretty successful) we go up to her floor and we talk for awhile, listen to music and laugh. She said, I want to lay down, and of course...I ask if I can lay down with her and she says yes. I grab on to her and she grabs on to my hand and we kiss. We miss for a while and she says, ok I think its time for you to leave and I get up, out my shoes on and she grabs my arm and kissed me and says, I thought I told you to leave? I tell her, you're the one pulling me back. She looked at me with her big green eyes and pulls me back into bed with her and we start full on making out and this is going to sound funny, but I literally start dry humping her while we're still dressed. I lift her shirt and bra up and she takes my shirt off and I start kissing her chest and pull on her hair and she let's put these soft moans. I kiss her down her stomach and unbutton her pants and she pulls me back up and smiles and jumps into my arms and kisses me all over my face. Again I thought, I am so happy, I feel so alive. After all of that, we both fall asleep and she wakes me up around 7am and says that I should probably go. But with a cute smile and kisses me again. So I leave and I feel fucking awesome. Like wow, I feel like my whole world is just right side up. Everything is fine for a while, great actually. Then everyday since like last week or so she just sounds so uninterested. Like she could careless about me even existing. I notice it right off the bat too and I mean sometimes she has that little spark of interest again. But today, this morning after I get off my graveyard shift, I am driving home and I'm feeling really low again. I really hate that I keep chasing her thinking of the \"what if\" factor. I have the feeling of never wanting to fall in love again. It feels so, painful falling in love. Like it makes me so bitter and upset. I feel so tired of it. The high and then low of not even caring about me even though it's obvious I am a good choice. Maybe not the best, maybe not the, you know, the smartest one on the block like she is with her important job. I truly feel like I am in love with this girl and it is starting to feel much more painful than happiness. I can move on for sure, but moving on is just me looking away from others. More looking through them than at them. Sure I am young, I get it, but with how much love has been nothing but a shit fuck for me, I feel like I should get back to chasing my dreams than chasing her or anyone ever again.\n\n Anyone have any similar experiences? I would love to read your entire story about it and see how you guys/girls feel."

Immediately and I mean immediately, the image of the feet of the crucified Christ came to mind and wouldn't leave.\n\nI got the guy a hot chocolate and and egg sandwich and asked him his shoe size, which was a little smaller than the boats I wear.  I went home, collected up a warm pair of boots and a few pairs of good socks, went back and handed them to me. I could tell he struggled with his own demons when he shook my hand but whatever. There but for the grace of God go I, right?\n\nI'm not saying this because I want you to know what a great shining example of a great Catholic I am, because I'm a shitty one and I'm not saying it because I want to virtue signal because frankly, I'm ashamed and embarrassed by trying to avoid the guy because it was easier that way.\n\nI'm writing this as a reminder that Jesus meets us constantly through the least of our brothers and how we act towards them is how we act toward Him. I got lucky this morning because Jesus wouldn't let me just put my head down and walk past Him and He made me comfortable with my discomfort, if that makes sense. In his homily last week, Father mentioned that we're all responsible for each other's salvation and while that sounds nice, I didn't quite know what that meant until this morning. The homeless guy saved me. He was a conduit of grace for me, he made me see what we should be doing as Christians. I mentioned before that I'm a crummy Catholic, but maybe, just maybe, I got a little better today.\n\nEnough rambling - thanks for listening."

To make it short, your heart only aches when you're bored, LOL!\n\nI'm good in keeping things to myself just because I don't want to burden other people of whatever it is I'm going through right now, also last thing I want is pity, I'm pretty sure that I will start receiving countless texts asking how I am, wanting to take me out so I can forget, pimping me to every available guy they can think of, that's just not my style, I don't cope that way. \n\nSo I'm typing this note to you Universe because I am bored, meaning...I am in pain.\n\nTo make the long story short, that 4 relationship is now gone. It's a two-way street I must admit, we've just grown apart. The love is still there but it became stagnant, it became a \"comfortable\" kind of relationship, I realize just recently on that it's one of the deadliest kind out there.  Why? (and I am not generalizing) when you're comfortable, you don't grow in the relationship, you don't go out of your way to learn and at least appreciate what they do (the guy I was with loves Pokemon, who knew there's a million of them already). He wanted sex ALL THE TIME, I didn't give it, just because I didn't feel like it, all along I thought that he would understand.  I was soooo wrong there.  I guess the benefit of this comfortable kind of relationship is that the breakup wasn't as bad, we were still laughing and making jokes until his last day of living in my place. I tried to save the relationship but it was too late, I lost the battle before it even started.  \n\nI hope I am making sense, maybe not but I need to let you know, Universe. \n\nThis is a different kind of love story, I knew I was the antagonist, he had some misses but I know in my heart I pushed him away.  What a sad realization.  \n\nSo, I hope you learn something from this. I know that not all of you will understand, I don't intend to change your mind, all I want to say is that take the time to know your partner, go out of your way.  \n\nI am still trying to heal, it's easier than I thought but the breakup happened only last week.  Who knows? Right?"

This brief rumination is not about how faith brought me comfort in a time of trial.  It is not about the fate of the dead unborn.  It is about people.\n\nA miscarriage is an awkward affair for everyone involved.  For the parents, it\u2019s pain-filled, tragic, and in a certain sense embarrassing.  No one likes to announce that their child has died, especially after how much joy and excitement the news of the child\u2019s conception brought into the lives of friends and family.  There\u2019s no good way to do it.  For those receiving the news, the event is just as awkward.\n \nFor many people, much of the awkwardness stems from a misunderstanding of what has happened.  A miscarriage is viewed as a stepping stone on the way to a successful pregnancy.  \u201cYou\u2019ll have another one, I\u2019m sure,\u201d is meant to be comforting, but it ignores the reality of a soul that has departed.   It feels like they\u2019re comforting you after you crash your car. \u201cI know you liked it, but you\u2019ll get another car, and it will be just as good, if not better.\u201d But my son is not a car; he\u2019s human, unique and beautiful.  Nothing can replace the life that was lost.  Most people don\u2019t seem to understand that.\n \nFor a select subset of that group, the commentary is a little more insidious.  There is a denial that the child is human at all.  He\u2019s a cluster of cells that just happens to look like a tiny man with tiny fingers, tiny toes, and a tiny head. But he couldn\u2019t survive outside of the womb, so that doesn\u2019t count.  I lost a close friend of 20 years after he spouted this lie and acted accordingly. To deny my son\u2019s humanity not only insults my family, it denies reality and is madness.\n \nBut there is another group of people, one that understands the loss.  They recognize that a life has been lost and act accordingly.  They are Catholics.  The Catholic funeral director I met, our pastor, the representative from the bereavement committee all understood.  So did my parents. Although they are very lapsed Catholics, they understand the value of life.  As did the moderators of this subreddit and a few redditors I messaged privately. /u/hellenas even volunteered to drive to my apartment to make himself useful.  None of these people told us we\u2019d have another child, or subjected us to platitudes about God\u2019s plan.  They sat and suffered with us, which is what friends do (Job 2:11-13).\n \nOur faith, our beautiful faith, is the only one that truly recognizes what human life is \u2013 an icon of the Divine, the expression of unfathomable love, a testament that God is good.  Conduct yourselves in a manner fitting of an icon of God.  Honor that icon in all by defending the value of human life in all its stages. \n\nCherish your children."

She's like a drug that simultaneously fires me up and calms me down. She's intoxicating. And I can't get enough. \n\nShe's now very recently single. I have a chance now.

I believed the Church was correct with my brain...but my heart didn't feel it. \n\nI just wanted to tell someone, anyone who would understand how big of a deal it is, that I get it now. I get it. I understand why there is no other way. My heart was converted, and I fully, with every part of my soul know that we cannot exclude any soul, young, old, ill, sinner, or saint, from life...and that life includes hardship, and suffering, as well as beauty and joy. \n\nAnd the thing is, I remember where pro-choice people are coming from, I remember vividly that all-consuming fear, that to me is the opposite of faith. And I have to say, if I didn't believe in God, I don't think I could ever be pro-life. But I do have God, and this experience has shown me how incredibly powerful just being willing to learn can be. \n\nThis the first time I am saying this in my life to anyone, and I'm a little scared, but I'm also really proud. I am pro-life. And I thank our Church, and all of you who have helped me get here. In my darkest times, I have thought that if I was in the worst way, that there are people who would fight for my life NO MATTER WHAT-- faithful Catholics. I am relieved to be home, and to have been given this grace. Thank you for letting me share. \n\nEdit: typo"

I\u2019m not talking about that feeling in your gut when\n you think about what you miss. That little sigh, you wish they were \nhere. No. I\u2019m talking about physical pain. Missing someone so badly \nthat your stomach aches, and your legs cramp up, and you feel so \nfrustrated that you could hit someone, and your head splits when you\n think about them and how far away they are from you. I\u2019m talking \nabout missing someone so much that one thought or memory of them\n can cause you to smile, weep, and vomit, all at the same time. I\u2019m \ntalking about when you miss them so much that you want to keep \nthinking of them, because you want to keep crying, because you\u2019re\n afraid that if they\u2019re gone too long you might forget, so you keep \nthinking of them so you miss them more. Because missing them makes\n you think of them. You\u2019re so afraid that you may lose what you\u2019re \nfeeling. You know that the feelings you have are so true, so strong, so\n real, that they could burn through you like a fire; killing everything \nthat\u2019s left of you. Leaving a shell of who you used to be, before them.\n You know that it\u2019s dangerous to miss them this much. It could hurt \nyou, it could hurt them. And that\u2019s the last thing you ever want to do,\n because hurting them would surely be the worst thing you can \npossibly imagine. But despite your fears, and the knowledge that the\n feelings you have could ruin you, you keep hold of them desperately.\n Clinging to them. \n\t\nYou do this for one reason.\n\t\nBecause these feelings are all you have left of the person you miss. They\u2019re gone, for whatever reason, for a long time, or possibly \nforever. It doesn\u2019t matter which. But you miss everything about them,\n and you want to keep missing them. You want to keep hurting \nbecause it makes you remember them. \n\t\nAnd you do this because you know the moment you stop having\n these feelings; the moment you don\u2019t think of them the moment you \nwake up, and before you go to sleep, and every time in between. The\nmoment that happens, you might forget them. You know if you stop \nhurting you might forget them. They might fade into your memory.\nThey could become just another person you used to know. Another\n blurry memory without definition. Their importance could fade into the\n background. You\u2019re so afraid that you might forget the way they \nlooked, and felt. You always have pictures, but pictures were never\n enough for me, at least. You still forget the way they felt when they\n smiled, the way their eyes lit up like stars when they laughed. The \nway their lips formed a smile, and the way their teeth looked when \nthey grinned. You\u2019ll forge the way they sounded. The way their laugh\n tasted, and the way it bubbled inside of you and made you so warm \nand so happy that you thought nothing could ever stop you from \nsmiling. The way their hands felt in yours. The way their body felt\n against yours; the way it was so warm, so inviting. The way you felt\n like nothing could touch you as long as you were in their arms. You \nmight forget how their body moved when they walked or dance, or ran, \nor sat. How their mouth formed each syllable they spoke. The way \ntheir lips felt against yours. The stupid quirks that they had that \nsomehow drove you crazy, but made you smile bigger than you ever \nthought possible. \n\t\nWhat if you forgot it? What if you forgot all of it? What if one \nday you woke up and you couldn\u2019t remember the way they made you \nfeel? What could you do? They were gone, and you would have to \nmove on. \n\t\nBut moving on is the last thing on your mind. \n\t\nBecause you love them. \n\t\nThere has never been a truer feeling in your heart and soul than \nthe feeling you have for this person. They literally mean the world to \nyou. You can\u2019t imagine life without them. And you can\u2019t remember life \nbefore them. When you met them you knew that they were a knew \nperson, but at the same time it was as if you had known them your \nentire life. You feel so utterly comfortable around them that you would \ntell them your deepest secrets, and your most private thoughts if they \nso desired to hear them. You could tell them and not have a second \nthought; because despite the fact that you just met them, you \ntrusted them wholeheartedly. Traits that they possess that you would \ndespise in another person are bearable, or even charming in them. You \nsee the world in a whole new way because of them. The moment they \nstepped into your life the meaning of it changed. A new course was \nset for you that fateful moment, and you\u2019ll never give it up. \n\t\nYou love them. So you miss them. And you hurt for them. You \nwould probably die for them. So this pain of longing isn\u2019t so bad after \nall. Considering what you would do for them, if only they asked it of \nyou. You let the pain take you over once in a while. You give into the \ntears and the pain. You cry for hours even, just at a thought of them. \nBut it\u2019s worth every second of hurt. Because for all the pain you \nendure for them, they\u2019re worth it to you. The feeling that you get \nwhen you\u2019re with them, even if it\u2019s going to be years until that moment \nagain, you wouldn\u2019t give up for anything. Not for an instant. Because \nyou know if you let yourself stop missing them you\u2019ll forget. And \nforgetting them means forgetting the way they make you feel. It \nmeans forgetting love. And love is never something to give up on. \n\t\nMissing them means you remember them. And remembering them \nis all you have left. \n\t\nIt may seem silly to cling to a feeling that hurts so much. After \nall, if you forgot and moved on wouldn\u2019t you be happier? But then \ncomes the fear. If you forget all that they were and all they made you \nfeel how would you find it again?  You may meet someone who makes \nyou happy, not as purely happy as the other, but happy. And you may \ncompromise. What if you forget and take something less than you had? \nAnd then what if the one you had comes back, and causes you to \nremember. How could one endure? How could you leave the one you \nhad settled for, how could you hurt them like that? But how could you \ngo on after remembering what it was like with the one you really fell \nfor?"

My head and heart may burst otherwise.\n\nOne of the joys (thick sarcasm here) of being an intern is getting to cover the hospital at night. This means taking care of anywhere from fifty to seventy patients during the hours when the patients\u2019 primary teams are home living their lives outside the hospital.  This also means I don\u2019t know the patients that well, other than what I\u2019m told by the resident who signs them out.  Needless to say, it\u2019s fucking terrifying, and probably not all that safe. But it\u2019s a ubiquitous practice in healthcare, and necessary.  And to be fair, my job is not to cure anybody. It\u2019s mostly writing orders for sleep and pain medication, following-up blood tests, and knowing who to call for help when you see that a patient is getting really sick.\n\nI got a call early in the evening from a nurse who was worried about her patient\u2019s IV line. She thought it looked a little funky, and wanted my opinion about whether or not it was infected. In patients with leukemia, a type of blood cancer, even the tiniest infections can quickly become life threatening. So I went to go see the patient.  \n\nWhen I walked into the room, there was this sweet old lady sipping her apple juice and eating the last of her graham crackers. She didn\u2019t have much of an appetite, thanks to her fungal pneumonia, and thanks to the experimental chemotherapeutic drug she had just started.  Unfortunately, her disease hadn\u2019t responded to conventional chemotherapy \u2013 so this drug was a last ditch effort. \n\nBy this point, the leukemia had fucked enough with her red blood cells that she needed daily transfusions in order to keep from becoming profoundly anemic. It had fucked with her healthy white blood cells enough, that there were none left to fight infections (hence, the fungal pneumonia). It had completely fucked with her platelets, the cells needed to help kick-start blood clots. Normal platelet levels are between 150,000 and 400,000 per cubic millimeter. This lady had 2,000 \u2013 well below the level needed to prevent spontaneous bleeding. And daily platelet transfusions had done nothing to bring her numbers up.\n\nAll things considered, she looked great. Her IV line looked good too. It was just a little irritated from when it was replaced earlier in the day. We chewed the fat for a few minutes, chatting about which state produces the best apples, and whether apple juice or apple cider is better. I said goodbye, and wished her a good night.\n\nFifteen minutes later, I got a call from the same nurse that our lady was unresponsive. I had the nurse call a rapid response \u2013 which in our hospital buys you a timely ICU consult \u2013 and went to see her.  She was now slumped over in bed, empty apple juice still in hand, unresponsive to voice, unresponsive to a really hard knuckle rub on the sternum. Her heart was still beating well. But her breathing was more labored. And when I looked into her eyes, her right pupil was widely dilated, and wouldn\u2019t constrict in light \u2013 not a good sign. With the rapid change in her mental status, agonal breathing, blown pupil, and platelets level of 2,000 \u2013 everything was pointing toward a spontaneous brain bleed. So I called the neurologist, and ordered a CT scan of the head to get that ball rolling. \n\nIn the meantime, I confirmed that her husband was the designated health care proxy, or her surrogate decision maker, and I gave him a call at home. When he picked up, he immediately went into the classic old-man speech about \u201cdo you have any idea what time it is??\u201d \u2013 I cut him off right away, told him who I was, what was happening and that his wife may need to have a tube placed in her throat to help her breathe. We wanted to confirm that this was in line with her wishes before it became necessary. He said it was, and started on his way to the hospital.  In the interim, her breathing did become more labored, and the ICU intubated and put her on a ventilator. \n\nShe was transported to the CT scanner, ventilator in tow, and had images taken. To my horror, they showed a massive hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe, which at this point had grown enough to push healthy brain away from the midline. In just about every other area of the body, you can bleed internally, and the tissues will stretch to accommodate the growing volume of blood. This is not so in the head. The bony skull is too rigid in adults to give way to high internal pressures. So what eventually happens, is that the blood pools in brain, and pushes all of the tissue out of a hole called the foramen magnum, where the spinal cord enters the skull. Vital brain stem structures that control breathing get squished, and the patient dies. This is what was going to happen to this patient, without a doubt, within the next hour or so. No question. Nothing that any neurosurgeon, or miracle worker could do about it.  Though we knew it already, it was our job to break this awful news to her husband when he arrived, in the early hours of Valentine\u2019s Day. \n\nThe ICU fellow and I met him when he arrived at the hospital. He was a gentle old man, and had a youthful energy about him that you wouldn\u2019t expect for someone who had spent the last few years running to and from the hospital almost every day. He struck me as one of the rare people who are so comfortable just being, that it brings comfort to everyone else around them. This was good, because my guts were in a wicked twist at the thought of having this conversation. I would\u2019ve puked if it weren\u2019t for his calming aura.\n\nThe three of us sat down in a quiet conference room, and the ICU fellow walked through everything. The sudden change in his wife\u2019s condition, the brain bleed, the lack of options, the fact that she would die from it without artificial support. And at the end, a question was posed to the husband about how he would like to proceed. Keep her on the ventilator, keep her breathing, but with no hope of reversing the condition? Or take out the breathing tube, and make her comfortable in her last moments? \n\nHe looked at me and said he knew the leukemia had been winning the battle for a while. That the experimental drug was their last Hail Mary. That \u201cthose damn platelets just wouldn\u2019t budge,\u201d and that he knew the end was close. If it weren\u2019t the bleeding that killed her, it would be the infection, or something else unpleasant. He didn\u2019t want her to die with tubes in her throat, or to endure violent, futile chest compressions. He wanted the tube pulled. And he wanted \u201chis love to be comfortable.\u201d After verbalizing this, he looked me in the eye, and asked if I agreed. The lump in my throat dropped to my stomach, and exploded \u2013 but I managed to nod, and say yes. \n\nSo that\u2019s what happened. She was extubated, placed on a morphine drip for comfort, and helped to die peacefully. After she died, her husband wanted a few extra moments with her. As I turned to close the door behind me, he leaned down and kissed her forehead. It\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. I fucking lost it right there in the hallway.  \n\n"

For those who might have missed it, this is the address you can find it: http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1f2yfl/question_from_an_atheist/\n\nWhen I came to this subreddit to post the question, I expected some insightful answers but also some nasty comments.  What I got instead was insightful and patient answers to my questions as well as an outpouring of a highly intelligent, well thought-out theological discussion/debate amongst Catholics whom I was surprised to find out did not share a monolithic view of Catholicism.  It was so much more than I had hoped.\n\nFurthermore, there wasn't a single person who made me feel unwelcome here whatsoever.  Considering the fact that I come from a philosophical school of thought that is diagonally opposed to the Catholic Church (or most other mainstream religions), it speaks volumes toward your charity.\n\nI didn't start out as an atheist.  I was baptized as a Presbyterian.  During my time as a Presbyterian, I heard little to nothing about the Catholic Church.  I only knew that it was the institution that other Christian denominations had broken away from.  When I later on became an atheist, I got to hear much about the Catholic Church - from the likes of Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, and of course, the news in regards to the legal and moral scandals that the Catholic Church has been and is still mired in.  Although I am philosophically inclined to agree with Dawkins and Hitchens rather than not, at least in regards to skepticism toward religion, it would appear that both men, along with other influential atheists, have committed the crime of failing to be civil.\n\nWhat I have come to learn from this subreddit, besides the answers to my questions, is that it is far better to engage in polite discussions with people whom I disagree with rather than be a part of a like-minded mob because in the end, like-minded or not, a mob is still a mob and mobs are almost always an ugly lot.\n\nI think the reason why people join like-minded mobs, however, is because, and I could be wrong, rightly or wrongly, people fall into a victimhood mentality - the thought that we are surrounded by enemies and that we feel the need to lash out lest we are forced out of existence.  As an individual, I doubt that my experiences here will bring about a tectonic shift in the way theists and atheists discuss with one another, much less dispel people's sense of victimhood.  However, it has reminded me of the importance of civility and the need to understand rather than hate.  Perhaps this modest start is as good as any.\n\nThank you, /r/Catholicism.  Though I don't think that my faith in God will be restored any time soon, you have helped to restore my faith in humanity just a bit more."

She had such a zest for life, it seemed unparalleled.   We used to dream of traveling the world together.  I wanted tropical beaches, and she wanted Europe.  Barcelona, London, England, Venice,  Lisbon, Rome,  etc.  She wanted to see it all, and every magical wonder therein.  \n\nShe loved playing her guitar, horseback riding, painting, swimming, and much more.  We could go to the park, and spend hours admiring the trees, squirrels, architecture, and just the innocence of children laughing and playing.  She loved everyone,  and her kindness and compassion towards others rippled title waves through the world.  We talked for hours about endless topics.\n\nGrowing up, she traveled around the country as her mom never stood still for long, and passed that trait right on to her.  I remember a story she once told me where she swam in a creek, and ate watermelon right afterwards.  So simple, and yet one of her fondest memories.  \n\nI've seen her skin, and touched her naked body.  I felt her heartbeat with mine, and the soft caress of her quickening breathing.  I knew her both physically and spiritually to a depth untraveled by most.  I relished every word of her book, and was extremely fortunate to adorn a few chapters myself.  Her family was tight knit as they were all they ever had, and by some miracle, they accepted me.  \n\nWe did travel.  Forests, meadows, open fields, waterfalls, mountains and more.  Never across the globe though.  I wouldn't trade those memories for anything.  \n\nWith tears in my eyes as I write this,  I can affirm that I loved her more passionately than you can possibly imagine, and her me.  \n\nOh yes, and if you're wondering what makes her cry.  Among many things I could mention, I have no doubt that on a night like this,  she could be sharing the same story with tears in her eyes.\n"

Well, after years of feeling that way and pretty much avoiding women due to the pain I felt from my first love (long story short, she was 18, I was 14 and she was banging some other guy while \"dating\" me). I spent a lot of time creating dating rules, what is and wasn't allowed with me, and keeping myself distant from any woman I dated. I went so far as to date one of my longtime crushes and keep so distant that when she broke up with me after 3 years I told her good riddance so she would feel anger and not the pain I felt as I walked away. That was before I met, the one. \n\nNow, let me explain how this changed my viewpoint on the most wonderful word in the world...Love. I am a man, I follow through on commitments and I keep my word. When I started dating my girlfriend, it started just like all the rest of my relationships and marriage was the right thing to do. When I said, \"I do,\" I told her. There's no getting rid of me, I will always be there, no matter what and you better think about that before you agree. She agreed, and we went through some REALLY tough times.\n\nMy (now) wife has kept her word, too. Right now I suffer from a horrific disease that makes me feel less than half the man I was before. I do wish for death, but every time I look in her eyes, I stand tall. There's no special mix that we drank, nor any special steps we took. We just WORKED at it, all the time, and when we stopped for a little bit we became a little toxic, but we cleaned that up and opened up to each other even more. This all took work. I can look back now, over the 15 years we've been together and I can see the hard times, even now, but I also see my first born son in my arms and me crying like a baby knowing this tough old bastard wouldn't be able to keep him safe his entire life. Then revisiting the same with my second child, and third. All four of them are my world and if you think love is a four letter word, then you've probably lumped work in that same boat. There's a reason love comes before work in the dictionary, because it is easier to love than to work and you generally want love MORE than work. \n\nI submit to those in this subreddit that love is to work and keep in focus a goal of team work and unity. I have learned since those \"horrible\" high school years and knocking my pride down (a bit) that heartbreak does hurt and it does seem horrible, but for every tear I shed over a woman who \"destroyed\" me, I've shed another tear of joy while this woman stood by me. I would take all the pain a thousand times over just knowing how wonderful it is to have a love who is as dedicated and hard working as I am. \n\nI hope to share this with those of you who are out there and wonder if it really does get any better, and it does. For those who hurt and wonder about that pain of being alone, it goes away. Always remember who you are and keep true to that, \"I do\" or never say it in the first place. You won't know which person is right, I sure didn't. 15 years later, I know she is perfect for me. All because of one failed blind date my entire life has a light that blinds. \n\nThank you for reading.\n\n(tl;dr Lasting love takes work)"

I fell into the wrong group of kids, trying to cope with the extreme amount of stress and depression I was dealing with. I went from a sweet kid who wanted to become everyone's friend to a hoodlum, smoking, listening to metal, atheist, and hated the world, until she came along.\n\nThere was something about her, she made me happy, one of the only times I could ever be happy during those times. She would make me laugh and smile, and she started bringing the old me back out. It was wonderful, I loved her, but i was too nervous to ask her out. Soon she was taken from me, I had waited too long, someone else had asked her out and she hardly ever saw me again.\n\nI had dropped harder than ever before, my heart broken, depression kicking in, I didn't want to live anymore. Nothing was ever going right, things only got worse, and I didn't want to live in it anymore. I was walking along a bridge, and thought about jumping off, when I received a text message, it was from her, the first time I had talked to her in a half a year, and she had said that she missed me, and that she had broken up with her boyfriend. Receiving that text made me change my mind, I walked away from the bridge, and continued to talk to her for the rest of the night.\n\nAt the end of the night, we were talking about movies, the new toy story, and how it's ending around the same time we are graduating/ getting close to graduating. She said that every good movie has to end, and she was watching one right then, she said that it was about a young girl texting this amazing, sweet boy, but was getting so tired she couldnt focus any more.\n\nThis event made me man up and finally ask her out, I am a computer person, and she speaks a little French (now is minoring in French in college) so I decide to make a program that would tell of a story, and at the end of the story, it would open a file hidden on the jump drive containing the story of a teddy beat holding a heart, and in French, it said \"Kira, will you go out with me?\" i had given it to her on a Friday, and was nervously awaiting a reply, on Sunday, I finally got a reply saying that she would love to go out with me, making me the happiest guy in the world.\n\nWe went to the movies, and went to dinner afterward, she has diabetes, and she is allergic to wheat, so her choices for food are extremely limited, but that was no worry to me, I would learn to deal with anything for her. It was the best night of my life, going on a date with the girl I've loves for a year and a half now, nothing could get better.\n\nIt wasn't a week later that I decided to ask her if we could be Facebook official, when she told me the bad news... She said that she thought we were going out as just friends. It crushed me, I didn't know what to do or say, I had payed for the entire night out, but it was worth it at the end of the night because I loved her, and I would have done anything for her, and she thought it was just as friends... I was not myself since that point.\n\nA year and a half later, I still love her, she's still the girl that saved me from dying, and saved me from being a highschool drop out, smoking and drinking and partying. I graduated highschool, and planned on moving to Oregon for college a week later. \n\nAt my going away party, she came, and bringing a chocolate rose for me. The night progressed, eventually her and I ended up kissing, the best thing that has ever happened in my life. She had flashed me that same night, but the kiss was the most important event, nothing else mattered but that. I wanted her to come with me, but she had college there, and her family, so we went our separate ways.\n\nMoving to Oregon was achieved through the use of cars, and many nights of staying in hotels, one night in the hotel, I decided to check Facebook when I see it, the worst thing that I had ever seen, it said \"Kira is in a relationship to John Doe (not actual name)\" my heart stopped beating, I couldn't breath, I couldn't think, I couldn't do anything. I was a statue, frozen in time and space. Not 3 days since I left, and she is in a relationship with some guy, I talk to her about him, and she tells me about how he's sweet, and really shy, and how it took a lot for him to ask her out, it sounded like he had the exact same personality as me. The girl i love, taken by a guy who is exactly like me. My heart shattered into a million pieces.\n\nAfter reaching Oregon, I placed the chocolate rose she gave me on my desk, in the hand of a dragon statue, I see it every day when I sit at my computer, and I think of her, and how much I love her, she means everything to me, and even though she is with another guy, she's happy, and that's all that matters to me.\n\nIf that isn't love, than I don't know what is, thank you for taking your time to read the story of my crappy, but true love story, not every love story ends happily, but no one knows what happens in the future, and maybe something good would finally happen in my life :)"

She was a friend of my room mate and she lived on the same floor as my in the dorm. We ended up getting to know each other more and more over the first couple of months of school and by winter time we had gotten extremely close. At the time I met her she was in a relationship with this dude for close to 3 years. He was nearly five years older than her and she would constantly talk to me about how she didn't love him anymore and was looking for a way out of the relationship. I had hung out with the two of them multiple times and though I have nothing against him, I knew that they weren't right for each other. I was also in a relationship with a HUGE bitch. She tried to control every aspect of my life and in general made me completely miserable. She is now my ex girlfriend and have not talked to her since. (But that's another story in and of its own). Anyway, at this point I've known her for about six months and I had fallen so deeply in love with her that she was the only thing I could ever think about. We would spend a lot of alone time together just talking. It was insane how much we shared in common. It was like our minds were one. Our philosophy on life was just so similar. I am a very laid back person and don't stress about much and she was the exact same way. We would always finish each other's sentences. Even when we would sit in silence, I never felt uncomfortable or awkward, we both knew that we were just having our own thoughts. And if one of us had a thought that we wanted to share, we didn't have a problem speaking our minds. This made every conversation we had a meaningful one because we would never just \"shoot the shit\". Although my feelings for her were so intense, I wouldn't dare reveal my secret to her. Her friendship was too valuable to me to put at risk and also we had decided that me her, and another friend of mine were going to share an apartment next year together, so I figured that my shot with her was at this point at a zero percent. She was everything and more that I was looking for in a girl; great sense of humor, laid back, insanely smart, down to earth, humble, adventerous and not to mention drop dead gorgeous. I distracted myself with other girls for a few months until finally towards the end of the school year she ended things with her boyfriend. Even at this point, I didn't make a move because I didn't want to mess anything up friendship wise/ living arrangements. Summer finally came and I went on a family vacation for the first two weeks of the break. While I was gone, she was the only thing I could think about. I couldn't wait to get back home just so I could see her.\n\nSkip forward 2 weeks. The first night I get home and I hang out with her and a couple mutual friends. She gave me the biggest hug I have ever received the moment I saw her again. She told me multiple times how much she missed me while I was gone. You could't imagine how amazing that felt to hear. The next day we hang out again with the other friend we are going to be sharing an apartment with and find a place to live for the next coming school year in the city. The rest of the day we spent together just the two of us driving around and exploring nearby forest preserves. This day everything just seemed to be clicking. We had the best conversations that day and learned even more about each other. The more I learned about her the more I realized this was the girl that I not only wanted in my life, but NEEDED in my life. I had a mix CD in my car at the time with the song \"The Only Living Boy in New York\" on it by Simon and Garfunkel. As soon as it came on she exclaimed how it was her favorite song. Mine too but I also said that it has my favorite lyric of all time in it. \"I've got nothin' to do today but smile.\" She freaked out and said that it was her favorite lyric too. I was getting goosebumps at all the things that were happening that day. It was like we were reading each others thoughts. We made it back to her place and watched the movie Garden State. A favorite of hers and mine. We ended up snuggling on the couch and before I knew it I was kissing the her and she was kissing me back. It was the most magical moment of my entire life.\n\n\nThat was three months ago. We've been dating ever since and now live together as well. Since then she told me that she had started to like me around the same time I had started to like her and that I was part of the reason she decided to end it with her now ex-boyfriend. Damn that felt good to hear. \n\nNot two weeks after we started dating, I told her that I was in love with her. She felt the same. \n\nThis girl makes me feel alive. She makes me feel like life is worth living and every day I get to wake up next to the my favorite person in the world. \n\nEveryone, Love is real. Don't stop searching because trust me it is real and when you find it, you hold on to it with everything you have. If the person you are dating makes you miserable, I promise you, you don't love them. When you find the person your meant to be with, everyday feels like the happiest day of your life. Don't settle when you can have so much more and don't cut yourself short.\n\nBe patient with the one you love and the universe will let everything fall into place. \n\nI don't care if people up vote or down vote this. I just needed to share my story. I have found my soul's counterpart and I am truly happy. \n\nTL;DR: I have found the love of my life and have never been happier."

Maybe I'm being melodramatic, but right now in this very moment, that is what it feels to me. Just for one second, lets go back in time...\n\nThat first day, they day I met you. Everything was so perfect. Perfectly put together. I was with my friend, waiting for our crew to arrive. But you came before they did, and that's when all the pieces started joining together. I met you. That goofy little smile of yours. Since I met you I am not able to get you out of my mind. I remember my words to my friend, the first time I saw you... \"Damn that boy is perfect, I promise one day he's going to be my boyfriend.\" It literally was love at first sight. Since I saw you those where the first words that spilled out of my mouth, and I don't regret them. Till today, those words still spill out of my mouth. And then you grabbed me aside. I couldn't believe it, you wanted to be with me. We talked and talked and talked all night. You held my hand and asked me to dance. I didn't know how to dance, but I let go because I wanted to be with you. We danced and I really didn't want that night to end ever, because I was afraid this would be the last one. Remember we left the party? We were in the car and you kept hugging me and holding my hand. I was literally in the moon by this point. I could't believe how perfect you were. We arrived at your friend's house. Of course, we drank more. And then for a moment, it was just you and me. I got cold, you gave me your jacket. You were freezing. You told me we should hug to keep warm, your arms were wrapped on my waist under the jacket. You held me, oh so tightly. Hugging me. I didn't ever want to let go. I loved your dimple, I made you smile just so I could see it. We talked almost in whispers. You tried to kiss me and I looked away. Not now I thought. He's different, he was someone to take seriously. I want something real with him. And then it was time to go. You walked me out, and your friend made me stay with your jacket. \"What a good wing man,\" I thought. He knew you liked me, this was a way to reassure we'd see each other again. You told met to let you know when I arrived home. I did. We talked somewhat, and then I fell asleep, with a smile on my face and your cologne infused jacket on. One of the best nights of my life. That night I fell asleep not wanting to, I didn't want that night to end, live that moment forever. I didn't want to forget a single bit. I knew that night, I fell in love with you. I knew I'd see you again. I was afraid this would be our only night. I just knew you were different. You were the one. I was so happy. The first time I fell asleep so happy in so long, so much I didn't even want to sleep, I wanted to replay every moment. And I woke up the next day with a message from you. God, I was in love with you already. "

Because of this I wrote in a notebook about instead keeping it inside of me.  I chased around a girl that I thought I had a crush on. I realised after so long that she wasn't right for me. Although she was funny, smart and attractive, i knew she wouldn't like me, although I share the same traits. In the last two months of the school year my old friends started being assholes and still are. They made insults about how I looked and acted, and called it banter without realising that they were taking it too far. So I hung out with some other friends I never really got to know. In doing this, it made me realise I made some terrible friends and bad enemies when I was younger. My mum said when I was in primary school girls had crushes on me but I never had a clue. Now I am exploring love I finally see the potential I have. These new friends were also friends of girls in my tutor group, the girl I talked about at first was in my tutor. So one of them, called Maia, was girlfriend to a boy named Thomas but they broke up after a while. They obviously weren't meant to be together either, but they remained friends. Now, this is where my story with her started. Because I was no longer depressed and no longer in love, I felt empty. So Maia must've seen this, and once she hung out with me after she broke up she took a shine to me. She is the first girl who will actually come over just to talk to me... this is the most amazing feeling. I figured out I love her, and i think she thinks that too. We laugh at each others jokes, we're the same intelligence... I feel comfortable around her. I never got a chance to go out with her, because we finished for summer holidays. I am going into year 9 next year. I have her Snapchat and her phone number and talk to her loads on those. \nI suppose all I want to say is \"I love you.\""

This is my first time posting on this subreddit, and this may be a little bit lengthy... But hopefully this is worth your read!\n\nAnyway, I want to talk to you guys about my spiritual journey of how I went from being an agnostic atheist to being in the process of converting (or reconverting...?) to Catholicism. So to start this post off, my family isn't particularly religious. My mom is a Mexican Catholic and my dad is a Muslim but they both don't practice their religions (it's more of a cultural aspect to them). My parents split before I was born so I was raised mainly by my mother. My mother is a very lapsed Catholic. Never seen her pray or even go to church while growing up. We would only go to church on Christmas but even that stopped around my middle school years. She got me baptized when I was a toddler, but that's as far as it went. I didn't receive my first holy communion or confirmation. Growing up, we never talked about religion in the house, so I grew up in a secular environment. By age 14 I considered myself an Agnostic, and by 16 I was a hardcore Atheist.\n\nI became an Atheist originally by the fact that there are so many evil actions in the world and that meant (to me) that there must of not been any sort of higher power. My Atheism started by emotional tactics rather than by logic. But as the years went by, I started using logical facts to support and strengthen my stance on Atheism. I could not comprehend how anyone could believe that a higher power could even exist- it was a foreign concept to me. I believed that just because we don't know what caused the universe to exist that it didn't mean we should just say it was God to fill in the gap. I believed that religion was just a primitive way for our ancestors to explain the universe. You get the point. I would say I was pretty militant about my Atheism during my High School years. That calmed down during the first two years of college however as I just became more apathetic to religious topics and focused more on politics cause of the election (story for another time...). During the time I was more apathetic with my beliefs (when I was 19-20, which was 2016-2017), I made the move to Agnosticism as I started to realize that there wasn't any sort of evidence to support Atheism either. Sure Atheism claims to use 'logic' and facts to support its frontline, but the logic used to support Atheism doesn't necessarily lead to...well, Atheism. I also became more open minded with the fact that we humans will never know for sure whether or not there is some sort of higher power behind the creation of the universe. No matter the logic or the facts you use, it will never necessarily lead to the existence or nonexistence of a \"higher power\". You can only depend on your experiences and emotions to verify your own beliefs, and this goes towards every belief system- including Atheism, as much as they love to preach that they use logical facts and science.\n\nNow, around Summer of 2017, I was starting my Junior year in University. I started researching more about religion, as religion became an interesting topic for me to research more about. I looked up online the beliefs of Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, etc. I just had a fascination with religion, and I wanted to dig deeper into how people could believe in a God, as it was still a pretty hard concept for me to grasp at the time. I did more research and came to the conclusion that since there is complexity, rules, and structure to the universe and how it operates then there must be some sort of intelligence behind all this (NOTE: I don't say this is logical or factual 'evidence', but more of an argument to support my reasoning). The concept of a higher power became less foreign to me. I started becoming an Agnostic Deist at this point.\n\nOut of all the religions, Christianity interested me the most. I researched the history of Christianity and more about its belief system. The more I researched the history of Christianity, the less crazy it became to me. In Christianity, it says that hundreds of people saw the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and that these people's testimonies of Jesus is in the bible (of course). Jesus' existence was even supported by non-christian historians and politicians of the time such as Tacitus or Jewish priest Josephus. It's clear Jesus did exist, the question, however, was whether or not he was the Son of God. This is where faith comes in. Seeing how hundreds of people saw him resurrect from the dead and seeing how fast Christianity expanded in it's early years without the use of war. Considering how people were willing to be Christians and follow Jesus and his teachings in a time where being Christian was highly a taboo and could have gotten one killed. This alone got me thinking more. If Jesus wasn't who he said he was, then why were these people so adamant about him even if their beliefs could have gotten them killed? they remained loyal to him. This is where I took a leap of faith and saw the possibility that Jesus could have been the Son of God.\n\nNow, since the start of the year, I've gone to the Catholic center at my university and taken their RCIA classes to learn more about Christianity. Why did I choose Catholicism out of all the denominations? well simply because I like their theology (as a philosophy minor!) and because they are the first branch of Christianity. If I'm going to become Christian, might as well be in the branch that helped start the religion. Maybe I'm also being a little bias because that's my ancestral religion as well and the one I got baptized in. Anyway, when I slowly started accepting Jesus Christ, I noticed a couple of my prayers beings answered. Maybe they could have been coincidences but the timing of these coincidences are just so... convenient. I'm not going to dwell about theses experiences as my post is already too long and my experiences are just too personal for me (PM me if you want to know about them though). Learning more about Catholicism in RCIA and having a new found relationship with God has lead me to decide that I want to receive my holy communion and get confirmed. Religion has brought happiness in my life. Even these past few months, I can see how much I've developed by becoming less judgmental and more helpful towards others. I\u2019ve also become less promiscuous. My friends aren't religious at all, and since I'm a gay male they always ask me why I would even consider converting to Catholicism in the first place. However, my spiritual journey is mine and mine alone. I still have some doubts (who doesn't?), but my faith strengthens the more I learn about it and by my own personal spiritual experiences that I could not even explain away by using logic.\n\nI hope this read was interesting to you guys, and feel free to ask questions! I just wanted to write about my own spiritual journey as I don't really have anyone to talk about it in real life lol. Again, sorry for the lengthy post!"

            "value": "Ever feel love so deep that there aren't words to name it? I think to myself how much I love this man. He completely enchants me in the most un-describable ways. Thing is, we aren't even a couple. We aren't \"together\". It's so much deeper, I can't describe it with little words. Society pressures people into naming every little thing, and into thinking that you have to put a title on everything.  Why can't two people simply love each other? Why do we have to have pressure of sharing our love to others, making it official with documents, naming it, etc. This guy and I are just two people who have deeply connected and bonded. If giving titles is necessary then I'd call us best-friends & partners...I suppose. \n\n\n  \nOur relationship is so weird. I can't get over how strange it is. How un-defined it is. I'm trying to get over thinking about that and just live in this moment and stop worrying about the future. I just want to live these moments with him. He's very different, and I love that. I love his imperfection. One time he drove me up to this viewing deck late at night where you can see hundreds of miles of mountains south and all the stars in the sky. It was just us there alone in the cold and silence. We sat down on a bench and started to look into each others eyes and I felt the warmest, safest, realest feeling I've ever felt before.  It wasn't even the \"butterflies in my stomach\" type of lovey feeling. It wasn't sexual or even romantic. Just deep love, deep connection. It felt as if I had known him all my life, and as if we had experienced all of life's challenges together leading up to that one final moment. It was the most magical and strange moment in my life, I've never told anyone about it until now because it was so special to me. We just sat there, holding hands in silence for at least 20 minutes. \n\n\n\nIn most relationships you look at your girlfriend/boyfriend and feel romantic love towards them, but with us there isn't really that. Our relationship is pretty private, only my closest friends know. He's been through a shit-storm of terrifying events in his life, so I help him cope emotionally, and I think that certainly made us bond very close, and very fast. \n\n\n\nGod it's just so weird this feeling I have. I thought that trying to write it out would help me describe it, but I don't think I'm doing too good of a job at truly depicting it. The point is that in my opinion, love shouldn't have a definition. It's so complex and I think it comes in so many different forms. Society's pressure to be this \"cookie cutter\" couple is bull-shit -- 1) Not a single person has a perfect relationship and 2) There are billions of different ways to experience love. I have no clue how to name or describe what me and this guy are. All I know is my love and connection with him is something I can't imagine my life without. I try not to think about that though. I try not to think about the future, the definitions or anything. I just feel these emotions day by day, and enjoy time I have with this enchanting, complex master piece of a person..."

Wow.\nI've been \"in love\" countless times. I'm a new person every time I fall in love with someone. We all shift to a personality that we feel suits us per relationship. We grow our world views based on our partners' views. Maybe things we had previously had closed-view opinions on start to seem trivial.\nI've been the needy, clingy, smothering partner before.\nAnd I've now been on the other side.\nAfter countless relationships, I have found the one that balances me in every way.\nI've had such varied experiences that I can finally appreciate a pure, healthy and beneficial relationship.\n\nThere is something to be said when you reach the other side of breakups.

It had come to the point where it was too painful to be with him anymore, I loved him more than he wanted to loved I think, or maybe he just didn't love me back anymore. I am sure he thinks this was done because someone else is paying more attention to me, but that's not it at all. I am all alone and right now its awful and its okay at the same time. I have learned quickly how to be alright by myself, I have had to. And by alone I mean I have no one at all. I don't feel like I have come out of this well, I feel like I'm defective, and all of me is not quite enough for anyone because it wasn't enough for you-ever. I feel ugly and stupid and afraid, and it is all so much to handle right now. I miss you and wonder every day if youre okay, if you are still killing yourself drinking and not taking care of your health, I wonder if you will be okay on your own and I wonder if you miss me at all. So many nights I have been dialing your number and realize I cant call you, I cant see if youre okay, or how your day was, or tell you im scared all the time, or tell you my big plans, you would be so proud of me working so hard. I wish you would have just held out a little longer you would have seen how much I changed for you, I changed everything for you, I tried so hard to be compliant about your drinking and you going out all the time without me, about me being put last for so long. It really hurts my heart, I had such a bad panic attack the other day I went to the hospital because I thought I was having a heart attack. I know you will move on, you already were when we were still together, I just want to tell you how much I love you, still, every single day. It's sad that it had to end like this, I wanted to be your wife and have your babies, I would day dream about it all the time, how it would happen I was so sure it would end that way. I'm sorry I was so depressed for so long, I really am. I'm sorry I cried too much and that I was so afraid all of the time that I was like a cornered dog lashing out sometimes, I'm sorry I hurt you like I was hurting, I'm sorry that I wanted to kill myself and made you worry. I know that it wore on you, but sometimes I wish you had been a little kinder, I wish you had been there more. I'm so happy you were in my life because you taught me a lot of lessons, lessons that were really hard to learn, like how I can't hurt others even if they have hurt me, it doesn't help at all. I learned that I cant rely on anyone to ever be there for me 100% it doesn't last, it fades away so quickly, and I learned that love is not enough to keep two people together and happy. I think us being in love was the best and worst thing that ever happened to me, because it has been the most painful thing in my life to have to not be with you. Anyway, stay calm, be kind, don't be afraid to love again, be good to your family-they need you, eat well my little piggy, and I'm sure i'll see you one day on tv or in a magazine for being a famous tattoo artist-just don't lose sight of the big picture the little things don't matter. Most importantly please remember when you are sad or disappointed in yourself or about to throw in the towel, that you are a beautifully complex person capable of much more than you think. It was why I was always so proud of you, and why I was upset when you were settling in your life, I knew you were better than to settle with anything. Maybe one day you will understand why I was the way I was, I hope I can understand why you were the way you were. I hope you tried your best because I did too. I hope you're doing well if you ever read this. "

I had a great conversation with a local priest who serves in the parish I've been attending for the past few weeks. The conversation went about as well as I could have expected. I now fully intend to become a Catholic.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no RCIA around me, so instead I will be beginning a period of individual instruction with a priest. Because I am already baptized, had thought a lot about this decision, have a background in philosophy and (to a lesser extent) theology, and was reading/researching on my own for some time before approaching a priest, my priest will be tailoring my Catholic education to fit where I am. I'm very excited, and I cannot wait to be confirmed and to take the Blessed Sacrament once I have joined the Catholic Church. I also am eager to learn more about the faith as my education progresses.\n\nAnd personally, I feel great. I have started praying the Rosary, asking the Blessed Virgin Mary to intercede for me as I go through this process. The last stumbling block for me was the Rosary, but after trying it out I have found it to be a wonderful prayer that I do not want to give up.\n\nAnd now I should say this: thank you, /r/Catholicism. A few weeks ago, I was posting here saying I was scared to even mention Catholicism to my Protestant family. You encouraged me to speak to them and to pray. I did both and it went well. Then you encouraged me to reach out to a priest. I did and it went well. This community has been a wonderful resource!"

I was looking at a post on another (non-Christian) religion's reddit sub, which was peppered with obscene celebrations and triumphalism about the death of Jesus Christ.  The joke is on them, of course, because nobody celebrates the death of our Lord more intensely than we sinners who have discovered our salvation and freedom in the narrow way of our crucified King.  But unlike those non-Christian revelers, we also mourn his death, because the blood of God's Son is on our hands, shed for every foul thought, word, or deed we've carelessly or carefully indulged.\n\nI became a Christian about a decade ago.  I was an Orthodox Jew\u2014in fact, an *ultra*-Orthodox Jew, which means that I dressed in black suits and white button-ups, never touched a woman even to shake her hand, never lifted a light-switch on Shabbat, and kept thousands of other aspects of the Jewish legal tradition called *Halacha*.  We thought of Jesus Christ largely as a shady provocateur, his death highlighting his obvious failure and his life highlighting his delusion.  We never actually spoke his name. We never said the word, \u201cJesus.\u201d  We used little, spiteful euphamisms for him instead. He was dead; we are not; and the Torah is not.  What more needs to be said?  The tomb speaks definitively.\n\nEvery year, late at night, after the Easter Vigil has long concluded, the streets of Jerusalem's Old City become crowded with Christians.  First faintly, and then loud enough to make babies cry, a brass band of Arab Christian students parades through the streets of the Christian Quarter, tracing a triumphant path from the Tomb, the Holy Sepulchre, and past the Latin Patriarchate's parish church.  The Tomb, especially an empty one, indeed speaks definitively.\n\nIt is not easy to be a Christian in the Holy Land, but it is beautiful.  It is not easy to be a Christian in secularizing Western Europe\u2014a recent poll showed that only 37 percent of young Spaniards even calls themselves Catholic, and among those, only 10 percent of them bothered attending weekly Mass.  Spain, as we all know, has long been the spiritual, intellectual, and political powerhouse of the Christian West.  Now it is a shell of its former Christian glory.  It is not easy to be an Egyptian Copt, where your weekly attendance at church risks getting you blown into bits by Islamist bombers.  It is not easy to be a Christian governor of Jakarta, now sitting in jail for campaigning on the idea that Christians can be good leaders, too.  It is not easy being a young Christian in the United States, a new convert to a faith that most young people take less seriously than John Stewart's comedy.  It's not easy to be alone like that.\n\nIt's not easy to watch the news erupt with reports about homosexual love triangles involving even high-ranking clerics and prelates of the Church.  It's not easy to watch those charged with a courageous and life-giving proclamation of the Gospel shrink from their duty when it means taking a hammer to the idols of relevance, popularity, and a perniciously false \u201cmercy\u201d that has no resemblance to the real thing that oozed from the side of our crucified Christ.  It is not easy to be a Christian struggling to live and think and see with chastity, only to be assaulted by the perpetual peep-show that our poor culture puts on. \n\nWe, too, are wounded in a tomb.  We have been ruled out as relics of a Christian past utterly unequipped to win the future.  It's not hard to feel like maybe our Jesus really was little more than a cheap provocateur of authority.

Shouts.  Cries. Victory. Could it be?\n\nThe growth of Christianity is so explosive in China that it will be the most Christian country in the world in less than 15 years.  The African Christian population today is less than 400 million.  In just seven years it is estimated that it will be around 600 million.  In 1900, the Christian population of the entire African continent was 8 million.  In the Maronite Church we call Holy Saturday \u201cSaturday of the Light.\u201d  Jesus descends to hell, preaches the Gospel, and leads buried hearts to life-everlasting.  It's not a stretch to say that we are entering a period of history of that is, truly, \u201cof the Light\u201d in the very same way, where so much of what looked lost is given new light.\n\nThe brass band gets louder and louder.  Don't let the muffled sounds discourage you. Don't let the nay-sayers and death-celebraters confuse you. This Easter, and every Easter, Jesus Christ is alive.\n\nShouldn't we be the first to tell them?\n\nHappy Feast of the Resurrection to all of you."

But what else is there a  bar even worse. \n\nBut I got back on tinder just looking for something and I started talking to this girl. Almost immediatly we exchanged numbers, and started texting. Asking each other all sorts of things and just clicking on so many levels. We texted for like 2 days straight but it felt like two months. Our date tonight went amazing. From the first second I saw her there was just something. After drinks and dinner I took her to a spot were you can see all of LA and the bay. We kissed and it's was like we were teenagers again (both 26). The intense closeness was just unreal. After I dropped her off we were talking in just disbelief at how amazing the night went. We were both saying it was only one date I can't belive the stuff I'm feeling and thinking. We decided to say what we were thinking at the same time. \"Soulmate\" we both are in utter amazement. This kind of thing happens in the movies not real life. But we have both come to all the same realizations the whole way through this. I'm jus so happy and just  amazed that I'm pretty sure my Soulmate and I just found each other and it's like 230 in the morning none of my friends are up, I had to share this with somone.

This kid shares the same background as me and It has been very difficult to find people who share my background where I live. He and I only shared one conversation exchanging the fact that we are both of the same religion and whatnot, he was really surprised that I was too and I always felt he took an interest in me before he knew. He's very religious from what he has shown and told me from that one time. Anything after that was just exchanged awkward glances, he's really shy I think.I always thought about him and the summer after I graduated non stop. I thought of him every single day, day and night. I never knew why. Today I actually thought of him and it's weird because the thought of him began to fade long ago but I do think of him when I pray every once in a while. Well anyway, today I thought of him and I was leaving my college and I look up and he's literally walking right before my eyes. I stood there and froze. I said absolutely nothing to grab his attention. He was walking in a way where he wasn't able to see me so I'm not sure if he saw me before I saw him or not. I was so amazed, I haven't seen him in a year and I thought of him today and I saw him shortly after. He doesn't go to my college because he's a year younger than me but I assume he came to register? I hope he did :) I'm praying that I'll see him again because I feel like something is there. Thank you for reading."

I was born with a cleft palate and the doctor said there's little chance I would survive. My dad was told to sign a death contract to insure that there was no accident causing this death. However, my mom refused to believe the news and took me home after two weeks I spent in the incubator. For two years, I couldn't eat because my lip was split open. My mom fed me around the clock 24 hours, seven days a week with a tube that went through my nose. My dad told my brother when he was 2 years old saying, \"Mom's busy with your brother. Take care of yourself.\" That really hit me. I always get in to fights with my brothers and complain he gets more attention, but it was me that robbed his childhood. My mom saved a dying baby out of unconditional love. She took me and named me, Luke. It means, light of the darkness.

Leaning on my shoulder, holding my hand etc. I still don't act on it. Last Friday she writes on my fb saying 'after work beers at my work?' (she's a waitress) and I think 'fine, it's a cool friendly hangout'.\n\n I get home and she looks amazing! She is very dressed up and asks me how long it will take to get ready. I shower and put on some nice clothes too and we are off. We arrive at her work and from the instant we walked in it was if she was showing me off to her workmates. Her boss looked me up and down then she whispered in my ear that the bosses like to size up the girls the guys come in with. We try and find a seat and there is a convenient litlle romantic table for two on the balcony. We sit down and she orders us a variety of snacks and heaps of beer (all on her, she insists). Her waitress friends come over and giggle and whisper to her and we all just have a good time. We organize to go to a club with some of them later on. As we drink more and time wears on, her friends started finishing work and joining us for a drink. Soon, she reaches for my hand and we have our fingers interlocked, squeezing affectionately every now and then. The girls mention making a move towards the club when I get a txt from the girl I'm out with saying 'let's just go home and watch a movie'. I txt back yes and after saying our goodbyes we walk to find a taxi. She is under my arm and as we walk she stops and swings into me and we kiss. We get in the taxi and continue. We arrive home and we snuggle up in the couch ready to watch something but we realize we are to drunk and go to her room. We end up sleeping in eachothers arms which was amazing. \n\nFast forward a few days of happiness and I get a txt saying we need to talk. Fuck. I greet her as I arrive home and we have a fun night chatting etc. Then she says she is going to bed. I mention the talk and she says 'oh yeah'. She tells me she likes me, but she is not in the right headspace for a relationship. Gutted. I end up being an emo for a few days and head out to a friends birthday party tonight. I start chatting to a girl who soon asks me if we should take the party back to mine and I say... no. It would be awkward having a girl back there with my flattie hearing all thats going on and truth be told, I'm still not over her. I'm drunk so I taxi home and watch a bit of tv. Soon I'm dozing off so I go to the bathroom before heading to bed. As I leave the bathroom I see a shadow of some fucking douche lurking. This guy side steps me and uses the bathroom. I got to my room and soon I hear my flattie getting pounded by this dude. After I turned down a girl. Fuck that and everything about it. I got dressed and went for a walk. It's almost 3.50am and I'm writing this at a bus stop. \n\nWhat the hell is going on?!?\nI need some kind of words of wisdom! \nPlease console me reddit :(\n\n"

It's not easy.  At times it's quite awkward and at times I feel disgusted towards him.  Disgusted because he never liked to be emotionally close with me or physically affectionate and when he was physically affectionate, it was always because he was trying to get me to be sexual with him.  I wonder why he even got into a \"relationship\" with me in the first place if there was no love there.  Seems easy for him to move on past the fact that we've been together for so long but we both know it's not working.  He isn't emotionally available and I can't be with a void.  Also, I do realize that this relationship has been hard lesson; a confirmation of the brokenness of gay relationships.  It's not the first one i've been in that has turned out to be this way and i'm honestly sick of people trying to defend homosexuality by saying that some relationships are just this way and it's unfortunate but, \"don't give up\".  The majority of gay men just want sex and though many do want love, they oft equate love w i t h sex, which, to me, is quite degrading and insulting.  I mean...I d o have a heart and a soul.  I'm not j u s t a body.  \n\nThis \"relationship\" has broken me.  At times i've often felt as though it's a reminder that i'm not worthy of actual love.  I'm just an object, even though I know that's not true.  \n\nI see this person i'm now just living with and I see things clearly; he watches vulgarity on tv, hates anything conservative or Christian and is vain, focused only on his looks.  I try not to judge and I try not have resentment.  I guess it's only natural that a person would tho, given the situation.  Easy for him.  He hasn't suffered a bit it seems.  \n\nI'm just here and I feel alone.  I feel more alone now than I have nearly the past 2 years because now we're actually NOT together and he doesn't seem to care.  He's ok'd me to stay til I can actually get out but let me tell you, it's emotional torture.  If staying with someone for nearly 2 years that's emotionally unavailable wasn't torture enough, it's remaining in a living situation with them and seeing them so casually move on as if they're not affected at all.\n\nI know that this relationship is broken and has always been.  I know that it's sinful.  I just needed to talk to someone and though God is my refuge, i'm reaching out to my fellow Christians for some added words of encouragement during this trying and awkward time.  My heart hurts and I just ask for your prayers if anything.  I hope you all had a wonderful Christmas.  I sat home alone, he went to be with his family.  I don't have much of a family.  I feel alone and I also feel the darkness of that feeling trying to make me believe i'm alone.  I won't.  I know better.  \n\nThat's all, for now.  <3 you guys."

This will conclude a journey for me that started almost 25 years ago. (And open up the beginning of a new one.) \n\nI grew up as a Southern Baptist; and I kind of quit Christianity for a while in college until I hit bottom for various reasons. At that time, I was invited by a Catholic friend to attend a weekend youth retreat at my university's Newman Center. During that weekend I experienced in a very personal, even visceral way the grace and love of God, and I decided to come back to the church again. But only the small \"c\" church, as becoming a Catholic never crossed my mind. IIRC that was in 1990 when I was a junior in college. \n\nI'll spare you all my life story here, but the TLDR is that I attended a lot of Protestant churches and learned much about God and about Jesus Christ in those churches. And that's good. But the main thing I learned about God is that He is a Mystery, and I was fundamentally unsatisfied with the way that Protestant churches tend to want to de-mystify everything. Practical relevant sermons that will help you live a better life merely left me hungrier than before I came. I'd always thought the Catholic Church was fundamentally wrong because _sola Scriptura_ (I spent a lot of time in PCA and LCMS churches). But, about a year and a half ago, I looked around my life and found myself spiritually depleted; and the thought came to me that _maybe it's time to rethink what I think I know about the Catholic Church_. \n\nI attended a Catholic Ash Wednesday service last year, and as a result of that experience I decided to start a [reading program where I'd read through the entire Bible and the entire Catechism in one year](http://chnetwork.org/2012/08/free-resource-updated-version-of-our-read-the-bible-and-the-catechism-in-a-year-guide/), with the idea that I was going to keep a sharp eye out for places where Church teaching contradicts Scripture. I just finished this program and of course the number of times contradictions happened was zero. About four months into this program I realized that there was no going back. So I started attending Mass, alone at first -- going to 8am Mass by myself then taking my wife and kids to the Lutheran church at 10:30 -- and fully expecting to live in a dual-faith marriage. But much to my surprise my wife embraced this journey as well! We all started RCIA (kids in faith formation) last October, and, well, here we are. \n\nI am more than ready to get this done tomorrow. My confirmation name will be Augustine, after the saint to whose works I was introduced when I first started going to back to church in the mid-1990s and who has been a constant traveling companion even before becoming a Catholic ever made it onto my radar screen. My 6-year old son's saint will be Ambrose, who helped convert Augustine and I feel like my son still is the #1 driving force in my own ongoing conversion. \n\nI'm saying all this for two reasons. \n\nFirst, I have lurked this subreddit constantly since last spring, posting occasionally but reading voraciously each day, multiple times a day, and I want to say **thank you** to all who hang out here. It's not overstating to say that /r/Catholicism has had a co-redemptive effect in my life over the last 18 months, and you may not realize it but God has used you to help me. \n\nSecond, I want to encourage anyone who is in the same spot that I was in. Keep reading about the Church and learning about it, talking about it, making and owning and correcting your mistakes about it. It all works out for good.\n\n**UPDATE:** Thanks so much for your prayers. It's done! I have a great sense of peace and look forward to what lies ahead. Also I will be smelling like chrism for a year, because my priest literally used almost a half cup of the stuff on me. (Hey, why hold back right?) "

The church fixed issues like a rapidly declining population and resulting economic and cultural collapse, and a population of abandoned, unwanted women and children. The emphasis on commitment to a single partner no matter what, combined with the emphasis on having reproductive sex (as was naturally intended), fixed so many horrible society-crippling flaws.\n\nIt was absolutely an enlightened choice for the time, considering that the church was born from a dying culture (a dying culture that resembles our own, a little more every day).\n\nIt's really frustrating that people criticize things without understanding what the rules are meant to prevent.

When you're dead, none of your problems matter, everything ceases, and ceases to exist. Being that happy is like death. There is nothing within you but raw and perfect emotion. It's an intensely complex thing to consider, yet at the same time it's so incredibly simple. It's really beyond the scope of description, almost beyond comprehension. When you're that perfectly happy, you could be killed right then and there, and you'd welcome it. You're the only thing in my life that has ever caused me to exist in such a perfect state. I don't understand how you affect me in such a way, but this is why I will always love you. This is why I will stand by you at all costs. There is no way for me to determine with any amount of certainty if you feel something similar for me. I can only hope you have and still do. But you've caused in me one of the most powerful and abstract experiences a human can have. I wouldn't trade that for my own life. "

I had a 3 1/2 page long list of sins that I spent about four hours compiling last weekend.  It took about half an hour to get through them all with him stopping me every so often to ask a question or offer some insight or advice.\n\nOne thing he pointed out, which was actually an insight I had myself while doing my examination of conscience, was how much of my list was related to my relationship which I ended a few weeks ago.  That relationship was leading me again and again into sin and was causing me to be someone I wasn't.  He also said it sounds like I would've come back into the Church sooner had I not been in that relationship, which is probably true.\n\nAt the end Father told me I made a very good confession and it's obvious I put a lot of thought and reflection into it.  He offered me some advice on growing my spiritual life going forward (the most important being DON'T GO BACK TO MY EX and also don't wait nine years before my next confession).  He suggested I start getting involved in the parish to surround myself with people who will help me be a better person rather than people who will lead me to sin.  He's going to introduce me to the head of the parish's fraternity of the Secular Franciscan Order, which was something I was considering pursuing before I left the Church, so I'm pretty excited about that.\n\nFor my penance he told me to sit in quiet prayer and just listen for 10 minutes followed by praying a decade of the Rosary (my choice of mysteries) for all the people in the world who are suffering and have no one to pray for them.  I did that as soon as I got home.\n\nSo that's it!  I'm now officially back in communion with the Catholic Church!  We don't have daily Mass on Thursdays and Saturdays and I work early on Fridays, so I won't be able to get to Mass again until Sunday, but I'm so excited that I'll be able to receive the Eucharist again!\n\nWhat a great start to Lent!  Thank you to all who have encouraged and supported me this past month.  How good is the good God!"

I've talked to many of you and it makes me sad that so many of you are completely disgusted with some of the developments of the Church in the last one hundred years and believe there are no redeeming qualities left at present. Believe me - I've been there too. We've all heard our parish priest make weird, unorthodox justifications through a citation of Vatican II. We've all seen abhorrent violations of the Ordinary form of the mass. We've all heard older parishioners cheer on how much better the Church is now than it was in the olden days. And I agree that Vatican II was interpreted far too liberally and implemented in an abhorrent manner. The problem is that these extremely incorrect interpretations are simply that - extremely incorrect. We should all educate ourselves on what the Council actually said and working from there instead of just hating caricatures of it.\n\n\nHowever, I really, really implore anyone that feels that the Second Vatican Council is a complete break in tradition or a complete break from legitimate continuity to reconsider. \n\n\nI've tried reasoning with many of you. However, this is Reddit and I'm not an authority figure. I wouldn't expect my views to immediately be accepted. Maybe try reading some of these sources instead of listening to me.\n\n* [Prefect of the CDF says seeing Vatican II as a 'rupture' is heresy](http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2012/11/30/prefect-of-the-cdf-says-seeing-vatican-ii-as-a-rupture-is-heresy/)\n* [Tradition, Continuity, and Vatican II](https://www.thecatholicthing.org/2010/08/05/tradition-continuity-and-vatican-ii/) \n* [Does Vatican II represent continuity or discontinuity?](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/004056391207300402?journalCode=tsja) This one may harder to get your hands on.

Yes - but were largely rooted in tradition. See [paragraph 4](http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html) in this document on the Liturgy, for example. Did doctrine change? No. Did the way the Church looks at the world change? In some ways, yes. In other ways, no. Did the identity of the Church as the bride of Christ change? No. We would do well to remember that this is not the first time in Church history that several changes have occurred all at once. The reforms of Pope Gregory the Great were quite drastic. Pope Pius V introduced some pretty significant reforms in 1570. We don't have an exact date for when the main language of the mass switched from Greek to Latin - but that happened too. My point is that significant changes don't immediately mean that tradition or continuity has been thrown out.\n\nRemember, Vatican II was called by Pope John XXIII - a legitimate exercise in magisterial/apostolic authority. Remember, the documents of Vatican II had to be ratified by a majority of bishops - another legitimate exercise in magisterial/apostolic authority.\n\n\nI understand that after seeing the destructive ways the Council was implemented the desire of wanting to reject it entirely. We must fight that, however. The Second Vatican Council itself was not a bad thing. It was perfectly legitimate and we should make sure to correct our brothers and sisters who think otherwise. "

Claire was a freshman, and I was a senior.  At the time, we were very close but I had a GF and knew that we couldn't date.  Not only that, but like all retarded High Schooler's do, I wasn't a great friend to her.  Needless to say, she still talked to me after all I put her through, and we still talk to this day.  \n\nThe reason why I am writing this is because Claire and I met up for lunch this afternoon, and for the first time in years I got butterflies when she turned around and saw me.  She was stunning - her blond hair, her smile - it was even more beautiful than I remembered...the embodiment of perfection.  Honestly, I think I felt my heart skip a beat.  I leaned in to give her a hug and a kiss on the cheek, and I felt my knees get weak.  We really can have amazing conversations, and today was great.  We talked over sushi about anything that came to our heads, and then it was over.  She gave me a ride back to my office and drove away.\n\nTonight, I am going to go home and have dinner with my fiancee - not Claire, the woman I am marrying in less than 3 weeks - but I will never forget Claire and I will always think about what might have been if I had just been a little nicer, and tried a little harder.\n\n**Moral of the story / TL;DR:**  If you have feelings for someone that you know has those same feelings for you, dont take that for granted.  I know Claire is a redditor, and I hope she reads this so she knows *exactly* how I feel.  "

We went to the same high school and sat next to each other in Spanish class. When I went to college, he and I stayed close, eventually leading up to admitting our feelings for each other and sharing our first kiss in a graveyard. I couldn't be happier than I always am with him. I've been in a few long-term relationships before but I've never been in love before. And my boyfriend is just so understanding and amazing. Even though I'm still good friends with my ex (who I also live with because I'm stuck in a lease), he trusts me so much. He's also so understanding of my Celiac disease, always making sure that he uses mouthwash before kissing me and avoiding eating gluten when we go out to restaurants. I've never met anyone else with his level of kindness and patience. He even asked my mom to be friends with him on Facebook and, even more amazing, they regularly message back and forth! Not to mention the sex, which is utterly mind blowing and also so intimate and loving. Sometimes it's hard to feel like we're not alone in the world, though. I'm a college student in my senior year and he lives at home and works full time, so our schedules rarely line up. We're lucky if we get to see each other once a week. I can't even talk to anyone about it because all my friends support my ex and not me. Yet we still stick it out because of how in love we are. It's hard to see him so seldom, but seeing his eyes light up and feeling the warmth and love that we share in my heart makes it all so much more than worth it. No matter what our futures hold, we know we'll always have each other. Sharing that is the most amazing thing I've ever felt and, even if I can only share this incredible feeling with you guys and not my \"friends\", I'd never give it up for all the world.\n\nTL;DR: I'm so in love with my boyfriend (in spite of adversity and friendlessness) and want to share this amazing feeling with you good people. <3"

This usually involves a quiet dinner out alone, with no special things happening. today I was out for dinner before heading back to my small town motel room and two women came in for dinner. \n\nOne woman was in her mid 40s or 50's and obviously there with her elderly mother. They took a seat behind me thanking the server with \"thank you sir for your kindness\". \n\nThe moment I set my eyes on the mother my heart sank. In a brief moment I thought it was my SO's mother. The warm hat, tasteful clothing and cane.  My SO's mum passed last year. I remember how much he did for her, and how sometimes that took away from our life together. But those moments were precious. \n\nI finished my meal while silently listening to the conversation going on behind me. The younger woman, the daughter, was explaining and showing her mum how to write things down so she would not forget( she had dementia) and the mum even asked for a business card so she could put it in her memory book to remember having dinner with her daughter that day.\n\nIt was then I knew I had been called to do something memorable. It's nothing overly special, but I simply decided to pay their $25.00 dinner bill. \n\nI gave no explanation, there was no note, nothing. I just paid for their dinner and left.\n\nFast forward an hour and a half, and at my motel room door there was a knock. I surely thought it must just be the staff. When I opened the door the woman, the daughter, was standing before me. I was shocked! \n\nShe said \"you paid for our dinner tonight, thank you, but why?\" (Paraphrased) I told her that my SO had lost his mum just over a year ago and that what she was doing for her mum was worth recognition and it was small but the only thing I could do to help a little. Moms are precious, you only get one. I told her that I know the bills add up and she's probably very tired and that people may not know how tough that life can be.\n\nThe two of us in tears just hugged each other, for a while. Never in a million years did i expect that woman to search every hotel in town to find me and thank me! \n\nShe thanked me for encouraging her and told me how often people tell her to pass her mum off to a care home, but didn't feel right about it. \n\nThis is a moment I will never forget, although her mother might forget, the two us will not. The two of us will remember that strangers can understand each other and support each other. Love each other for their courage and strength in times when it seems too hard to go on. \n\nI had to share this because I couldn't tell my SO for fear of the sensitive topic. But I wanted to share this moment of love And compassion. \n\nWe are all fighting battles, show compassion and understanding and love to everyone. \n\n\nShe owns trail runners k9 Training Centre in Big River, Saskatchewan, Canada\n\nWww.trailrunners.ca \n\nThey train dogs, including in cancer detection ( so's mom passed from cancer). I know this family needs all the help they can get!"

See you either in our future or at least in my dreams...crazy thoughts keep you alive sometimes you know? I wish I was the type to look past all the superficialities and believingly assume that you are definitely not looking for someone as young and immature and even rude and invasive as me, but I can't help but have a giant, concrete reminder of the weight that was put on my shoulders that is truly what gives my life meaning in terms of survival. I can't stop, I see your name everywhere, you just seem perfect and my body/mind just wants to envelop and relax to all the pain and mental beatdowns that you'd potentially give me...the fear, the inability to keep my mouth shut, they're all things that can cause me to be buried dead in a ditch somewhere, but the physics of how incorrectly you may be making these punk-angels fly into glory is what keeps me wondering about you...are you evil, are you just supremely good and loyal, why is my id searching for YOU in particular? Is the fact that children would be involved an accessory to my boredom yet an addition to the hell under which I dwell? Why do I worry that you will be hurt need me one day? Why can't I may this stop especially since I know nothing at all about you and whatever you and me are is nothing because it's a one-way street coming from only me, you've long forgotten of my existence since the day I decided to prove to myself that I was wasting my time, and that it's purely physical and nothing but? Is it because we both went through the same quality of abuse but in ways massively improbable to our biological symmetries to be explained by a religion which advocates matrimony and linear customs? Why in the hell am I telling the sun with each passing day that I need to see you naked in the buff? Lawl. I want you to need me all the time, I want you to feel like you can be the owner of my live flesh and you can do whatever you want with me because only you have the right to completely know my body and it's all just so confusing and vulgar and I feel...naked and embarrassed and years have gone by and I still think about how much differently I masturbated, naturally, with each day I interacted with you. I didn't know my legs could really produce such friction, it's adolescence in its rawest shape! I tell myself no, I'll meet someone who I told myself before I met you is more my type, the darker hair version with the nonsense porcelain skin shut I made up to keep my mind creative and pure, but no, I have to meet you...even better than what my mind built up, even stronger than anything I ever knew was capable of sinking my heart with an anvil of no escape? What is happening to me? I just want to be able to smoke it all away, tell myself that I never met you, but I can't. I feel like you are made for me. There are days when I am afraid other women feel the same way, that you may just be creating a dynasty of sorts, a dragon machiavellian grand master of the pushy which had been entranced and hypnotised by your charm. But then I remember that it can't quite possibly be so, because you're a struggling immigrant with a family that you love, just like my dad is. Did my mind suddenly make you my god? Do I need to swallow a psychedelic on my own in order to feel renewed and balanced in my approach to crushes? Why am I here, questioning whether I should even move on my own like I had wanted to just in case we would ever randomly meet by chance? Why did you make it clear to me, yet I have to challenge it? Why did I have to let those angel eyes penetrate me? I swear, every day the image of your face gives my body breath, femininity, the optimism to be healthy and my most authentic self and I just keep wanting you you you why you? I want to crush on other men but looking at them is like looking at a sort of short, narrow wall that makes me want to fall asleep out of boredom. To be able to stare into your eyes every day I don't need anything else in life, I don't want anything bad to ever happen to you. I know I don't know you but I just love you and it's crazy foolish to feel this way toward someone who...how would I even know? But I know that the things we do have in common unleashed a supernatural experience for me when you introduced yourself to me, and you simply shined, you glowed, and it didn't want to go away and whatever is out there is keeping me from seeing it as anything less than proof of magnetism and perfection, if the universe would allow it. What have I done. I silently scream myself into a slumber of this infinite deception. I fear love. I wish i could go back and cry into your arms with the truth of my hurt, but you are a taken man. If there is a way for you to find out about this here right now and my writing about you, then do not be fazed by your initial thoughts before this writing. I wouldn't want you to fall in love with me in the process of my confession, it would deter from the intention. If you felt the spark I did I would wish for it to last but if you didn't then this must be a tragedy for if I cannot wish then I cannot be. You are not with me and I long for you to steal my soul again so I can stare into the mist of your presence how I desire you is a selfish act of a young woman's incapacity to consider the consequences yet I do and even that doesn't stop me because I need to love your flesh with every bit of attention I can give you. Deny me, I drink water and see your knowing. I am flushed and thrilled at that which doesn't even suffice for reality. I am tortured by you with each passing brainwave and my heart skips at your distant movement, incised at my spinal cord meetings I need you! "

I believe it's because of our friendship, and our honesty with each other. \n  He is more than I could ever want, more then I could ever wish for. I love him with everything in me.

She was in my passenger seat and I didnt want to reach over the center console to give an awkward first kiss. I didnt know what to do and eventually it was too late! She said goodnight, got out of my car and began walking away towards her apartment. I was left sitting in my car with a decision to make. I could either go home, or get out of my car and call her name. I chose option two. \n\nI got out of my car and called for her. She stopped walking towards her apartment and turned around. Like something out of a movie, I told her, \"wait just a minute\", approached her, and we shared an intimate first kiss. It was fucking great. \n\nAnyways, I dont usually share this kinda shit but Im so excited I needed someone to share with. \n\nFor all of you guys in post-break ups, I've been there.

Historical Jesus scholars accept this as most likely dating back to what Jesus himself said, and as established as anything we can know he said historically. It certainly fits their criteria of earliness, multiple attestation (also in the synoptics which didn\u2019t use Paul), even embarrassment (cannibalistic overtones etc). All points to a well-established eucharistic tradition BEFORE the Gospels and back to Jesus Himself. Those that actually knew Jesus were meeting together and re-enacting the Last Supper well before anything in the NT was written down. So the earliest, most certain, the centerpiece of Christian practice is not the Bible, not the even the Gospels, but the EUCHARIST.  "

We met, it was the most magical thing I had/have ever experienced even until now.. she was so beautiful that night and I was a complete mess with my work clothes, but still I tried my best to impress.. as the night progressed, we went to a little dance club with her friends.. and I whispered in her ears on the first day I have met her that I would take care of her and be there for her as long as I could.. From that moment on until the first month-verssary, we never missed a day of seeing one another.. I loved her so much from the very first day and I always wanted to see her.. I remembered our first kiss, it was by the poolside, I slowly kissed her forehead, not knowing it was her favorite place to be kissed, and gently kissed her supple lips.. I was all nervous inside and I was so happy she kissed me back.. being with her was the happiest day of my life.. she made me so happy so alive and so special...

It's been a real roller coaster of a ride, and some feel that this is an end, but I understand that this is the beginning.\n\nWhen I was 6 and 8 years old, I experienced traumatic events that would result in a long and grueling battle with depression, self loathing and suicidal thoughts.\n\nAt the age of 13 the depression began to manifest itself, I noticed severe differences between me and other kids my age. I assumed this was because of some shortcoming of mine and could not handle it properly. I was raised a believer, my mother is Catholic and my father was Protestant, so there was no clear direction. When my depressive issues became too much to bear I blamed God. The only being that could help me.\n\nMy battle with God lasted for years, I cursed him because I believe he had cursed me. I grew up hating him. My depression only ever got worse and by the time I became 20 I had a slew of psychological issues. I was terribly afraid of many things, especially people. I hid in my room and played games to occupy my mind, playing until collapse so that I did not have to think.\n\nMy lifestyle had terrible results for my health as well. I barely ate and when I did it was uncooked pasta straight out of the bag. My intestines became messed up as did my back. I developed eczema that was very apparent on my face. I kept this lifestyle up for ten years. Gathering a debt of over 50,000 euros loaning for a study and wasting it, also failing my study.\n\nAfter three suicide attempts, one that landed me in prison, I finally decided that I could not fix my own life. I was ready to die, this last suicide attempt would be my last. Before I would die, I remember praying one more time. I said these words:\n\n\"Jesus, I have done my best to make something of myself, but I have failed miserably. I will soon be dead. If there is something you still want to do before I go, please do\".\n\nI was invited to church by one of my psychologists. Something that is absolutely not allowed. She did not know I was a believer, but felt that I was looking for something.\n\nI went to a Protestant church that she invited me to, figuring this was Jesus' last ditch effort. Mostly to cover my tracks. Should this attempt fail, I could not be blamed for my death, that was my reasoning.\n\nThe service seemed as though it was made entirely for me, I felt such a strong love, such a strong pull. I knew this was Jesus. Offering me one last chance. I wanted nothing more than to be saved. And so with a face full of tears I offered my life to him.\n\nI went back to the struggle of life, after a year passed I found that the Protestant church lacked answers to many questions, while catholics did have answers.\n\nThe struggle never became easy, finally two years back I decided to abandon myself to a Catholic community. Namely Cenacolo. There I separated myself from all I knew to seek recovery. There God transformed me, and I learned to love myself. I learned that my suffering does not only have value, but also purpose.\n\nNow I have been out of community for over a year. I have found a job as a foreman. And on this day, almost three years after making the decision. I finally received the sacrament of confirmation.\n\nJesus saves, his mercy is beyond anything we can understand. No matter what you are going through, he is with you. He loves you. Let him.\n\nThank you for reading this. This is truly a happy day."

In seventh grade I was sitting next to her in PE in the kickball line, and when I had dozed off and she said \"Go\" to me, I became immediately infatuated. In eighth grade we had health together (although we sat on opposite sides of the room), and I couldn't do anything but think about her, a bit cheesy, I know, but it's not a lie either. In ninth we had nothing together, sans exchanging a couple glances when walking past each other in the hall.\n\nNow I'm in tenth grade, and I have history with her. She sits diagonally from me. Every morning I plan out what I'll say to her, and every night bang my head against my bedroom wall when I realize another day has passed, and that I don't have very many of them left. Less than a week ago we've been assigned projects by our teacher in groups of five, and I was miraculously assigned to her group. I'm now with her, in a group, and every moment I'm spending thinking about her I get sweaty and my heart starts pounding. I know I've been fortunate to be in this group with her, and I have the opportunity to talk to her, and I've never been able to get out more than, \"Yeah, that looks good,\" or \"How does this sound?\". When I see all the people that missed their chance, I know for a fact mine is now. There's a week left until this project is due, but after that it's back to square one as far as interaction. I can safely say I have never been more frustrated at myself in my somewhat inexperienced 15 years of living.\n\nI've read about every person's perspective, every website's guide, and I simply can't muster the courage to do it. I can't do the \"small talk\", or \"act natural\"...this *is* my natural! Am I forsaken? Fortunately for me, I think she might feel somewhat elevated above the \"person\" level regarding me. When we exchange glances as I had previously mentioned, she quickly looks away, and other small things like that. I guess that's a pro. I remember spending my summers only wondering if she even knows who I am, please don't let me waste this!\n\nTL;DR: Hermit lvl 99 and I'm in a project with her for another week, and at which point I will go back to dreaming.

Try to share something, anything, every week. It can be a story, like if you helped someone this week or if someone helped you. Maybe you've seen someone do something kind for someone else, or you have an unresolved question or idea you'd like to discuss. You can also stop by just to reply to others.\n\nWhat you share doesn't have to be positive. If something didn't go as planned or has been bothering you, maybe we can add some perspective. Just remember as you write that compassion for others should be a goal.\n\n**ONE MORE THING**\n\nIf you have time, please reply to at least one other comment below. That way you'll play a part in making more compassionate conversations happen on Reddit and possibly in the real world. Thanks!"

Her biggest reason was for the fact that Martin Luther removed 7 books from the Bible. Y\u2019all, when I tell you that it felt like my world was crashing down on me I mean it. I kept rereading it and thinking, \u201cHe did what?! What books is she talking about?! What was bad about those books? Where are they now? How was it okay for him to do that?!\u201d. I couldn\u2019t even focus when I started looking for answers, my mind was all over the place. When I finally found that these books are still in the Catholic Bibles, that was another thing that surprised me because I had no idea that Protestant and Catholic Bibles were different. Once I found that, I wanted to know what more I could possibly find out about Christianity that I didn\u2019t know before. I joined discussion groups that led me to learn more about Orthodox and Catholic Christians and I fell in love with both. However I still know in my heart that I want to be Catholic. I feel that this is where God is leading me. I\u2019ve tried praying the Rosary, going to Mass, reading about saints, and I\u2019m even observing Lent for the first time this year. I\u2019ve seen such a transformation in my spiritual life and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve been looking for. I\u2019m glad I found it in the Catholic Church. Can\u2019t wait for RCIA to start!

Almost 3 years ago, I was in an abusive relationship. To begin with it was mostly just physical, but as the months went on, it became sexual. I was abused for 3 months by someone that was meant to love and care for me. I was still very, very young and I didn't understand the ways of the world so I thought it was my fault. Anyways, I managed to get away after this 'man' tried to rape and kill me.\n\nDuring these events, I became depressed, anxious and nervous. I've developed manic depression, separation anxiety, social anxiety and I break down at the drop of a hat. I didn't have many close friends at this time because I went to an upstanding private school and I was one of the few weird kids who didn't talk much, so I didn't have anyone to talk to about this 'issue' I was having.\n\nForwarding to a year later, I started dating one of my closer friends, let's call him Sam, who I met when he came new into the school. He was nice, funny, but distant. When I told him about my incident with my previous boyfriend, he flipped off the rails, completely, and started threatening thin air. At this point, I was still very conscious of when people got mad, angry or raised their hands. So this scared me and I had a breakdown, Sam didn't understand my problems and he basically told me to grow up. Gladly, this relationship only lasted 5 months; I moved schools and our talking time was going down exponentially, so I broke it off.\n\nDuring the time that I was dating Sam, I met my current boyfriend, who we shall call Jeff. Jeff and I met through our mothers, because I needed people to talk to at my new school and Jeff was attending that school, so our families organised an impromptu dinner for Jeff and I to socialise in a comfortable environment. \n\nAt school we didn't talk much for the first few weeks. I was still having many anxiety attacks and didn't really want to become 'friends' with anyone at that point; I was dealing with self harm/abuse and an eating disorder.\n\nBut over social media, like MSN and facebook, Jeff and I started to talk more and more, and at school we started hanging out more and more. I was still in a relationship with Sam though, but not for long. After 5 weeks at the new school I was single and wondering if dating was really worth it. I was dealing with separation anxiety and loneliness. I was talking to Jeff about this, and we got into a D'n'M about how much people can hide without you even having a clue. We talked about the issues we both had, what bad things had happened to him - then he asked me if I was hiding anything. So I told him, I had never trusted anyone like I trusted him, I felt comfortable with opening up. The best thing about this moment is he didn't flip out, much, or make a massive deal of it. He just talked to me, didn't treat me any differently. It made me feel, accepted. \n\nSoon after, we made a bet to see who could ask the other out first, as I had so foolishly admitted I 'had a slight thing for him'. \n\n19 months and 3 days later, we're happily together. I don't cut as much any more, I eat properly (mostly), he treats me like a princess and makes me feel like I am the most beautiful person in the world. \n\n**Tl;dr: Suffering from multiple mental and health issues after abusive boyfriend, I found my new perfect match and he has helped me on the road of recovery. Happy after 19 months and 3 days.**"

But I got off work early and got ready and picked her up. I never really wanted to do something huge and profound to propose, and I knew that's not really what she'd want either, so here's what I did:\n\nWe went to a little park in my town, where I first told her I love her. She pretty much already knew what was up. We sat down on a bench and I told her I had a present. Instead of giving her the ring, I gave her a little book called *Consider Love*, by Sandra Boynton. Really cute book. Then I said I had another present, and I gave her a mix CD I made earlier. On it was written \"Will you marry me?\" and as she looked at it I got down on my knee and pulled out the ring. I asked her if she wanted another present, she smiled and said yes, and I popped the question. \n\nAfter looking at this sub-reddit and being saddened by the amount of unrequited-love stories and break-up stories, I figured a happy tale of success might warm some reddit hearts.\nTL;DR - tonight I asked my girlfriend to marry me, she said yes, and I'm so happy I had to post it."

Moved to the US, opened a coffee shop and decided relatively late in life to become a priest. He was making great progress to push for restoration of our big beautiful old church. Please pray for him when you get a chance. \n\nEDIT FOR UPDATE:\n\nFr Wagner was diagnosed with an irreversible brain hemorrhage. His family from Poland arrived last night as well as the Archbishop to provide whatever comfort can be given in a time like this. He is on life support now. He began feeling ill shortly after finishing communion, and was taken to the hospital strait from Mass. I, personally, find something poetically, tragically beautiful about a priest falling ill but finishing communion first. Like God said, alright my son, you've served your task faithfully and well, come home. "

In fact, sometimes I've lost all hope and even taken my anger out on my new husband. But he somehow forgives me every time. I have a long journey ahead of me, and I know he probably realizes I'm depressed. But he holds my hand, and he tries his best. Today when I came home from a trip to SF, I flopped onto my bed in tears. I looked to my left, and [saw these words painted all across my mirror.](http://imgur.com/gallery/N0c4c53/new) I think he wanted me to remember how much he loves me. Because he knows how quickly I forget. He knows I struggle to see good in the world, and especially the good in myself. But here it is. A testament and gesture of his love. Damn, I needed it today...\n\n[Here's the full list of his loving words](http://imgur.com/lCYGGb8)\n\nI'm *not* saying mental illness is cured by nice words on a mirror. In fact, it takes professional care, love, empathy, sometimes even medication just to cope. Many people struggle with it mental illness - more than we probably even realize. And instead of showing them hate or anger when they act out. Show them kindness and remind them things can and WILL get better. Everyone needs a little help sometimes. If that person can't be you - see if you have any resources for therapy. \n\nThe thing is... I am not \"too good\" or \"not good enough\" for my husband. We all have our down days. And sometimes we don't handle it well. BUT, we are partners. He is here for me when I'm down. And I cherish that. And he has his down days, too. And I will be there to hold his hand, just like he holds mine. Life can be hard. The answer is never to mock, scoff, or belittle someone. Be kind. Be the best version of yourself. And be most of all- be patient.\n\nI'm still struggling, but I'm glad I have my other half to help me make it through. It may just be a few words on my mirror, but I'll look at them when I wake up and know I'm not alone. I'll know I have my bestfriend, my co-pilot in life to help guide me through. \n\nEDIT: spelling...grammar..."

It was my 7th grade \"sweetheart\".  Coincidentally, our \"relationship\" ended soon after that.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I talk to a lot of girls.  I'm not super social, and I'm really not able to pin-point any group at my school that if fit in with.  I've recently been fighting with some friends, just because of stupid high-school drama.\n\nI didn't think I'd really find anybody right for me in high school, since I didn't really have any success with relationships last year.  I decided to plunge into the world of never going out and socializing, and playing sports with a side of a lot of video games.  As I was saying, I wasn't exactly looking for somebody to get to know.\n\nAnd then she showed up.  This girl that is been friends on Facebook with for a little while.  I was bored, and started a conversation with her.\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\nI was trying to talk to her just to get an idea if what she was like.  Hell, if she was anything like the girls at my school, I was half-expecting to never hear back from her.  About 45 minutes past, and my thoughts?  \"Bitch, just wanted to talk\".\n\nThen my phone went off.  I checked it, and it was from her.  \n\n\"Hey, what's up?\"\n\nWe had a very typical conversation for a good 2 hours.  I was really enjoying our talk, and she told me she was going out to eat, and have me her number.  We continued to talk for about 3 hours.\n\nNext day at school, texted her throughout all of my classes, etc.  I'm really starting to like her, and I hope she likes me back.  Pretty much the same thing as before.  Typical conversation, ending with a \"good night\" after a. 9 hour long talk.\n\nWednesday, I was convinced.  I really enjoy talking to her.  For some reason, she makes me feel...  Different.  She's awesome, open-minded and down to earth.  Regardless of who you are, or your reputation, she will give you a chance and talk with you.  \n\nHer homecoming was tonight, and I was pissed.  If I had known that it was tonight, I would've gone to her school, and made a big deal about it, asking her to go with me.  Instead, I was left without any communication with anybody for about 4 hours.  And, for some reason, I felt sick during those 4 hours.  I felt like I was being repeatedly kicked in the stomach, and I had trouble breathing.\n\nAnd then I got the text: \"Hey!\"\n\nExcited, I respond.  We start talking again, and, oddly enough, the stomach aches are gone.  I can breathe again.  Scrolling through my timeline, I saw some pictures she took with her friends before the dance.  I was blown away.  She was so stunningly gorgeous.  I couldn't believe it.  Words cannot describe how beautiful she was.\n\nIt sucks, though.  Knowing that this will probably just be some high school relationship (if I'm lucky enough), and probably won't be something serious.  It really opens up this pit in my stomach, and I get really anxious, to the point where I want to ask her to go out.  But, I still struggle with it.  The whole reason why I never get into good relationships is because I move way too fast.  It's just, I don't want to wait too long and have her taken.  I love her too much.\n"

We were trying to get an adequate number of bags of food prepared ahead so we could keep the line moving once we started distributing. I didn't see you at first. I was wrapped up in what I was doing.\n\nWhen I looked up, you stood out from the crowd. I don't think I've seen you in the line before, though I'm often too distracted by my tasks to notice who is waiting. Your red sweater caught my attention. It was a pop of color on an otherwise gray, dreary, cold April day.\n\nIt wouldn't have taken a rocket scientist to determine you were cold. Your shoulders were hunched forward. Your arms were crossed around your midsection; your hands rubbing the areas around your elbows and forearms. I know that pose. I posture that way when I'm cold, too. I hate being cold. It's almost a painful experience for me. You looked like you were experiencing that level of discomfort; you were experiencing painful cold.\n\nI thought about giving you my jacket, but then the woman I was working with asked me to carry a box of produce for her, and I became distracted. I returned to my task. \n\nShortly after, I noticed you again, lady in the red sweater. You looked even more uncomfortable. You looked miserable. The line was not yet moving. You were going to be there a while. \n\nMy feet were moving before I had even thought it through. I walked away from my table, moving my phone and keys from my jacket pockets to my pants pockets as I walked. When I reached where you were standing, I was already unzipping the jacket and taking it off. \u201cHere. I think you need this more than I do right now. I'm moving enough back there that I'm plenty warm. Please, take it.\u201d \n\n\u201cI can't do that. You'll be cold. Thank you, though,\u201d you, the lady in the red sweater said, smiling kindly.\n\n\u201cI'm fine. We won't be slowing down any time soon. I'm almost sweating,\u201d I said. \n\n\u201cAre you sure? I'd give it back,\u201d you replied.\n\nI helped you put the jacket on. \u201cWear it as long as you need. If I get it back, I'll be happy to have it, but if you need it, take it. Work gave me that jacket free. It's not a big deal to me.\u201d\n\nI went back to my work station and returned to filling bags of food. I picked up the pace to try to make up for the lost couple minutes and to try to stay warm. The line started moving. We started distributing food 30 minutes early because of the size of the crowd, the cold and the drizzling rain. I was still working rather quickly, trying to keep up with the demand as the prepared bags disappeared. Then I caught you out of the corner of my eye, and you were walking toward me. I stopped what I was doing. You had something in your hand.\n\n\u201cI give these to people who I believe are angels on earth,\u201d you said, handing me a lace angel affixed to a red ribbon. \u201cThis jacket is a Godsend. I can't thank you enough. You are my angel.\u201d\n\nI'm not sure if you saw how touched I was. I'm sorry I sort of froze. I was trying not to tear up in front of a crowd of people. In hindsight, I wish I had hugged you.\n\nYou told me I was an angel. But you were my angel. I've been in a rut. I've been dwelling on my failings and weaknesses. You reminded me that while I'm deeply flawed and deeply struggling, there are things about me that are good, and things that are lovable. You showed showed me a kindness exactly when I needed one. You were the face of God to me; the face of God in a red sweater.\n\nEDIT: Formatting."

Looking intently into it, I observed and saw the four-legged animals of the earth, the wild beasts, the reptiles, and the birds of the sky. I also heard a voice say to me, \u2018Get up, Peter. Slaughter and eat.\u2019 But I said, \u2018Certainly not, sir, because nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.' But a second time a voice from heaven answered, \u2018What God has made clean, you are not to call profane.\u2019 This happened three times, and then everything was drawn up again into the sky.\"\n\nThis passage marked a milestone in the early Church, as it convinced many people that God also invites Gentiles (not only circumcised Jews) to believe in Christ. But it also served to declare all foods ritually pure...which meant that pork (including bacon) was no longer an impure food!\n\nFor the last 8 years or so, many of my friends and I have celebrated Baconmas by cooking bacon for one of our meals; if you enjoy bacon, then I encourage you to honor God's infinite wisdom and mercy by doing the same. Merry Baconmas to all, and to all a good night! "

I was sitting in the bathroom, and it was a bit noisy, so I thought \"Where is a silent place where could sit and be completely honest and open about my troubles in prayer?\" and then I pictured sitting alone in a pew inside a large, empty candle-lit church.\n\nThat's when the thought occurred to me that our traditional churches, hymns, and the mass, help you with however you are feeling. Those things all look and sound beautiful, but they don't aim to elicit an emotion or tell you how to feel. If you are feeling sad, the mass isn't a chore where you have to pretend.\n\nMy dad is a Pentecostalist, and his church's worship is a loud rock band and long, Apple keynote-like sermon. But that has no place for people who are down. You can't sit and pray quietly, because you can't ignore the pumped up atmosphere. Everything around you tells you to be entertained and have fun, and it's so social and community-based, so it's difficult to seclude yourself without seeming unsocial.\n\nIf I'm very happy and feel fulfilled and walk into a church, it doesn't change how I feel. I can sit down, admire the stained glass, pray with candles around, and everything in that church is compatible with a good mood. I could look at the rood cross, and stations of the cross, and be reminded of Christ's sacrifice, and then feel joyful of God's mercy and the gifts He has given us.\n\nBut if I'm feeling sad and walk into a church, there's nothing to make me feel misunderstood. The stained glass, candles, and artwork don't pressure me to cheer up, they invite me to stay and talk to God. In this case, I could look at the very same crucifix and stations of the cross, and cry with awe and ask for help.\n\nI think I'm starting to better understand the \"timeless\" and \"universal\" aspect of Catholic worship and traditional architecture that I've often heard about. Mass, adoration, confession, the rosary, and just about everything else aren't (or shouldn't be) things you have to be in a good mood to enjoy or value. Whatever we are feeling, we are welcomed by our churches. It's all objective, and speaks to us in different ways, much like scripture. As opposed to being emotion-based, and only relevant at some parts of our life.\n\nI just wanted to share this, maybe it will help someone else. I've never really looked at things this way."

And it\u2019s not about the sweet time and beautiful memories that you cherish. Love also includes disappointment, regret, sadness and many other complicated things and some memories some we cannot forget, which is caused by love. While some memories we could cherish that\u2019s caused by true love. One thing that I\u2019ve learned is, true love happens only once and it will make you complete. But if it keeps on happening again and again it\u2019s not true, it\u2019s just infatuation. True love makes you to fight, it will hurt you, and you will have to make sacrifices, but in the end you will be happy. To make the one that he/she love to enjoy a great life and happiness they may have to sacrifice many things even his/her own life. In my own words It\u2019s better to hurt myself than to hurt the one that I love. Love never gives up if it\u2019s true, but in Love he/she may not always be yours. Love is complicated and sometimes does not make sense. Love will never end, it\u2019s true even you would have already moved on and would have got hurt by the one that you love,you will never stop loving him/her and you will never can hate him/her even he/she already make your world upside down. Love is crazy \u2026 yeah you will do something crazy and may be out of your mind just to prove it you love him/her and will do anything for him/her. Peoples often says that love with your heart but don\u2019t forget to bring your brain, I think sometime in true love people do not bring on their brain instead they brings their heart and would get it hurt. That is why Love is a feeling and also Love is blind cause only to our heart love makes sense. The more we love the more we will get our self hurt, but We can\u2019t live without love cause only love makes our life meaningful and teach us how to grow in life. In Love we walk, we fall, we get up, we run, we bleed, we laugh, we cry, we breath, we move \u2026 Love inside it, that my life keeps moving and never stop. If you already willing to do that, that\u2019s would be love in yours."

I can put aside my personal beliefs and laugh. I frequently do, because really it usually doesn't matter and it's funny!\n\nSausage Party/Seth Rogan is the most morally bankrupt, self righteous, nauseatingly arrogant, pile of decaying filth and unfunny garbage that has ever existed on this planet.\n\nEverything about the movie from it's condescending middle school atheist philosophy to it's hypocritically racist attempt at shock humor is an offense to the viewer, decency, and comedy itself. The basic point of the narrative can be essentially boiled down to \"God isn't real, so if you believe in any sort of sexual morality, or don't participate in a literal orgy, you're just a dumb ignorant prude.\" This isn't a subversive message artfully or deceptively delivered. The movie's message is a massive rhetorical wooden stake and the movie is the heavy handed mallet that pounds that message into you with the subtlety of an elephant jumping over a tank of sharks from atop a moving train.\n\nMy favorite is Seth Rogan's debate with Kristin Wiig's straw man of a theistic take on sexual purity. Which basically makes the chaste girlfriend out to be an irrational dimwit who should just cave to her atheist male overlord and quite literally bend over to his wishes because he's smart and knows the truth about god. Feminism dies as Sausage Party tells girls who want to wait for marriage that a woman's right to autonomy over her sex life ONLY applies when she wants promiscuity. How DARE you deny your boyfriend sex? You need to be liberated from the patriarchy and take control of your body away from men (by allowing as many of them as possible to have their way with it).\n\nMost offensive though, isn't the gross unearned sense of superiority Rogan feels over people who believe in god. What bothers me the most about this hour and a half long masturbation session for people who make Spaghetti monster jokes and worship Neil Degrasse Tyson, is how belligerently UNFUNNY it is! Race jokes are funny. Sex jokes are funny. Hell, I actually love really bad puns that make everyone groan in disgust. You know what's really not humorous in the slightest? The remaining hour and twenty minutes of constant race stereotypes, smoking weed, ignorant cultural references, and sex jokes, after the first ten! For a movie that thinks it's so much smarter than everyone else, you'd think its writers might be intelligent enough to come up with something they haven't done in the past five minutes. Perhaps a respite from all the blue humor might make the rest of the dick jokes shocking again! After all, shock humor is supposed to be SHOCKING. after about the 100th \"girl says vagina!!!\" schtick, it begins to become just a tad bit predictable. And I just love how these hollywood types that made this movie SCREAM that america and western culture is such a hostile racist place for minorities like me, and the world must avoid being offensive... unless you are a member of their leftist elite. Then you can be as vilely racist as you want! It doesn't even have to be funny to make up for lack of taste! \n\nI would never have expected this movie to resemble anything good. But the degree to which it was so mind-blowingly awful makes me want to gouge out my eyes. I hate this kind moral superiority with a passion, and most of all I hate how insulting it is to moviegoers' intelligence. Please help me by never giving money to the makers of this movie and telling your friends to make better use of their time as well. For the love of god I beg you to stop funding Seth Rogan's repugnant career.\n\nEdit: I am very aware raunchy comedies are deplorable and depict immoral behavior. I prefaced this rant by saying I love those comedies. Superbad, Step Brothers, Role Models, 40 Year Old Virgin, etc. Sausage party is the first I have come across to combine unfunny hypocrisy, unfunny sex jokes, and gross self righteousness in a very clear message that is actively opposed to belief in morality itself. movies that show sex are not bashing girls who want to wait until marriage. Movies that make fun of religious people don't make it the central point of the narrative. "

Well, this feeling has only been getting stronger and stronger. I no longer can bear with the fact that I'm going to leave it in less than a month, and this is why I'm trying my best to stay 6 more months here, because I feel like i'm not done with this place, my time here doesn't feel complete, I need to stay here more. And I will.\u00a0\n\nNow what does this have to do with you? Well, you're the first Scottish girl I've really ever met and spent a bit of time with. You know how when you go on a trip and you fall in love with someone (well, it's more an illusion of love but you get the idea), and then you leave that person, and even if you don't talk to them anymore, they come up in your memory every time you think about the country? I think this is what happened to me when I met you, Sarah. I associate you with my memory of Scotland. Except that we actually talked a lot during the short time we spent together. We had fun. We enjoyed it. I'm sure that I probably enjoyed it a lot more than you have, but I know you enjoyed it at least a little bit, and that's all that matters. \u00a0\n\nIt might be quite obvious now, I think, but I'm an overly sentimental guy, and when I like someone, I really want to see that person more and become sometimes selfish. I thought of myself as extremely pathetic for a bit more than a month after you told me we should stop seeing each other (Might be rather cringy but Radiohead's song \"Creep\" resonated particularly well within me, and I might've shed a tear or two while listening to it during that period), but now I feel better about myself, and definitely have learned many things. Travelling alone does make you grow a lot, and I'm sure you'll come back much different from your time in Australia.\u00a0\n\nOnly regret is that we couldn't do the things we said we might do together, like climbing the Scott Monument, watching \"I, Daniel Blake\" at the Cameo, or going to a Ceilidh (Although I've been to like 5 ceilidhs in the past 2 months and I've gotten quite good).\u00a0\n\nI'm probably not going to send you this because I've been annoying enough times and I don't want to upset you. But, if the time ever comes...I will.\n\n\n\n"

They say it just happens. \nNo, it isn't.\nLove, for me, is how I feel for you. It didn't just happen. I got to know you and I adored the soul that you are. I was in awe, day after day, as I slowly got to know you. I've never met anyone who'd want to be; who was, as selfless, caring and innocent as you are. \nI've never known anyone who kept their priorities and stuck to it. I've never known anyone who was so at peace with their life that they could just close their eyes and go to sleep. I've come across quite a few people in my life, and none of them have made me look at life the way you do. That no matter what, no matter what. If you can hope and pray and believe in yourself, you can make it alright. Even if it isn't, it's what your soul needs you to believe, it's what makes you function. It's what makes you want to live another day. \nI've never met a person who'd be loving enough to not swat a bug, and instead, push it away. I've never met anyone who's so caring that they'd give their slippers to someone who doesn't have them, in the blistering heat. I've never known an empath, someone who cares for this world like it's their own, even after knowing they're one in 6 billion people. I've known extroverts and utterly talkative people, but nobody who could take five minutes off when they're feeling off and come back as happy and optimistic as you are. \nYou, are everything I'm not. \nI'm a realist and I can't bring myself to believe that love is a fairytale with a garden of roses and everything else. I think I went through that once and was proved wrong, with it taking a fair toll on me. \nEvery minute I get to spend with you, every day I get to be there for you, every second I spend caring about you and telling you it's going to be okay, even when I stopped believing so, is love. \nI can't love you like you love me. I can't write words beautifully and express myself like you do, so much that it's artistic in its own beautiful way. I can't open up my heart to you as easily as you can, and put it into words and make you understand how you make me feel. But I can hold your hand through it all. I will, be there for you. I will support you through the best and the worst times of our lives, and give everything in me to see you accomplish your dreams. I have chosen to love you, and I will choose to love you. I will always choose to love you if I had to make a choice. Because you're the best thing to happen to me, even when I thought I'd never get back up from what life had thrown at me. But he did bring you to me, and I'll forever be grateful for that. He saved me through you, my saviour. \nI know I'm still a mess. I am holding the last straw and desperately clutching on to it and trying to stop my family from falling apart. And you, being there with me, is all the strength I have that keeps me going. And just because you say so, I know that one day it's going to be okay. My dad will accept my brother back to our family, and he will talk to us properly, and mother will be happy with where our life has come. I will get to stand in a proper family photo that I've seen with everyone else, excluding me. That twenty years of drama and stubbornness will come to a happy ending. I somehow believe that, only after you've come in my life. I also believe that, on some level, that will happen because of you. \nI've never met a soul that radiates happiness like you do. With a pair of eyes that look at me like I'm everything to you, and a heart that's as kind and loving as yours. \nYou make me want to be more like you. \nThe past year has been absolutely wonderful with you, and I, for one, know that it's just the beginning. Because good things happen to good people, and you're the best thing to happen to me. \nHappy one year. :)"

I\u2019m successful, beautiful, witty, intelligent, well-educated and have a robust social network full of wonderful family and friends. But inside I\u2019m fighting a constant struggle against imploding. \n\nIt\u2019s a crushing and lonely process. I have a wonderful mother and father, but mom waxed and waned in and out of depression for most of my childhood and dad was a mere distant observer, allowing her to succumb to her episodes. As a result, I learned not to rely on mom for much and took to being as grown up as possible at a very early age. Affection, love and interest in my emotional well-being were inconsistent at best.\n\nThe thing about attachment disorder is that you don\u2019t realize you suffer from it because to you it\u2019s reality. I can\u2019t comprehend that some people go through life with the ability to self-soothe in a way that opens them up for loving and lasting relationships. I fight every day against the demons of loneliness, self-doubt and an irrational fear of never being loved. When I do meet someone special, I fear that they\u2019ll only be there until they \u201cfigure me out.\u201d And then they will leave. I've been guilty of prematurely ending relationships because of this.\n\nMy early adulthood was an outward projection of this crushing loneliness. I abused myself with sex and alcohol as a way to calm the hungry beast seeking love and affirmation inside of me, since I couldn't give it to myself. Ten years have gone by and I've managed to stop most of these behaviors, perhaps one of my biggest accomplishments to-date. I still smoke though. Addiction is characteristic for an adult with an attachment disorder. You wouldn't guess it looking at me, my job or my lifestyle. I hear on a weekly basis \u201cI\u2019m surprised you smoke, you don\u2019t look like a smoker.\u201d This is why, I\u2019m so scared and lonely inside that it hurts, and smoking is one of the last bad habits left from a destructive youth of attempting to self-soothe through. Compared to the sex and alcohol, it\u2019s the least harmful.\n\nSome days I\u2019m fine and others are awful. There\u2019s absolutely no reason someone as young, beautiful and vibrant as myself should have to worry about a life of loneliness. I even know it\u2019s absurd, yet I can't stop it. It doesn\u2019t turn off. I work on it daily, go to therapy and think positively about a better future. It is getting better with age, but I can\u2019t help but mourn the youth I lost to this terrible disorder. \n\nIf you meet someone like me who seems almost too perfect but you have a nagging feeling there\u2019s something under the surface that you just can\u2019t put your finger on, ask them. Ask them how they feel. Know that people like me have more of a capacity to love and cherish someone than anyone could hope for in a partner. We've just had a rough go of it and have a hard time in the beginning since uncertainty feels like death to us. The part of a relationship where most people feel excited terrifies us because the person might leave. We are looking for a sure thing. If you think you know someone like me and want to be their partner, ask them. Ask them how to make it work. I assure you that you\u2019ll unlock years upon years of happiness by finally helping them to set themselves free.\n"

For us, Mary showed up exactly once a year, gave birth to Jesus on Christmas, then effectively vanished until the next December. When I converted to Catholicism, I assented to the Church's teachings on Mary, though I never really internalized them to the point that they held any significance to me personally. Until tonight.\n\nFather Ignatius refers to Jesus' \"Last Will and Testament\" with these poignant lines:\n\n>Oh how great is the gift bestowed upon us by Jesus in this His last will and testament! Our dear Saviour has nothing else on earth to leave us but His own most holy Mother. His Body He has delivered up to the fury of His enemies, His Blood He has shed for the redemption of the world, His garments the soldiers have divided among themselves; nothing therefore remains for Him to bequeath, save His most blessed Mother, and her He leaves to John and to all Christians in his person.\n\nAll this time, I thought of Mary as the Mother of God, and I even got so far as to think of her as a quasi-step-mother to Christians, but this gave me a moment of clarity tonight. Jesus gave his mother to *all of us*, and all of us to His mother as her children. Not step-children, not foster children. Just sons and daughters. And as such, our obligation to her is as to our biological mother. I'm honestly overwhelmed by it.\n\nI'm sure a lot of folks in this sub have good relationships with Mary. I'm jealous of you all, in the most unsinful way I can be jealous, that is. I want to do better by her. I've neglected my relationship with her for far too long. Please pray for me."

Since then I've been deployed twice. I've been in a few life or death situations. I'm not going to lie; I've thought about you the entire time. Remember last December? I surprised you at work with two dozen red roses in my dress uniform. I was leaving that next week to go on deployment. When you ditched me on our coffee date that weekend broke my heart. I remember how you always talked about seeing the world. Seeing the beauty outside the United States. I've taken hundreds of pictures. Some of the most beautiful things I've ever seen I got on picture; None of them compare to you though. You run through my head about once an hour. I don't know if I'm crazy or in love. I don't know if I'm mentally ill or if this is normal. I miss you like crazy. I wonder if you ever think of me like I think of you. If you ever look at the stars and wonder if I'm okay, or if I'm alive. I hope you don't. I don't want you to go through what I'm going through. Even though you led me on for months after the break up I still love you. Even though you promised we get together again, and never did I still love you. Even after you got a boyfriend two weeks after we broke up; I still love you. You were the first woman I've ever fell in love with. The only woman I've ever made love to. The only human I've ever truly cared about. You are a perfectly orchestrated collection of atoms; Perfect enough to make the cosmos jealous. I can't help but think of you. When I was in the ICU, completely dependent on a machine for survival, the memories of us is how I survived. I will never forget you. I hope you are happy with him. I hope one day you tell me why you left me. I hope one day you'll be proud of me. I'll never forget. Remember the lightning bugs..\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for actually reading this. I have hopes that there is a slim to nothing change that she will read this.  I just want her to know her I feel about her. She has my phone number blocked, facebook blocked and I don't want to harass her.\n\nIF by any chance you are reading this please know...\n-You mean more to me than you'll ever know.\n-I'm sorry for whatever I did; If you would give me a chance, even to be friends, you wouldn't regret it.\n-I'm willing to change everything about myself for you.\n-I wasn't mad when you bought two 1,000$ cats, I'm not mad at you now.\n-Being in the dark about everything is eating away at me. Why did you do it? What did I do? Did you know I was going to propose that night? Do you know how hard it was to cry and beg for you back infront of you? \n-Atleast call me so we can get closure...So I can get closure.. I have the same phone number.\n\nPs.- I still have the ring if you want it.."

I know it sounds clich\u00e9 and all but its true. Everything you read in those corny novels, all those feelings, its true I won't deny it. Being with you makes my heart want to jump out of my chest, feels like fireworks exploding by the second. Pulse fastens cheeks redden my stomach tickles my breathing become heavier. Everything around me blurs but you. You stand there like finding a shiny object on the beach and the sun just gleams at it and it catches your attention because it just stands out above everything else. That is you. You don't get it. I've never felt this strongly about someone ever before. I don't even understand why. I love watching you smile, I love when you pull me in for a dance, the way you tickle my stomach, I love watching you sleep, I love the way you pull off goofy faces and your sweet caramel eyes, I love your beard shaved or not, I love your beer belly and your so strong arms, I love your bitten fingernails and your nicknames for me, I love how you call me your princess and your queen, I love how you treat me like a kid but as an adult as well, I love when you are goofy and when you mature up too, I love your job and the passion you have for it, I love how dedicated you are, I love your english, Italian, and Spanish, I love your hairy body, I love your dimple and the mole just on top of it, I love your sweet kiss and your hands entwined in mine, I love your so advanced terminology and wording, I love that you make me laugh, I love when you sing to my ear, I love our dances and you spinning me away to another world, I love our deep talks and small talks and all of our talks actually, I love everything about you and me together, I love you, all there is to you, every last bit of it and I love how you are with me, so sweet all the time, a true romantic but a good man at the same time, plain perfect for me in reality. You always make me happy, not once made me cry. I love how you hold me so so tight, in a hug, how you never want me to go. I love that you have never let me go. Remember the time you asked me out on a movie and by mere coincidence my parents agreed on letting me go. I mean you knew my parents never let me go out on Sundays, I obviously spent hours trying to convince them. But I just thought you were worth it, all that convincing. I can't have enough of you, every moment spent I get greedy and want another one, and another one after that. When I'm not with you I feel incomplete I miss you. I feel a pit in my stomach. Yea, I can pull off a smile and pretend to be all right but if you read my mind, read into my thoughts, all our memories is the only thing you'd see. I can't stop thinking about you, every moment of every day. I just fell deeply in love with you, honestly from the moment I saw you, I just knew from the top of my head you were the one. If it were up to me, God, you'd be the boy I'd want to marry. Being with you just feels right, you know? I'm sorry I don't tell you this but how could I? If you left after everything is said, I would be mortified. The biggest pain I'd feel besides missing you. Damn it don't you get it? Don't you see it? You're probably the only one who doesn't. Boy I'm madly in love with you."

Its an RTS MMO, a game where you build a city, build armies, and take other peoples stuff. Well I was in the top guild of this one world and they used a separate app for their communication(since the chat system in this game was bad at best). The app was set up in \"rooms\" created by the guild leaders. We had a war room, a defense room, and a casual room. Well I liked chilling in the casual room chatting with the other people in the guild and one day(mid July) me and this girl start chatting and our conversation goes on for hours. At one point someone calls us lovebirds and the conversation breaks and she goes to bed(Im EST, she's middle EU, so 6 hours ahead). A few days go by then she sends me a private message and we start chatting again. For a while its just about the game and good ol' BS. But after about 2 weeks or so the conversation gets deeper and we start talking about our daily lives and stuff like that. By the time September rolls around we're still talking, and more than ever. We've even facetimed, and by this point for over 100 hours easy. Near the end of September, we're talking about the kind of people we're into, and i eventually go for the risk all and tell her that I like her. As my heart races and sweat drips from all over me, frightened out of my mind for losing this good friendship that we've built, she responds and says the feeling is reciprocated. A few days later, I go for it again, pronouncing that I think I love her. She responds positively, and says she thinks she loves me too. I'm so happy that its crazy. She's 4000 miles away, how could we love each other?\n\nCome December we exchange christmas gifts. By this point we're a regular couple(except for the distance). We share everything, even dirty thoughts. I searched for hours for the perfect necklace for her, and when she got it she loved it, wore it everyday(A little story about the necklace since I'm so proud of it. She had come to calling me her \"Sun\", since I brought light to her life whenever we facetimed. I called her my angel since she was so sweet and I'm so original. The necklace was of a sun shining on an angel. The sun had an amethyst in the center, which was her birthstone and her favorite color. Thats how you buy a gift). She sent me a 6x6x6 rubiks cube(cause I'm a huge nerd, and the 3x3x3 and 4x4x4 was too easy for me), and a couple books in her language(danish) and a sexy note.\n\nFebruary is her birth month, and she's turning 18(I'm still 17), and I've decided that I now want to go see her, in person, in her country(Denmark). So she asks her parents if it would be okay for me to stay there for a week and they say its fine. I ask my parents... and they say no(understandably). I'm still left loving this girl I've never \"met\" and my chance to see her during one of her school breaks is gone(I go to american public school so if i skip days its not like I miss anything). We're pretty sad but we keep optimistic about seeing each other one day.\n\nNow it's April. The earth is warming(northern hemisphere at least), flowers are blooming, and love is still in the air. We've had our ups and downs like every couple(distance making it even harder), but I'm desperate to make it work, and apparently so was she since we stayed together. My birthday is in the middle of June, the perfect time to go sightseeing in Europe. So I ask my parents if I can go to Europe to see(or meet, whichever have you) my girlfriend. They say they need to think about it. This of course brings up excitement for me and my girlfriend and we start looking up plane tickets and stuff to do like its a sure thing that I can go. A few days pass and my mother tells me that I am not allowed to go(my parents are divorced btw, so mom's decisions and dad's decisions aren't connected the way they are if they were still together). This breaks my heart. I tell my girlfriend and it breaks hers too. I'll be 18! I beg and plead. I'm an adult! But the answer stays no. I hold this from my father as to not influence his decision with any negative thoughts. A few days after this my dad says he wants to talk to me. We go for a drive and stop in the middle of Amish country on the side of some back road. He tells me he knows what my mother's decision was, and he sees her point of view. I'm devastated, thinking this means that he agrees. But he, like a true champion, says that he thinks I should go and won't let my mother stop me from having the opportunity to do so. As long as I want to go, he'll get me there. I nearly jump for joy. I'M GOING TO SEE HER. I'M GOING TO SEE MY TRUE LOVE AND STAY WITH HER FOR A WEEK HOLY SHIT I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. We get everything in order, he even gives me $500 to help me buy the plane ticket and have money to spend while I'm there.\n\nFast forward to July 1st. We're going to the airport. My mother(she's accepted the fact that I'm going), my sister, and I are in the car(sister had never been to an airport so she wanted to see it, thats what she said but I know she wanted to say bye too). We park, get my bags checked, and go to the security check. This is where my mom has to leave me go on my own. The flight has a stop in Berlin before connecting to Copenhagen. She tells me to text her before I get on the plane, when I land in Berlin, before I leave Berlin, and when I get to Copenhagen, and not to worry about the extra charges for out of country texting. When she says bye she cries, and tells me to \"be good\"(cause I'm still a kid in her eyes, she even tells me that whenever I go back to college to this day). I wait for the plane, hop on, and go to Berlin. The flight is delayed two hours but whatever. I get to Berlin, race through the airport using what little German i knew at the time to find the right gate, and reach the next flight. I get on, and I'm off to see my girlfriend. I know she'll be waiting for me at the airport. I can't hold my excitement. The lady sitting next to me asks me what I'm here for and why I'm traveling alone, so I tell her a shorter version of this story, and she can't believe it. She wishes me luck and a good time. I land. I'm so excited. I'm so nervous. I don't want to mess anything up or make a fool of myself. I follow the crowd through the airport to the pickup location. There she is. HOLY SHIT THERE SHE IS SHES REAL OMG IM SO NERVOUS DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID. She's about 5'8(just 3 inches shorter than me), blonde, and absolutely beautiful. OH MY GOD SHES REALLY HERE, IM REALLY HERE, WE'RE REALLY HERE. OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG. I race toward her and we embrace. She tries to start a kiss but I'm so nervous I can't even respond and kiss her back, she laughs at my nervousness and grabs my smaller bag. We take a train back to her house, talking about normal stuff the whole way. I caress my fingers along the back of her hand and she takes my hand in hers, and our eyes lock. She has beautiful green eyes with dots of brown. She calls them mud but i think they're amazing. When we get back to her house, she makes me a sandwich for lunch, we eat together, and she goes out to the balcony. I take this time to check her out for the first time without her noticing(though im sure she knew). She has a decent body, way out of my league for sure. Thin, shapely, and gorgeous face. She keeps her hair long and well kept, so it falls around her shoulders as i look at her. I finally gather all the courage that I have and go out to the balcony after her. SLIGHTLY NSFW FROM HERE SO BE AWARE. SKIP TO LAST PARAGRAPH FOR REST OF WEEK. I come behind her and put my hands around her waist. She spins and we kiss. My first kiss, 4000 miles from home. It's exactly like I imagined.  We stay like this for honestly I don't know how long. Our hands roam. I rest mine on her bottom, and she grabs my crotch. I lean in and whisper \"i want you\". Like a command she takes my hand and leads me downstairs to her room. She sets me on the bed and closes the blinds. I'm sure you know where this is going at this point but hang in there just a bit, theres a surprise and its not too graphic, i promise. She gets on the bed, pushes me down and climbs on top of me. We kiss again, and I tell her before we get too into it she can grab the condoms I brought from my bag. She smiles and says its a good time to tell me my birthday present. She says she went on birth control for my birthday. HOLY SHIT LOSING MY VIRGINITY WITHOUT PROTECTION(other than the bc, of course). I don't think I have to tell you the rest. I went from having a batting average of zero to hitting a in field home run, running around all the bases, and scoring home without protection all within an hour. Best day of my life, and the following week is something I still consider to be the best week of my life. \n\nWe spend rest of the day sightseeing. She brings me around to all the places she likes to walk, and shows me an interesting tree(I know it seems weird but it really was a cool tree). After that we go back and have dinner with her parents(kind of awkward considering they had to of known we had sex, although the social scene is quite different there). Her parents were very nice and very fun to be around. During the next few days we stayed attached to each other like conjoined twins. We went to Berlin and I got to use the German that I learned in high school to get us around the city. We went to Sweden another day and I got to see my favorite kind of man-made structure, a castle! We also went to see her grandparents and I had what was probably the best dinner of my life. Everything homemade, from scratch, even the soda. Delicious! I got to meet a lot of her family at her cousins graduation party, they were all very nice. They even made me some special food in case I had a problem with my seafood allergy(turned out all of the food that they made didn't have anything I was allergic to in it, but it was a nice gesture). A great week with a great woman. We slept together every night, cuddling close to each other. We played tons of games(since we're both huge nerds XD). The best week of my life. \n\nThat's my love story. To bring it to the present, we are no longer together. It costs to much money and its too hard to be together. We keep in touch, and still are great friends and are open to the idea of getting back together later in life if the opportunity arises. But whenever anyone says I'd travel around the world for a girl, I actually did, and it was worth it :)"

That would have me worried if that were my son.\" Which of course brought on the whole \"do you think you're better than me?\" argument along with all their reasons why they don't need to be religious. \n\nI'm in pain after about half an hour of trying to explain that I'm not judging anyone - it is not up to me. It's up to God. I feel sorrow because I don't know what to say to get through to them.\nOne tried justifying how they're a better person by being what they judge to be a good person, rather than others they know who claim to be Christians, go to church, etc. yet do not lead a Christian lifestyle. The only thing I said was \"now all we need to do is be a good person and go to church, not split them into one or the other\". \n\nOne said \"I feel like a good person, so why do I need to go to church\" - this one was a Catholic but has strayed away (he's about 50-something) and doesn't seem to be practicing anymore. He's the only one that I straight up said - \"but you should. Don't judge your spiritual condition based on how YOU feel\". Oh boy, did that get him going. I probably shouldn't have said that.  \n\nI have one coworker who is a Messianic Jew - and he is a very kind man. I've had many good conversations with him concerning religion. He's inspired me to try to really try and actually finish reading the Bible. Even though we have different views, we can at least respect each other. I felt like I was being attacked by the others. \n\nI've never felt so isolated in the workplace - I'm sorry, I just needed to vent and didn't know where else to turn right now (I'll probably vent to my wife later as well). I've had my own struggles with Catholicism growing up, but my wife has helped me come back to the church and help me let go of my pride. I'm far from perfect and most likely have more than a few confessions to go to...\n\nI can't help but think of our son and our next baby. I want to do all I can to help them grow up in this messed up world of ours and I know there's going to be pain for them on the way. It hurts so bad to think about. \n\nEdit: thank you all for the supportive comments. I really mean it. "

Did it for her as i couldve spent many years in the same situation but i didnt wanted her to suffer.\n\n3 weeks and during this time i thought about us and came to the conclusion we should totally still be together and i should stop hiding my feelings and met her to tell her.\n\nBut then, she told me she's meeting someone she met on dating website.\n\nAnd oh god how that hurts. 5 days without eating, i feel so mad about myself i let my baby go away and now she's in bed with another guy.\n\nWe met friday and i told her eveything, the mistake, that i trully love her, she freaked out, cried and told me to go away. Then she spent the week-end at her new guy's house. I'm so lost, nothing seems tasteful, i dont want nothing except my baby to comeback.\n\nI told her eveything on friday, that i want her to be happy its the only thing that matter, and so i said because i love her i will let her go and live her new story without me spamming her mail or phone.\n\nSo now i keep silent as i don't want to annoy her, but it hurts so much i dont enjoy anything, life is empty now and i pay for my mistakes. I know i hurted her by letting her alone sometimes, but i never cheated i never lied and it feel so horrible to know the person you love is in another bed, on another harms.\n\nI don't know what i should do, if i should hope, i'm nowhere near to search or date for someone. I feel miserable and broken. I can't handle the fact she's with another man.\n\nThanks very much to tell me how you managed to go through a similar situation, and your advices on how i should proceed to either still hope or to try to go pass this."

            "value": "A few people on here told me to post an update after my meeting with the priest, so here it is.\n\nFor some background, I'm a cradle Catholic who has been away from the Church for nine years now.  When I was in college I was a very devout Catholic.  I'm talking daily Mass going, Liturgy of the Hours praying, 5-fold scapular wearing, RCIA and CCD teaching, vocation discerning Catholic.  After college I had some doctrinal issues with the Catholic Church-- mainly with the Trinity-- and I chose to convert to Judaism.  After about a year as a practicing Jew I just stopped any sort religion and have been mostly irreligious for the better part of the last decade.\n\nThe priest I met with was my spiritual director when I was in college, so he knew me very well back then.  It was a long time ago, though, so, while he remembered a good deal about me and my life and my struggles, I did have to refresh his memory a bit.\n\nI pretty much ran through what I've been up to since I last met with him in 2009.  We talked about how I converted to Judaism and what my spiritual life has been like since.  Then we talked a lot about why I want to come back to the Church now and what events led to me wanting to come back.\n\nIt basically came down to my (very atheist) boyfriend, who I had been living with for three years, asking me to move out of the house.  We're still together, but he didn't want to live together anymore.  While living apart from him I started thinking more about the kind of person I want to be and the kind of life I want to live and a big part of that was my spirituality and what I believe.  While living with him I had no spirituality.  Any sort of spiritual anything was seen as dumb and laughed at.  But I want spirituality in my life.\n\nSo the hardest thing the priest suggested was breaking up with my boyfriend.  He said I don't have to go out and do it tomorrow, but the things I told him about the relationship put up a lot of alarm bells and it's obvious this isn't the person I'm meant to spend my life with.  I've known this for months now, but I've been dragging my feet.  It's honestly going to be the hardest thing about coming back to the Church and I'm sure I'll be dragging my feet for awhile longer before I actually get up the nerve to end it.\n\nThe other thing he told me to do was just discern for now.  To pray and continue to come to Mass and think about if committing to being a practicing Catholic again is something I really want.  He said I shouldn't go all in and then a few months down the road leave again.  I have to really consider the decision and make sure I'm going to stick with it. (I actually wasn't expecting him to be so permissive about it and act like it's a choice)\n\nI told him in my e-mail requesting the meeting I wasn't feeling ready for Reconciliation.  Honestly, if he had asked I probably would've done it today and gotten it over with, but he said he respected that I wasn't ready.  He suggested I make the goal of deciding by Lent if I'm ready to come back into the fold and then I could make Lent a very intense period of renewal for my faith.  I like the idea, but I have a feeling I won't wait that long before going to Reconciliation. \n\nOverall he didn't tell me all that much I didn't already know, but hearing someone I knew so well and had so much respect for say those things made it more real.  I also like his idea of aiming to make Lent my big \"come back\" into the Church, although already in just the past few weeks I've been re-adopting most of my practices from when I was very Catholic.  I really don't know how to be a \"go to church on Sunday\" Catholic.  I've gone to Daily Mass every chance I've gotten for the past two weeks, I've started praying LotH again, and I've got my 5-fold Scapular back on (although I know it doesn't do much while I'm in a state of mortal sin).  I don't know any other way.\n\nSo yeah.  It was a good meeting.\n\nIf you've read this far, God bless you..."

I should have talked less. I should have held you up to the sunshine and admired all the beautiful parts. I wish I hadn't sucked all the air from the room and filled it with my anger. I hope you know, I was only ever angry with myself. \n\nThere's nothing left now but the memories of a life past. I held your mother's hand while she died. We held our daughter when she was born. You held me through so many hard moments. We held each other for so many years, I honestly never thought we'd let go. \n\nYears have passed and life has moved on. We have both found new love and different paths. There are moments when I still remember your face as familiar to me as my own. I will always miss the times we laughed and had our whole lives ahead of us. \n\nMy dear old friend, I've know you for more than twenty years and there have been oceans of words between us. Things said that can never be undone, and noble promises of love and forever that faded with time. In the end, the only words I know that have always been true are these: I wish for you all the love, happiness and joys that life can bring. I hope the broken parts of you are healed and the beautiful pieces continue to shine. Thank you for being the person I loved the most. \n\n[Edited for format and content.]\n\n\n\n"

What a wonderful life this is, absolute bliss!\nI cannot imagine a better life, not even heaven compares!\n\nI gave her my heart, you see, it seemed like heaven, more than that even...\nIt seemed as though time was slower, as though it were forever.\nShe never gave me her heart though, I should've seen this more clearly, but through rose colored glasses... blood is still red.\nShe was tearing me apart, tearing and breaking my heart.\nFinally, when it was over, she took the biggest piece of me, and I suddenly felt the fires of hell.\nI cried out to God, but he didn't seem to answer.\nI thought to myself, was I wrong to give my heart away? All is not lost, only a large part of it is gone... can I make another out of this?\nSo I looked into my mind, it was all I had left physically, other than my body.\n\nI found myself wandering the depths of my mind, I came to find out I could release myself from my body...\nNow, I tried to do this, I genuinely tried to free myself of myself, but this meant giving away my soul, and I had learned not to give something that valuable away so easily.\nSo every time I tried, I failed.\nI tried to dream worlds, I tried to create something more to life, I couldn't do it!\nI became angry with the people around me, blaming them for what had happened to me.\nI began to have wars in my mind, constant struggles with my own feelings, holding them in, it began to eat away at me.\n\nThen...\nI ignored all of it.\nI gave up on it.\nI worked on the pieces of my heart, and I made a new one, although it was smaller.\nSoon after this I met someone, She took a liking to me and I to her as well.\nI began to think about her a lot.\nI didnt give her the heart I made, but I gave her my mind. \nYou'd think I'd have learned from giving my heart away that it'd be a bad idea, but it was more than two weeks, and I didnt give it to her all at once, It was over time.\nI didnt realize what I'd been doing...\nI began to make stories in my head, some unrealistic and some more real than they seem.\nI made a story of us two saving the world, she loved it, she wanted to do it.\nShe wanted to bring the world back to life.\nTo revive it's pulse.\n\nI could hear it's heart, as though it was screaming for a savior.\nLittle did I know, she was dying...\nShe was dying, and I had no heart to give her, mine was too small.\nShe had to leave, and I forgot she had my thoughts, my mind.\nShe left and I realized later... I lost my mind.\nI didnt know how to get it back either, I tried to find her, but it was too late.\nIt was hopeless, I was just a body with a little heart, and a hopeless soul.\nI had the strength to go into the workforce, do I did.\nIt seems like time takes forever now, I can still feel the other part of my heart sometimes.\nI also think about her occasionally, but it isnt clear memories, they're very vague now. \nI'm trapped here, in my home, nowhere to go, nowhere to turn, no one to love.\nIt's hard to be here, and it's hard to do anything... they say \"put your heart into it!\" or \"Think about it!\", it seems like mockery.\nIf only they knew the truth, that I am dying here.\nThey say \"Have faith.\"\nYet they have none.\nThey say \"God loves you!\"\nSo why do I have no love? Why do you hate so bitterly too?\n\nI was going to save the world with her by my side.\nBut she died.\nWe were going to be in heaven forever, but she stole my heart.\n\nSomeone else came onto the scene, I absolutely adored her and still do, but I cant make a home, I'm trapped in this one.\nHow could she love me?\nShe lost so much, I said I did too, but it made her angry, she didnt know what happened. She thought I was lying.\nI tried to give her my heart, but she refused it... maybe I'm lucky, maybe it would've killed me to give her this small heart.\nBut what man wouldn't rather die free than die a slave?\nFREE ME, I beg you.\nYou are my hope at freedom.\nIt's what I longed for.\nHome is my prison, for my heart is stolen and locked away. You are the key.\n"

What it will do (in addition to entertaining you) is demonstrate that you value the same things in a disabled person as anyone else.  That you see disabled people as equal in value and dignity to all others. \n\nFor those not very familiar with the Paralympics, they are not about touchy feely inclusiveness.  These are world class athletes. They train just like Olympians.  This is serious sport and is about being the *best*.   Athletes times and scores are factored based on their individual disabilities, in order to create a level playing field as closely as possible, like the one able bodied athletes have by God's design.  The factors are necessary because athletes of different kinds and degrees of disabilities compete directly against one another.  Right now I'm watching seated biathlon, and most of the athletes have a factored time of 100%.  To get a factor below 100%, you would have to have a disability that directly and specifically  makes you slower on a sit ski. Since the athletes propel themselves with their arms by use of ski poles, having only one arm would qualify you for a lower factor.  One athlete with a factor of 100% has no thumbs and no muscles in her fingers. She has a custom made rifle to allow her to shoot. Since that disability is ameliorated by the rifle, her time factor is not reduced.\n\nTheoretically, I believe an able bodied athlete could even compete in some of the events, especially sitting events like this one. \n\nWhy is this pro-life?  Because the accomplishments of these athletes are as impressive as those of Olympic athletes. Paralympians' training is just as intense and their skills are just as honed as those of Olympians.  They are tremendous witnesses to the Truth that all lives have value, and are worthy of respect and dignity.\n\nSo if you like watching the Olympics, watch the Paralympics.  These are truly inspiring people.  The American who they just showed shooting is a double leg amputee and purple heart recipient.  He lost his legs in Afghanistan, and now he's wearing a different uniform for his country, skiing and shooting for a medal in Pyeongchang.  That's pro-life AF!\n\n"

She never pressed on me so I would join her church or anything like that: in fact, she always respected my option to say I was an atheist. However, I`d sometimes accompany her to masses, and we went for the WYD together (in Brazil, Jornada Mundial da Juventude), and I always saw how amazing the catholic church was: it just felt right!\nMy wish of becoming part of that became stronger, so in the beginning of 2017, as I passed in front of a parish near my home, there was a sign, which said there was a new Catechumenate class to begin soon. That where it all came to me: that was the call, and there was no way I could refuse that. So there I went, and after the entire year learning about our church, about our lord and savior Jesus Christ, here I am, a few hours away from my baptism and from my first communion. It will be held at a Saint Francis Xavier parish in Rio de Janeiro, at 6:30PM (GMT -3).\n\nIt`s so good to become a part of it all and be a true son of our God. I feel absolutely wonderful.

(amazing, for me).\n\n1. you can never know exactly what someone else feels, unless you're willing to put yourself out there and PRAY that they trust you enough to be honest about the way they feel. \n\n2. you can never change someone else, no matter how much you want to. even if you think that he's scared, or that he's waiting for the right moment, you cannot force him to come to grips with himself. that is, if there's even something for him to come to grips with. \n\nand FINALLY \n3. you can't be angry at someone for not loving you the way you love them. people are just people. boys are boys and girls are girls, and no matter what they do to you, there's no excuse for disrespecting someone else. especially if you say you love them. \n\n\nTL;DR-\nwe shouldnt be douchebags, even if the person we love is a douchebag. because that just makes a world of douchebags.\n\n"

This was probably the shortest period of either of those I have engaged in, and yet the most impactful. \n\nFrom using sources largely provided by contributors from this sub as well as /r/orthodoxchristianity, I have realized clearly that the Islamic belief about the Qur'an is incorrect. It has been altered and manipulated by men, with only hearsay to support it's claims otherwise. With this realization, comes my apostasy from Islam. In the religion, anyone who holds that opinion is automatically a kafir (infidel/disbeliever).\n\nA mere 6 hours after coming to that rather jarring realization came another, when the trinity clicked in my head. I didn't COMPREHEND the truth of the trinity, but I understood how it could be and moreover felt it was indeed this way.\n\nSo I want to say not only Thanks for the info, but... shoot. I guess I have to be a Christian now.\n\nThis is gonna be really messy in my life. But I have a strange feeling of happiness too.

The distrust of that institutional requirement, and the feeling that sex abuse proves they were right to distrust it, drives a lot of outrage most likely.\n> \n> The reality is that anywhere you have adults with authority over, and access to, kids, it happens. It's pretty obvious I think that people with those predilections would seek out those positions. Adding a religious component of loyalty and secrecy just ups the attractiveness of religious vocations to people who want that access. There's plenty of instances to be outraged about, apart from the Catholic Church, but people seem to be belatedly waking up to that fact now.\n\nI thought it was nice to see a reasonable response and reception within a community that is typically seen as hostile to the Church."

I have separated myself from the Church because I allowed my heart to be hardened against the Holy Father and the Church as it is in our time. I allowed myself, at an age where I should know better, to be 'radicalized' in a manner of speaking, by all kinds of things I either read or heard from other Catholics. \n\nThere is a huge amount of resistance to the Holy Father out there and I was fully dragged into that dynamic. Once you're in those circles and think that way, it perpetuates itself. Everything Pope Francis says is taken in the worst possible way, on the a priori assumption that the worst is probably true because it's Pope Francis. \n\nMy involvement in certain kinds of trad circles, which began before I was even baptised & confirmed, made me feel part of a parallel Church defined by resistance. Resistance to the Holy Father, resistance to the Second Vatican Council, resistance to everything modern. It got to the point where I was drunk on this narrative. I'd be at a High TLM, and even at the consecration - I'm ashamed to say - I'd be thinking not of Christ on the altar, nor of anything to do with Christ or the gosepl; but ''ha, us being here and doing this is really sticking it to the modernists''. \n\nEventually I burned out. Too much religion without spiruality, too much contempt and resentment for others, too much of that religious pride that doesn't even feel good. It's like a poision I was drinking. Eventually I came to the conclusion that if God had allowed the 'disaster' of Vatican II  to happen to the Church, then clearly it was not the Church of Christ at all. I flirted with the idea of becoming Orthodox. I flirted with the idea that perhaps God simply does not favour one institutional Church and therefore I shouldn't either - I was so burned out on religion that I was willing to half-believe that one just as the path of least resistance. Week after week, I didn't go to Mass. \n\nThings happened. I fell into sexual sin and heavy/frequent alcohol consumption. It was like a release valve had let everything out. \n\nMy father died last Wednesday which, though we had not always had a perfect or intimate relationship, put a lot of things into perspective. If all things are passing away, why had I been focused on tribalism and on externals, on pride and ego, more than on the Gospel? Matters of life and death made me feel these past few days like everything I believed before was silly, childish conceit. \n\nSomething told me yesterday morning to go online and watch some homilies of Pope Francis. I suddenly realised how little I'd actually done that, despite there being thousands available. In one of his homilies he said : *''please, if you feel far from God, draw close to your people, who will heal you from the ideologies which have cooled your fervor''* and these words resonated with me. I thought that I needed to go back to my original parish, to live my Catholicism there and not in the 'tradosphere', but to meet the people of the parish and encounter God in them. The more I listened to his homilies and speeches, the more I saw a man of the gospel, and the more I felt deeply ashamed for what I have thought and said against him. I saw the reflection of Christ in him and in his words. I know I've been pulling in the opposite direction to the Church and it's left no room for joy, or the gospel, in my heart. Having become Catholic, I had become 'more Catholic than the Pope' in record time. Prideful, toxic nonsense. \n\nNow, I want to make a full confession and come back into communion with the Church. I want to feel enthused by, rather than suspicious of, the Holy Father. I want to do my best to live his vision of Catholics witnessing to the gospel (by deed as well as word) on the peripheries. I want to embrace everything that is good about the modern Church\n\nAbove all, I want to accept that I know nothing about theology and ecclessiology and need to learn - from my shepherds, not from people with agendas. \n\nI won't judge people for receiving CITH\nI will try to accept people as acting in good faith even if we differ\nI will not commit the cardinal stupidity of resisting diversity of thought, praxis, style and tone in a Church that spans 232 different countries and all age groups.\n\nBasically, I want to come back and be a better person. And this time, I want to look to the Holy Father as the one to shepherd me along the way. His is a message of radical compassion and mercy in our encounters. It's my job to learn from that, because one thing I've learned is I am not equipped to question it. Doing so has just led me from Christ. \n\nI hope I can make a full confession today or tomorrow, start coming to Mass at my original parish again, and maybe even start going to School of Community again (talking to real Catholics of diverse backgrounds in real life, really helped - I guess I just wasn't ready to be helped). \n\nAnyway, God bless you all and I'm very sorry for the rambling post. \n\n\nEDIT: radical compassion not racial compassion\n"

            "value": "I was surprised with a trip to Hawaii in December.  It was from a guy I had dated ten years ago.  We had remained friends all those years, and now that we were both single, he wanted to see if we could reconnect.  It was all very romantic and sweet -- we lived in different cities and hadn't seen each other in the time between, but he did everything he could to make it perfect.\n\nWe went on the trip, and while we had that great friendship to base it off of, the romantic spark wasn't there.  So much so, that on the fourth morning of the trip, he explained to me that he was still in love with his ex.  I was hurt, but I didn't think it was going that direction anyway, so we parted ways and haven't spoken since.  It didn't break my heart, but it wasn't a great time.\n\nFast forward to last week.  I've been dating, I had a profile on OkCupid but took it down a few weeks ago because I just wasn't finding what I was looking for and I was kind of tired of looking.  For as long as I can remember I've browsed craigslist for fun, but I've mostly avoided dating from there -- it's just too sketchy in my experience.  While browing the m4w, I found an ad that I had to respond to, but not in any romantic sense.  I just had to share my story.\n\nThe ad was from a man about a year older than me.  His ad sounded a little crazy, but I could understand.  He was looking for someone different, someone he clicked with, that undeniable first time spark.  The ad read just a little too good to be true, and the kicker was that he wanted to take someone he barely knew, but felt he may have good chemistry with, to Hawaii.  To connect.  Sounded familiar.\n\nI couldn't help myself and sent him an email.  I wasn't answering the ad -- I took all of my PTO from work to take that trip (I took the rest of the time off of work, even though I wasn't in Hawaii after day four) and I'm a single mom.  There's no way I could take a trip like that again!  I really wanted to share my story with him and wish him better luck than I had.  I included a REALLY bad picture taken of me in Hawaii.  I never expected to hear from him.\n\nHis first email back was LONG.  He basically re-explained what he had said in his ad and asked me a lot of questions.  It was kind of as if he had the impression I was putting myself in the running for the trip.  He included a picture that wasn't exactly my type, but not HORRIBLE.  I responded and told him that there's no way I could do the trip with my circumstances, but at this point I have to admit I was intrigued.  His plan was just my brand of crazy and impetuous.  I have to admit, I probably would have ran with it if I could have.\n\nWe exchanged many more emails, and Thursday night he gave me his number and said he'd rather talk via phone or text at this point.  We had so much in common, and I really enjoyed what we were talking about during the chain of emails, so I called him immediately.  Yes, in hindsight, it was a total stalker move.  We talked for about an hour, and I let him go so I could go get something for dinner.  Before I could leave the house, he called me back and said he really enjoyed our conversation -- could he join me for dinner?  I figured why not, and we met.\n\nWhen he walked in the door, my first thought was to look around him for the guy I was meeting.  He was so damned handsome!  He vaguely resembled the picture he sent, but I only realized it was him when he smiled to see me.  We met at around 8:30, but we talked way more than we ate, and we didn't leave the restaurant until around midnight.  It was amazing, we had so much in common: interests, neighborhoods, music, beliefs...it was uncanny.  We went back to my house and talked on the couch until 2:00 a.m.  We discovered we shared the same birthday.  We also discovered we really liked kissing each other.  I finally had to kick him out so I could sleep.  We texted for at least another half hour after.\n\nThe next day, he brought me flowers and lunch at work.  I was so happy to see him...it was like I'd known him for years and just reconnected with him.  He asked me out Friday night to a local bar that features old video games, something we both enjoy.  We had a wonderful time, and he ended up staying over.  Every hour we spend together, we find something else we have in common, or find a difference we can laugh over.  I'm learning so much about him, but it still feels like I've known him forever.\n\nWe've decided to throw caution to the wind and see what happens if we forge a relationship.  He's taken his craigslist ad down (I just tried to find it to link here, it's gone) and I had taken my profiles down ages before.  I'm excited.  I dated casually for seven months, and not once did I find someone who interests me like this one.  He makes my tummy flutter every time I see him.  He's just as crazy about me as I am for him, and we can TALK.  \n\nI stopped looking, it found me.\n\nAnd I'm still not going to Hawaii, but I don't think he's going to be taking anybody either.  :)\n\nWish us luck, /r/love!"

She and I discovered a kind of love I had never experienced or imagined before, and finally ending it with her without looking back (we had broken up and gotten back together numerous times throughout 2010) was the hardest thing I ever had to. But I did it because the relationship had destroyed our individuality, we were both unhappy, and I'm glad I did it. It was the right thing to do.\n\nI've spent every day since then as a single man, investigating who I am and what makes me happy. I've worked harder on myself in the last year than I ever remember doing before. I got in shape, got a great job, learned how to organize my time, started reading a lot and writing in journals to organize and keep track of my thoughts, in general I've taken control of my life on a completely new level. I do everything I can to be an honest reflection of the person I want to be. This lifestyle makes me extremely content with my life, but I am more than content, for the last couple months, I have consistently been the happiest I have ever been in my life.\n\nI've been feeling this way because of the most important thing I've done in the last year- I started loving myself. I love the person I am and the person I want to be. I accept my strengths and my flaws, I trust myself completely, I approve of my own actions, and I do my best everyday to love myself and others as the people we are at the moment. I've been feeling the unconditional love for everyone and everything flowing out from me in every direction, and I came here to tell you all that I love you, and I'm so happy for you if you feel this same happiness because it is truly one of the beautiful things in life. If you are unhappy in any way, I wish you luck in learning to love yourself truly and honestly, because that is how true happiness is found. \n\nTL;DR I love you all so much"

I don't know her friends. \n\n5) If she sees USA on the envelope, she'll know it's from me. I want to keep it anonymous (whole \"no online relationship\" thing)\n\nSo, long story short, I want some ideas. I would love to be able to send her flowers or something, but that's probably out of the question. Does anyone know of something really nice and thoughtful that I could do?\n\n**TL;DR I met a super sweet girl online who is insecure about herself. I want to do something nice for VD for her.

She went into it thinking it was just a project she was going to help with, not knowing she was the center of it, and the meaning behind it all. It all happened in one take, and all of the reactions are real.\n\nShe was asked to hold these cards and flip them up on queue. A friend of theirs read the cards when they were flipped up.\n\nWhat follows is incredible. \n\nWhat my buddy, Alex Mercier, had to say about this: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get caught up and confused in life. Happiness is a simple thing, we just complicate it. I name of this song, \u2018goodbye\u2019, is ironic because it\u2019s NOT a goodbye to a lost love. It\u2019s a goodbye to the distractions and shiny things that ultimately prevent us from being happy. If you have people that care about you and you are given the opportunity to share yourself with them - Do it.\" \n\nHere is his description of the video, and their relationship:\n\n\"My sister introduced us 2 years ago, but we lived in different cities (She lived in Seattle, I lived in LA)\n\nWhen I found out she was moving to LA I told her there was an amazing room available\u2026 It was my room. I was gonna move out.  When she took it I conveniently hung around for a few days.  A week later were together and consolidated our things.  Everything was perfect for 6 months then tension started building.  We were living on top of each other and both of our work lives were creating a lot of stress.  I moved out in hopes that things would go back to normal.  It was a short lived success.  We weren\u2019t clicking.  So, we broke up officially, but were still very much in each others lives.  Her heart was broken.  I was very focused on work.  She ended up meeting someone else.  This was a shock and I was heartbroken.  You don\u2019t know what you have until it\u2019s gone.  Like a kick to the chest.  I made it clear that I wanted this to work between us and now was the time.  However, she was already involved with something else.  So, the Love triangle was created.  \n\nThen came the video. She\u2019s an actress and a model so I thought she would be willing to work on a project with me for my music.  She has always been supportive of this.  So she came down to the studio with virtually no idea what was planned.  We handed her some cards and gave her instructions to lift one at a time in front of the camera.  A friend read the cards back to us.  Her reactions were real, as it was our story.  \n\nI made the video because I had to see if we still meant something to her.  I thought if she was able to take a step back and look at the situation she might have a change of heart.  She\u2019s a tough cookie, so knew I had to go big or I didn\u2019t have a prayer!!  Also, beyond her and I, its a story worth telling.  I think it\u2019s relatable to a lot people.  The situation is not terribly unique, but that doesn\u2019t discount the impact.  Sometimes life can be great piece of art.\""

Tied up greasy hair, t-shirt, jeans and generic tennis shoes and from an Italian background, like me. I met her in Language Arts class. \n\nImmediately a friendly personality from her, so much so it was almost awkward. She became a good friend of mine, often helping each other with school work, spending time together during lunch outside or in the library. \n\nShe took to a liking to some British boy in that same class. This didn't bother me as I really was not attracted to her... *If anything I thought she was a little^ugly*. I even helped her build the self esteem and courage to talk to this person. \n\nOne day she did, it was a no. \n\nShe wasn't too bothered by this, life wen't on.\n\nHowever, I eventually started noticing, I would occasionally catch her staring or peeking. This hinted at something, but I suppose I just didn't care. Until one day. \n\nDuring the lunch break, she comes up to me and confesses her feelings towards me. *\"I've been gaining feelings for you for a long time now and I really wan't to tell you that I like you, is this mutual?\"*,  I won't lie, I was a little panicked. *I was not attracted to this person*. But I'm also a push-over. I really did not wan't to hurt her feelings, I know what rejection is like... \"Well why not?\" I thought. So I said they were. I don't know if this was a mistake. \n\nI will end it here since the point is to talk about love without initial attraction. If you wanna hear the rest, I will gladly write it, but its very saddening to me as it hurts me even now. \nGo ahead and make fun of \"highshool relationship\" and how cringe some of the things I wrote where, I completely understand. I was younger then, still developing the abilities for decision making. \n\nSo I wen't from completely un-attracted physically and emotionally to deeply in love and attached to this girl. What's ironic is when this relationship ended, she was the one to end it, not me. I was the one who ended up devastated. Even until this day, 2 and a half years later. \n\ntl:dr Love works in strange ways. Has anyone else experienced falling in love with a person they didn't even initially find attractive or even unattractive?\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEdit: So here is the rest. \n\nWhile still contemplating whether it was a mistake, she was incredibly happy to have some partnership, which in return made me happy. \n\nWith more and more time being put in, I grew happier and happier, the feeling of someone to talk to, someone to care about you and to care for, to spend time with, to be intimate with, to enjoy hobbies with or go out with. It definitely was not a mistake, at least I thought at the time. Seeing each other in the morning, in between classes, during class, lunch, after school, weekends. We were two peas in a pod to say the least. \n\nShe even fixed herself up at her own will, which really showed how she cared. We really got along and needless to say at this point, she was the most beautiful thing to me. \n\nOur parents even got along, both from same cultural background. I knew her family very well, I loved them to death and they showed the same back. Beautiful large family, which I don't have. I have but 1 parent, so it was new. \n\nIt must have been 6-7 months in. Never was happier and more motivated. Relationship was still going strong, absolutely no sign of what was going to happen. \n\nOne night, around midnight she messages me \"hey can we talk on skype\" completely out of the blue and by surprise. \n\nI have to say, I knew it. I knew what was going to happen, she never messages that seriously, let alone at midnight. I just didn't want to believe it, I blew it off as me being paranoid. But no, it happened. \n\nI hop on skype, she is there in a real serious tone. Something along the lines of  *\"Hey I wanted to talk to you about something, we really don't have much is common and I think we should break up, it's not you its me\"* basically a whole lot of sugar coating and reasons that were just not true. In the moment I just said *\"Whatever makes you happy\"*... \n\nShe thanked me for understanding, I hung up and she asked why, *\"There is nothing else to talk about\"*. \n\nI was in disbelief, at first I really just thought \"Oh she must just be going through emotional changes or something, she will be back apologizing\"  but little by little it got to me that night. Nope, she was serious. I don't know the reasoning till this day. \n\nMaybe she just stopped caring for me? Maybe it was the type of person I was growing up to be? It doesn't matter. I respect her decision and have accepted she was young, like I was and evolving both physically and emotionally. \n\nBut back then I didn't respect it, oh no, I was angry, depressed, confused and sick from it. I made a pathetic attempt to get back with her. I talked to her, watched her from a far, even stocked her on social media. I'm not proud of it, but I was heartbroken. Her reason for not trying again was that she might be moving. She never did. \n\nI tell you r/love, I'm not a person to cry much, but I never cried so hard over this person. Like full on screaming hard. It hurt me so much, I dropped out of school to do online last year. \n\n2 things that made me re-live the pain, enough to come on here to talk about it.  \n\n I had a vivid dream about being together and happy as I was then with her. \n\n A friend of mine, who still attended while I was homeschooling was told by her that she wanted to try again. 2 and a half years later he tells me this, now that I'm with someone new, which was crushing. \n\nYes, I'm with someone new too, a person I've known since I was 12. A person I'm incredibly close with and I intend to marry some day, about to be a year now. Yet this still haunts me. I'm still not over it. \n\nThis girl was my best friend, an ally, even now, I have nothing bad to say about this person. She still has a place in my my heart, soul and memory, always. \n\n\n"

            "value": "I\u2019d like to start by providing some background on myself; to grasp my point of view and then continue on to the very real story that inspired me  that there\u2019s still hope.\n\n\nMy name is Joey. I\u2019m a 23 year old psychology graduate from the university of Laurentian in Ontario.  After graduating I found struggles finding work in the intended career path I was pursuing, so currently i\u2019m working full time at a high-end suit store.   I\u2019m also an amateur comedian, whereas my job in this profession is to find inconsistencies in our daily lives and make jokes upon them.  I take aim at the concept of love quite frequently. \n\n\nThus the problem lies in time management; it seems where I feel the need to spend my time is to either to be working, writing jokes or netflixing with my cat, Sir Prrrington the 2nd.  I have resulted into downloading the infamous Tinder app in hopes on finding my lovely and pure Tinderella.  Honestly it works.  I make connections with women all the time, but thats just the problem.  My love life has turned into a scene from \u2018Keys To the VIP\u2019 (Tinder addition).  I\u2019m at a buffet, where i\u2019m enthralled by all the choices, paralyzed by the multiplicity of swipes and pretty faces.  And I ask myself, why can\u2019t I just settle??? What makes it so hard to commit???\n\n \nAnd thus I conclude that its the thrill, the mystery, the manipulation of how many \u2018trophies\u2019 I could get.               but my douchebagery doesn\u2019t just stop there.  It\u2019s also MY insecurities: the fear that after a while MY CONS will out weigh my pros-    that after a while my annoying tendencies will just become a weight on someone else\u2019 shoulders-    that I\u2019m not a full person who cant commit fully to another because I'm not strong enough to deal with the anxiety that is attached with the label of \u2018boyfriend\u2019.  \n\n\n*Chymes in the story of someone I truly admire. \n\n\n\nPaul, my dad, stands at 5\u20196, 200 pounds of pure awkward and introverted goofyness. His english isn\u2019t strong as he is a FOB from Italy.  He\u2019s a character who would trip on his own two feet while dancing and ask if his partner was okay.  Not a strong conversationalist by any means and prefers his nights with his wife-    and when available his 4 kids.  He doesn\u2019t have many friends and only has one treasure on this planet- his wife.\n\n\nTomorrow is my mothers birthday.  She and my father will have been married for 30+ years.  \n  \n\nAs a typical man would, he went shopping for a present for my mom the day before her birthday.  \n\n\nHe requested I\u2019d come help him shop for morale support. \n\n\nSo, being curious I asked him, \u201cWhat are you planning on getting mom?\u201d\n\n\nand in his very timid and unsure response, he said \u201cI\u2019m not sure, something as beautiful as she is, maybe a victorian styled mirror\u201d\n\n\n\nI cringed and turned away from the dad-joke, addressing the line with satirical laughter\u2026  but to him it wasn\u2019t a joke.  He was perplexed by my laugh and was fully sincere in his statement.  He decided that jewellery to match a dress my mom had had bought for an up coming wedding was the perfect surprise.  He forced me into 8 different jewelry stores not knowing exactly what was the right jewel for my mom.  \nAnd, i kept asking him, what are we looking for? Is it a ring? Is it earrings?? Is it a necklace???\n\n\nAnd he said, \u201c I\u2019m not sure.  Your mom is one of a kind.  I want the biggest and best gem, and the strongest and whitest of golds to match the smile I see when i give it to her.\u201d  \n\nMy spiderman senses started to kick in, I stated to look at his proud stature, his manic mannerisms and the radiant energy that he was putting off in the moment\u2026  his feet were rumbling, his teeth were chattering his face glowing\u2026 \n\n\nTo all the jewellers he was ecstatic, more than usual his words were flustered and boggled\u2026 He needed it to be the right colour, the right quality, the right set to match the dress and of course the right price, I mean he\u2019s Italian\u2026 he\u2019s a cheap guy\u2026 \n\nHe triple checked like 6 of the stores for price and comparison making headaches for myself and the other jewellers involved.  With every article of jewellery he asked,\n\n\u201cWell what do you think she\u2019d like this one over the last?\u201d \n\nHe became anxious\u2026 unknowing\u2026 completely vulnerable that he didn\u2019t have the right resources or        knew how to say the right words to portray what he wanted.  \n\nWe took pictures and videos, measurements and colour palates, jeweller cards and coffee breaks.\n\n\n\nWe deemed it a viable option to then send our findings (pictures of the items) via the technologies to my sister where she ridiculed our choices and told us that SHEE would just go out and buy the gift for my dad. (PLOT TWIST WHOAHHHH) \n\nThus, victory! \n\nAyyyyyyy now I get it, my dad in this story isn't the true picker of the present but that simply isn't the point.  \n\n\n\nThe most vitality in a persons face comes out when they are talking about something they're truly passionate about.  My dad, a true romantic lights ups when ever he talks about my mom, as limited his vocab maybe.  After 30+ years to have that excitement for someone is mystifying to me.  I haven\u2019t had that yet in my life but it leaves me optimistic that\u2026 -   that experience hasn\u2019t YET happened to me\u2026 that with all the technology in the world there is little left in life that is a mystery\u2026\n\n but to all those romantics out there\u2026 and to myself\u2026\n\nLove is possible and worth striving for\u2026 if anything it is the one connection that makes us fully complete.  It\u2019s not based on facts or structure but the willingness to show your weaknesses and vulnerability with another person. \n\n The madness of love is the greatest of heavens blessings. - Plato \n\nThanks for reading, I hope this put a smile on people\u2019s face and gives you hope into new horizons.\n\n@coolstoryjoee"

It's a very long read but I think it's important and I agree with it for the most part.\n\nPart 1\n\n\"A lot of people ask me what my biggest fear is, or what scares me most. And I know they expect an answer like heights, or closed spaces, or people dressed like animals, but how do I tell them that when I was 17 I took a class called Relationships For Life and I learned that most people fall out of love for the same reasons they fell in it. That their lover\u2019s once endearing stubbornness has now become refusal to compromise and their one track mind is now immaturity and their bad habits that you once adored is now money down the drain. Their spontaneity becomes reckless and irresponsible and their feet up on your dash is no longer sexy, just another distraction in your busy life. Nothing saddens and scares me like the thought that I can become ugly to someone who once thought all the stars were in my eyes.\"\n\nPart 2\n\n\"I never expected this to be my most popular poem out of the hundreds I\u2019ve written. I was extremely bitter and sad when I wrote this and I left out the most beautiful part of that class. \nAfter my teacher introduced us to this theory, she asked us, \u201cis love a feeling? Or is it a choice?\u201d We were all a bunch of teenagers. Naturally we said it was a feeling. She said that if we clung to that belief, we\u2019d never have a lasting relationship of any sort. \nShe made us interview a dozen adults who were or had been married and we asked them about their marriages and why it lasted or why it failed. At the end, I asked every single person if love was an emotion or a choice. \nEverybody said that it was a choice. It was a conscious commitment. It was something you choose to make work every day with a person who has chosen the same thing. They all said that at one point in their marriage, the \u201cfeeling of love\u201d had vanished or faded and they weren\u2019t happy. They said feelings are always changing and you cannot build something that will last on such a shaky foundation.\nThe married ones said that when things were bad, they chose to open the communication, chose to identify what broke and how to fix it, and chose to recreate something worth falling in love with. \nThe divorced ones said they chose to walk away. \nEver since that class, since that project, I never looked at relationships the same way. I understood why arranged marriages were successful. I discovered the difference in feelings and commitments. I\u2019ve never gone for the person who makes my heart flutter or my head spin. I\u2019ve chosen the people who were committed to choosing me, dedicated to finding something to adore even on the ugliest days. \nI no longer fear the day someone who swore I was their universe can no longer see the stars in my eyes as long as they still choose to look until they find them again.\""

She was pacing the sidewalk. I didn't want to walk by her so I tried to cross the street farther up, but it was awkward so I decided to walk past her. As I came behind her I said \"Coming up behind you\" since she was in the middle of the sidewalk. She asked if I worked at PP, and I told her that I was there for STD testing.\n\nShe looked concerned, asked about my health, and was super sweet. I said I'm pro-life and went to Catholic school and all that. She asked if I had gone elsewhere for testing and I said yes, but my current situation was just ambiguous.  \n\nI told her that since I contracted an STD this past spring that I've had my doubts about God and my faith. She told me that God and Jesus are always with me, no matter what.\n\nShe offered to pray with me. So on the sidewalk, next to one of the busiest roads in my town, she laid her hand on my shoulder and offered a prayer for my health, my education and future. We prayed an Our Father together.\n\nIt was drizzling and she even offered to drive me back to my apartment. I declined, because I need the exercise.\n\nIt was great.

When all you feel is pain and you've known that they arent going to ever truly love you at all. But they've been the fantasy you have always dreamed of. Is that choosing trajedy? Do i secretely want to not be able to control my tears at any moment? All i have ever wanted was to feel love. Good strong true love. I have it and am fully capable of it but i dont know if i can ever let myself find it. I have given up following insanely promising chances, of my own accord and for myself, and i have nothing.

I remember looking at your pictures and saying \"Hm, she's kind of cute.\" in the most normal of ways. I had no clue then that I was talking to the most beautiful, most interesting, funniest person I'd know. We had our first conversation that night and my life has never, ever been the same, and I have never, ever gone a day without thinking of you. A conversation that was full of sarcasm, wit, commonality, and that I'll never forget. \n\nI'll skip ahead a little, to the day we first hung out. I admit that we could've seen each other earlier that week, but I was so afraid of saying or doing the wrong thing, of not living up to some standard, to not keeping that chemistry going. Not only was I wrong, but all the things that we enjoyed about each other were amplified and the chemistry was stronger that I could've imagined. \n\nThe time that we had together was truly the greatest point in my life, all of it. Laying against me on a park bench, staring out at the stars, and me telling you to come back to me at the exact moment you started to drift. Going out for a beer and a burger. You, half on my lap, with your beautiful necklace swinging in my face, with a way of honestly looking at me that I've never seen before. Even the time away from each other was not in vain, because it reinforced how no one could ever fill the void that you left. \n\nToday is your birthday. I don't know if you'll read this, but I just wanted to put out there how truly lucky I am to have had you in my life. I still think about you every waking day, I still love you more than you will ever know, and I wish you nothing but the best. "

Every breath is somehow more intense and radically different. Every one before you is somehow a pointer that lead me to you. All without you is a waste. \n\nThough it's hard, I trust you. With every part of me, and you know and accept me in my entirety. Something I couldn't imagine anyone doing. \n\nBut it's the little things now, the light catching in your eyes, the way you hold me, how I feel in your arms. Dumb jokes, knowing looks, your little smirks and how when you laugh you just lose yourself in the moment. The little things that keep me falling for you even when I've thought I was in as deep as I could possible go. \n\nHow you appreciate music, feel it rather than listen to it, just as I do. \n\nI feel as though I'm tied to you, something to anchor me in this huge world where it's so easy to lose yourself.

Nonetheless, how I feel is how I feel, and I don\u2019t shy away from the lesser parts of myself. After all, I have to be well familiar with something to recognize it as a flaw and begin to change it. Although I still wish with all that I am that I didn\u2019t feel this way. \n\nSince the first time we spent time together, you\u2019ve never been anything less than an immense part of my life. We said \u201cI love you\u201d after a mere 2 \u00bd months, and things moved incredibly quickly. Moments shared with you were unlike anything I\u2019ve ever experienced. To this day, I\u2019m still not convinced anyone knows me as well as you do. Or, I guess, did. While I\u2019d love to forget what made me love you, I also don\u2019t want to. There are some moments we shared (you know the ones) that I felt so unbelievably loved and close to you. At times, we were on top of the world. At this point in my life, I truly can\u2019t imagine sharing that connection with anyone else. I definitely haven\u2019t come anywhere near that since the breakup. \n\nOf course, our relationship wasn\u2019t without flaws, on both sides. (Man, 3 months after breaking up and it still feels strange to talk about our relationship in the past tense). You acted a bit young and our relationship fell short in terms of some formalities, and that definitely got to me. Although I was just as bad. I\u2019m still kicking myself for the way I unintentionally distanced myself from your friends \u2013 who, by the way, I still like more than anyone I\u2019ve met here; you know some really, really genuine people. I was so caught up in trying not to do the wrong thing with them that I came off as boring and uninterested. I also was too much within our relationship to realize that I was suffocating you. My behavior would\u2019ve been appropriate for an older couple, but you\u2019re right to want to enjoy your twenties. \n\nBefore the breakup, we talked about the possibility of taking a break, but decided that it would just prolong the inevitable. Although, as it turns out, a break is just what I needed. I feel as though I could come back into this relationship and a lot of our problems just won\u2019t be problems anymore. I\u2019ve learned a lot this summer. I am so unbelievably ready to leap back into this with a renewed sense of what is important and what I need to slow down on. I am ready to sleep in your arms, a blanket of comfort, warmth, and happiness over me once again. I am ready to stare into your eyes and see you again, see all of you. I want to come home to you \u2013 you really do still feel like home to me. \n\nBut somehow, that\u2019s not what you want. And it becomes hard to breathe when I remember that. You. Don\u2019t. Want. Me. I am not enough for you, what I can offer is not enough for you. And I have to tell you, it really sucks being so unbelievably head over heels for someone and not having them think twice about you anymore. \u201cReally sucks\u201d being the understatement of the century. \n\nPeople debate on whether unreciprocated love is romantic or just pathetic. I gotta tell you, I\u2019m quite certain that there\u2019s nothing romantic about getting so stoned that you fall asleep, waking up, and doing it again and again because you can\u2019t bear to be alone with your thoughts. Because, then the thing where you can\u2019t breathe begins to happen again. \n\nI\u2019d send this to you if I thought you cared about any of this anymore. I\u2019d send this to you if you weren\u2019t with her already. But you are, and there\u2019s nothing to be gained from you knowing this letter even exists. \n"

After making small talk many of them asked how long I had been part of the parish. Nervously and with complete honesty I mentioned the very short time frame I had been attending and the fact that I was previously atheist trying to find my way with the Lord.\n\nTo my shock they all welcomed me with open arms. A couple regaled me with their stories of how they once too had \"a falling out with the Lord\" but found their ways back to the flock.\n\nA younger lady actually beckoned the priest, without me asking, so that he could greet me and hear my story. He was very understanding and offered to do whatever was necessary to help me become a baptized, confirmed Catholic. He acknowledged it must have been difficult for me to speak to others considering that I was coming from an atheistic viewpoint but commended me for my bravery. He assured me of their being no reason to be nervous or embarrassed as the Lord accepts us all if we make the effort to seek him and live alongside him.\n\nI just figured I'd share this story. Thanks again to all the advice offered. It's now time that I begin learning the catechisms so that I can make the step towards confirmation.\n\n\n"

How she didn't realize it until I told her years before how I felt towards her. It didn't work then, and I moved on. But that place in my heart for her never left. We remained really close after that. Tonight, she asked me \"do you think you feel the same way about me as you once did? Cause I think I might feel that way back.\"\n\nWe have not ceased talking and freaking out together since that moment. We were meant to be this. 4 years we have grown together. Learned and taught eachother. And though at one point I felt ashamed and sad about feeling how I did, and moving on, i realize now without that step; that bump in the road, we would have never made both our dreams come true.\n\nKeep trying. Never hide your feelings. It's better to fail everytime than to never try at all. With each failure you have with a person, you learn. And you become smarter and smarter.

She was the definition of petite, standing at only 5'2\" with a very slender figure and light brown hair. She also had little the cutest puffy cheeks and incredibly adorable freckles. but the feature that i adored the most was her deep, soul full eyes. She was incredibly shy but also very kind and compassionate as well. Unfortunately we both went to a high school that was rife with assholes, so sadly she got picked on a lot by girls and guys because she was considered an outsider, as well she was teased a lot because of her diminutive stature and for her relatively flat chest, mostly by other girls but also by guys as well (i will never understand why people can be so cruel to others. and quite frankly, I don't really want to know). I was bullied many a time as well for my appearance. I was 6'3\", 215lbs, had shoulder length jet black hair, and dressed mainly in metal band shirts, combat boots/camo pants, and even wore a black trench coat, so it was inevitable that i was looked upon as a school shooter ([thanks Reb and VoDKa!](http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/archive/2004/04/1_123125_123075_2094298_2098145_2099207_040420_columbine.jpg.CROP.promo-mediumlarge.jpg)) Hell, one girl flat out referred to me as \"that Dylan Klebold kid\". Naturally I was very sympathetic to her plight, so i always made sure that i did little things for her like holding open doors for her, saying hello to her in the hallways, and just generally treating her as nicely as i could to try and combat the constant venom being spat at her by the popular crowd. Every time i did this she would let out an incredibly cute appreciative smile that always made me feel very warm and fuzzy inside.\n\n\nOne winter Friday Elise was getting ready to walk home, and she had just the saddest, loneliest look on her face that absolutely tore my heart out. I knew that i wouldn't be able to live with myself if i didn't do anything to try and help, so i grabbed my shit, exited out the side entrance and offered to walk home with her, despite the fact that she lived the complete opposite way that i did (she lived east of the school and i lived west of it). Almost immediately her face lit up and she instantly said yes please. We began walking to her place and started out with just small talk (we were in English class together so we started talking about the upcoming Hamlet book report that was due next week, but it morphed into discussion about other school classes and eventually life outside of school). Eventually Elise said \"thank you so much for all the nice things you do and say to me. It really means a lot to me.\" At this point i told her that i knew all to well what it was like to be picked on, and i simply wanted to make her feel better. Elise let out an incredibly cute smile and again i felt the temperature in my soul go up a couple degrees (Celsius, as we live in Canada after all.) About half way to her home i noticed Elise was shivering a lot. Shortly after she told me in her little mousy voice that she was cold. After she said that, I took off my trench coat and wrapped it around her. Now imagine, this cute, petite girl wearing a black trench coat that was many sizes too big for her tiny frame. She smiled and thanked me for what i did. I quipped \"i know it was made more for King Kong than for Pikachu, but hopefully it'll do the trick.\" After i said this, her face lit up bright red and she let out the cutest, most heart-warming giggle that I ever heard. Of course this left me in nothing more than my Rammstein shirt when it was cold as balls outside, but i did not give a single flying fuck. The warmth i felt inside was more than  sufficient enough to compensate for the coldness outside.\n\n\nWe finally make it to her house and before we parted Elise gave me my trench coat back, looked up at me and said \"thank you soooooo much for walking with me. I am really grateful that you did this and i hope we get to do it again.\" \"As do I\" was my reply. We hugged for a good five minutes (or so it seemed) before she walked up the steps to her home. Shortly before she walked inside, she turned around and blew me a kiss while i waved her good bye. Once she made it inside I turned around and started making my way back to my home. I was half way back to my home when i started kicking myself for not asking for her number and possibly asking her out for a date. Not a big problem, i'll see her again next week was what i told myself. Well one week passes and i did not see her even once that week. When school was dismissed for the weekend i decided to walk by her house and she how she was doing. When i arrived there i saw something that made my heart completely sink. Right there on the front lawn was a big for sale sign. I took a peak inside, still holding out all hopes that she was still there, but all i saw was an empty room that once was their living room. Feeling completely crushed, i went home with sorrow in my heart and tears in my eyes. I really, really liked Elise, and all i had thought about that week was seeing her again. But now i would never, ever, see her again. She was the first, and only girl who treated me with any kind of affection. It took me a long time for me to come to terms with this fact.\n\n\nFast-forward to a few hours earlier today, almost exactly five years later. Here i am, still kissless, still dateless, and still otherwise completely devoid of any kind of romantic emotions. I am at work taking my lunch break at a nearby Tim Horton's (how stereotypically Canadian) when i hear a familiar voice. I look in the direction of the voice and i saw a face that i thought i had recognized before but couldn't put my finger on it. I receive my BLT and double-double and go to sit down when all the sudden i heard the same voice say \"Bladeovcain, is that you?!\" It had finally dawned on me. It was Elise. I could not believe it, and i still can't even now as i write this. She has hardly changed at all since that day. She is still every bit as cute as i remember, perhaps even more so now. We hugged each other and sat down with our lunches. We started talking about our lives. As it turns out she is in University working towards obtaining a bachelors degree in business, and is working towards becoming an accountant. I told her that i'm currently a second year pipe-fitter looking to go back to school to become a third year before the year is done. She also told me that she has her own place just off campus. After more small talk, i was beginning to have the feelings that i felt for her previously all come back to me, and i was on cloud 9. Towards the end of our lunch break, she reminisced about the walk we had together, as well as all the other things i did for her in high school. She said that that was, and still is, the greatest memory in her life. I asked her why she moved. She replied that the bullying simply got to be so much that she had to get the fuck out of there. She then proceeded to tell me that she cried for three weeks straight afterwards because she thought she would never see me again. Now the warmness in my soul has returned once again.\n\n\nAs we were wrapping up our lunch breaks, Elise said that she was so happy to see me again. I may have been given a second chance at redemption. I asked her if she was single still. \"Yes i am. I still haven't been on a date with anyone.\" Now it dawned on me. I have indeed been handed a second chance. Time to rectify the situation. I asked Elise if she wanted to get together again. I hardly finished the question when she instantly said yes. We exchanged phone numbers, hugged again, and went our separate ways. The euphoria of knowing that she is back in my life is the greatest feeling i have ever felt. I now sit here writing this while texting Elise to set up our date night for tonight. I can't believe that this is actually happening right now. I am seriously the happiest motherfucker alive right now.\n\n\nTL;DR: Was nice to really cute girl who was bullied constantly. Walked her home one winter day. She moved because she couldn't take the bullying anymore. Was devastated. Met her on my lunch break five years later. Asked her out. She said yes. Now we're seeing the late show for The Revenant in what is my, and her, first date ever."

And the question is not why Pope Francis is so unpopular with conservative catholics (even if he's working really hard to finish B16 work to reach full communion with SSPX, after JP2 shut down the doors), but why, specifically in USA, some part of catholic media and catholic clergy (who, let's remember, made some of the biggest mistakes in church ever) seems to have moven war to him in Day one.\n\nIs for the catholic social teachings? Is because the southern america vision is so different from the north-american one and european, but with the second is more compatible?\n\nThe most interesting fact is that Dolan and other American cardinals are considered by most of the vaticanists (journalists that work at the Vatican) some of the real kingmakers that wanted to elect him...\n\nI'm a catholic journalist and i read Popes' speeches and documents daily. And I think Pope Benedict was even more social oriented than Francis: the \"Caritas in Veritate\" is the catholic version of the \"Occupy Wall Street\", and more progressive than the Leo XIII's \"Rerum Novarum\" was in 1891.\n\nNo offence, guys.\nI really want to know why.\nFor us, Italian Catholics, Pope Francis has been a blessing. We had in these years a boost in vocations, attendance and positive image for the Church, who can now speak more loudly in a lot of aspects of public life."

This was seriously the month I didn't think it would happen. For why, see this post I made in [r/tryingforababy](http://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/comments/36qul5/bfp_and_a_breakdown_we_conceived_on_mothers_day/)\n\nI am floored, shocked, and this all seems very surreal. God is wonderful. I can't help but think that all of the prayers prayed on my behalf this month made a difference.\n\nWhat a wonderful blessing this is! I have never felt so happy in my life.

I have some wonderful news to share! \n\nContext: I posted [this](https://ud.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/85twj9/today_i_am_telling_my_extremely_anticatholic/?ref=share&ref_source=link) on Tuesday around 10 hours before I shared the news of my Confirmation into the Catholic Church with my Southern Baptist parents.\n\nUPDATE: On Tuesday night, I told my parents verbatim: \n\n> \"I need to tell you something that I think is going to be upsetting for you. I want to start off by saying that I love y'all (yes, I live in the American South), I love Christ, and I love the way y'all raised me to have an unwavering faith in Him. Over the last several years, I started to grow spiritually around more Catholics, and realized the Holy Spirit was pulling me towards the Church, so much so that I am joining at Easter.\n\n> You won't see much change in my behavior. I'm still going to keep the Commandments, believe and share Christ's love for His people, and worship our living Savior.\n\n> I know you'll have doubts,and I'm not asking you to agree with me, but I really want to keep the doors open between us spiritually.\"\n\nI know it was verbatim because I practiced it over 25 times. Also, I want to extend a special thanks to /u/rawketscience for drafting this message for me. I owe you, brother.\n\nMy parents responded in the most caring, accepting way I could imagine! They looked at each other for a few seconds and then my father said, \"Thank you for letting us know. We kinda knew it was coming. You know that I love you and trust your judgement.\" My heart was struck with a wave of relief.\n\nI reassured them that I am willing to answer any questions/concerns they have at anytime in the future. And I also thanked them again for instilling such an incredible biblical foundation during my childhood.\n\nMy mother was gracious, smiled, and said \"Son, I love you more than you will ever know and I know you are confident in your choice.\"\n\n\nSo there it is!\n\nI owe so so many of you a hug and a thank you for your prayers, advise, and kind words. I will do my best to read and respond to all of your messages. I love this community.\n\nALSO!!! I had my first confession last night! Next sacrament (and the one I've been longing for for 5 years) is NINE DAYS AWAY! God bless you all :) "

Where had it all gone wrong?\n\nPilate trying to find an excuse not to condemn Jesus, but finally giving into the crowd.\n\nHerod, expecting the Messiah he had heard so much about, being disappointed and angry about this miserable, scourged, ruined man.\n\nAfter Confirmation and my first Eucharist (eating at the grown-up table, yay!), I got to imagine the utter joy in Heaven, dismay in Hell, and shock (to some) and joy (to others) on Earth as it became apparent that deeper plans were at work.\n\nSorry to ramble on, but all of this is to end up in joyful expectation of what deep plans our Lord has for me.\n\nBTW, my saint name is Nicholas.

But anyways let me get started.\n\nSo it was about three years ago, it was the beginning of summer i was skateboarding with some friends, I noticed my friend witch we called matsa was texting someone so I asked who it was. Yes i was a bit nosy back then, but she responded with jade. And i just fell in love with the name. So joking around i said tell her I said hi and she did so she said hi back and told me to text her sometime. So I got her number from matsa and finished the day of, I went home and texted her for the first time. We got along just fabulously she was kind, smart, beautiful and just all around a lovely person. So the summer went by and we kept talking and talking and we found that we had a lot in common, well after that it was the same throughout the school year. So summer came again and by then we were the best of friends we'd always be texting and talking but we never met. So I believe it was about midsummer when I was playing MW2 I started to become a gamer, anyways as usual we were talking and she said i'm in love. me by then was completely madly in love with her. So me thinking it was someone else but not wanting to tell her said \"oh?\" \"with who?\" and she responded \"with you\". I felt such excitement such joy so much love i started to cry. But it was only then that I remembered we were moving away to mexico. So I asked my mom if she would take me to see her before we did and she said this to me when we arrived to mexico, she said she saw such depression and love in my eyes she couldn't say no. so one week before we left we drove to her house so we could see each other for the first time ever. And it was like heaven on earth we kissed so passionately when our lips first touched I swear my knees gave out and when we hugged neither of us let the other go for about 15 minutes. I never wanted it to end I just wanted to hold her in my arms forever and ever. But the day came to the end, a week went by and it was 2 days before we left and my mom said \"i'm going up north if you'd like I can drop you of at jade's house\" of course I said yes. So when i arrived her mom and brother were gone, and my mom left so we went in her room started to watch a movie. Well we started kissing and one thing led to another and well we made passionate love. We were young and in love, When it was time for me to go I remember we were standing at her door holding each other and she started to cry. I kissed her on the forehead and said don't cry i love you we'll be together again someday, she hugged me so tight and i her. I got in the car and drove of and started to cry. My mom stopped the car and said go say the last goodbye. As soon as jade saw me get out of the car she ran towards me and I to her. We kissed and cried and finally said goodbye. \nNow that im in mexico we talk via text message since she's never really online and i just miss her it's been three years and i just havent moved on or thought about dating, i just cant i love jade i hope we can be together some day again.\nI love you jade.\nAnd i just needed to tell someone my story thank you reddit! for listening."

I guess this makes me a predictable guy, but I seem to go for the idea of a woman with a kind heart, who could use some help. If an actress is good at portraying emotional pain, I tend to relate somehow, and sympathize with them at a level that can't be healthy. I daydream in detail about how I'd try to make them feel better, and hopefully help them to be happier. \n\nAnyway, sorry to ramble. I just wondered if any of you can relate. I feel maybe I am a bit screwed up at the moment. I am with someone I love, but who is a  bit cold. I guess it's nice to imagine being needed, and to give away more of myself."

I'm super glad I did text him and thank you kind redditor!\n\nI never thought I would ever be in love, honestly. He's been making a huge impact on my life, most of all we bond over music and movies. He would recommend me movies and I would watch them, texting about it afterwards. To which he replied that he would rather we watch movies together and I feel the same. I'm glad I found someone like him and he's the first guy I truly feel this way.\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much for the kind comments!! I think I am lucky indeed and thankful, for had I not done all these things that put me out of comfort zone I don't think we'd have met. I don't know about him, but I fell in love from the day I first saw him at a meeting. Then it became even deeper when we hung out and talked more. :)"

So was the sweetest most beautiful person I had meet and I wanted to ask her out but I refrained from doing so. The reason why I did that is because we were only 4 months from graduation and she was going to the university of Alabama. It was a college out of state that I had no intention of going nor did I have the cash to do so. At that moment I had to savor every last moment with her. At times we did stuff together just the two of us and had a blast, and when prom came around I didn't even hesitate to plan a promposal. I even wrote a song just for her. I really wanted to be something more with this girl but I felt like a dick if I asked her out days before graduation. I didn't want to ruin her dreams and give her a reason not to go to her dream university so I did nothing and said my good byes at graduation. Now it's been seven months and I still think of her. She was the light of my world and I let her slip through my fingers. I only wish I said something to let me know if she felt the same way about me, and at times I think I stood out more than the other guys she dated. Some days I lay awake at night hoping she would come back, but I know that won't happen. She's gone and I need to let go."

Love tends to be filled with satisfying lies and unsatisfying truths. But we still praise it. Cherish each second our existence is bypassed by that smile, by that look, by that voice, that blush, that fear, that emotion, that joke, that fight, that anger, that apology, that... Love. It is deeply frustrating how the application of the term has so many unknown variables and so many questions and possibilities, yet its definition is self-sufficient. Love is love. It is the image on the cover of a puzzle box. You know the shape, the colors, but the pieces are so tricky, so stubborn, so senseless when analysed alone. You may stare at a pitch black piece trying desperately to make some sense out of it... And failing to understand that you were staring at the black spot on the wing of a butterfly. It still lacks a definition... But it never lacks shape. \nSo look for it. Look paciently for that stupid hilarious joke and that unthinkable brilliant idea, that calm smile and that furious look. You may not be the first one to fall for them, you may not be the first one to praise them; but keep in mind that all fireworks are lit by the same fire, yet no two explosions of color are the same. Find it, and let it consume you. You won't have to align it with you messed up definition of love, because that person will become your definition of love.\n"

When you first get together you can't get enough of each other. To be in love is like nothing else in the world. The visions of the future, the hope, the possibilies feel endless. Sharing life with another even after the initial love sickness settles is another treasure in life. To be able to give to a partner, to take care of them when they aren't feeling well, to reminisce in on old times. You would do anything to see a smile upon their face again. The warmth of a home made by the union of two (for some more) people. Cooking together, taking baths together or getting dirty in the garden together. The simple thing shared with another you love are even sweeter. Eventually in all cases love is lost. They might catch another's eye or you too may disagree too often, the love you felt may just fade and interest becomes lost. Eventually all love of not ended by a fight or another lover will end (as far as we know it) by the final rest we call death. The loss of a lover is like no experience on earth. You may not eat or you may eat too much. You may not sleep or you may sleep to avoid being awake. Things that were once fond memories may become triggers of agony. You might just cry until you have no tears left to shed. You may think you will never love again. But you just might. Love comes and love goes. Though in some ways love is never lost. I still have a deep love for the lovers who truly touched my heart. Once the pain fades the memory of love can return. You may not see them ever again but you may still have a special place in your heart for them. Love touches us deeply moves us to try new things and step out of our comfort zone. Love is a garden we grow with another. We can choose to keep it well watered and fertilized or you can let it grow weeds and wilt. Even if your garden is lost their will almost always be another plot to till or lawn to convert.\n\n\nTLDR love is beautiful love is painful is it worth it? Definitely!\u00a0\n\nI know this was probably just a jumble of ideas but thanks for giving me a venue for letting it out.\u00a0"

There\u2019s this one quote that I found a while ago that sums up how I feel right now.\n\n\u201cHe was a major part of your life; of course you\u2019ll miss him; it\u2019s perfectly normal.

It\u2019s going to take a while, but it always takes some time. Should you have kept the tooth? No, because it was causing you pain. Pulling the tooth was the right decision, but it\u2019s still going to hurt.\u201d\n\nThis is how I feel about us. At one point you felt so right in my life. You were a tooth to me. You were part of me that helped me get through my day, chewing my food and what not, but at some point you came loose. When a tooth comes loose there really is only one thing to do. Pull it out. But as the days passed where you were out of my life it felt like a missing tooth. There was gap in my life that you once filled. So I did the only sensible thing and tried to put you back in my life. The problem with that is that, when you try to put a tooth you pulled out back in, it\u2019ll stay for a little, but then fall out again because in the end it\u2019s no longer part of you.  And that\u2019s what I tried to do. Put you back in. That putting the tooth I pulled out back in would put things back to normal, but the truth is it doesn\u2019t. Once you pull a tooth out, it\u2019s no longer part of the body, and it stops growing. \n\nI miss you so much you have no idea. I wake up day after day and you\u2019re the first thing that comes to mind, and with the thought of you comes the pain of not having you around. I dream constantly about you too. In one of my dreams you told me you were pregnant and I was mind fucked because I never remembered us having sex, but apparently we did. All I did was hold you and tell you I\u2019d be there for you. When I woke up from that one I couldn\u2019t get out of bed for a while. \n\nBut in the end it\u2019s called a break up because it\u2019s broken, and I haven\u2019t seen that until now. I\u2019ve been so na\u00efve and short sighted in thinking that if we\u2019re together we\u2019ll both be happy to see that no matter how much I try to fix something as broken as us, I can\u2019t. I pulled you out of my life, so I should have stayed out of yours. For that I\u2019m sorry. I really am.\n\nI hope that if this letter ever gets to you, that you know it\u2019s from the heart.\n\nFor the past two years you\u2019ve helped me through so many hard times and through so many good ones. You\u2019ll always be a part of me that I\u2019ll never forget. I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019ve tried to put you back in to my life so many times. I should\u2019ve seen that it would just end in heartbreak, but I only saw that something was missing instead of seeing that it\u2019s gone for a reason. I\u2019m sorry that I convinced you to come back thinking that everything would work out each time, but I see now how bad I am for you. \n\nI hope that one day you\u2019ll say hi to me and that we can talk about how we\u2019ve been and that I can clear up anything I\u2019ve confused you about. \n\nLife goes on and we have to go along with it. That\u2019s something that I\u2019m still trying to do with us. I hope that the next guy that steals your heart will be just as amazing as I am and you can be assured that the next girl to steal mine will be just as amazing as you, and someday we can argue about whose is better. \n\nYou have given me love. You showed me how to be so happy that I cried tears of joy; something only you did for me. It\u2019s been said that the greatest kind of love is the one that awakens your soul and makes you reach for more. It plants a fire in your heart and gives you peace in mind. You\u2019ll always be the girl that did that for me, and I hope that, at some point, I did that for you. Thank you for everything. Every day I thank whoever runs this universe that you were chose to be my first love and I was chosen to be loved by you. \n\nThank you.\n\nSincerely, \n\nMe \n"

After the Mass I walked her back to her apartment and we're grabbing lunch tomorrow. Thank you all for the prayers, advice, jokes and stories!"

More than once, I feared for my life too much to tell. Granted, I was twelve. Now, I'm 16, and I've been sexually manipulated by men since then. I grew fearful of relationships, and didn't want to trust anyone,  I questioned the intents of men, and couldn't even trust people I loved. Im also in an abusive home, and have almost died with a gun to my head because of my moms abusive ex boyfriends. and can't leave until I'm 17, and don't want to leave for fear of fosterhomes. I hated life. I tried to kill myself, and failed because of my one fear of death. I was trapped in my mindset of life vs death, living and crawling through life painfully, even at such a young age, I had lost optimism. I met this boy through a friend, (fellow redditor) and was interested in him, but fearful of being broken again. We immediately hit it off, and began dating shortly after. I was scared to trust him, and was scared to have sex. We grew more and more fond of each other, he wrote me poems, laid with me for hours, and told me he loved me all the time. We were just so happy around each other, I couldn't help but know this was different. He made me comfortable around him, and made me think there was a ray of hope. The other night, we stayed up until 8 in the morning on Skype (we can't see each other often because of my abusive mom) and he just talked to me about my insecurities, about the origin, and in the end, helped me resolve all of my terrible mindsets about all men. I cried forever because it was such an amazing experience, it was a weight off my chest. I love him so much.\n\nNow, he's also very attractive, and could get any girl he wanted, and even though we don't have sex as much as he could without me, he actually wants to be around me, and just always remind me that I'm his whole world, and without me his life wouldn't be the same at all. \n\nNow for the mushy part.\n\n So, my boyfriend and I were laying on his bed, just relaxing, when he turned the lights off so there were no lights besides some christmas lights, he turned some really soft piano music on, insense burning, and brought out some massage oil, he had me lay on my stomach shirtless, and he gave me the most mind blowing massage. (Note, I've never had a massage in my life, and this being my first, set my standards ridiculously high) for like, twenty minutes until the song ended. \nI was so happy, I thought it was the sweetest thing ever done for me, I was so happy, right when I thought it was over; then another song started. \nI lay on my back, and he gave me the most incredible, topping the last, body massage in history. Flavored massage oil, he didn't miss a spot massaging the oil in and licking it off. Now, I'm normally a pretty self-conscious person, I get worried about my appearance, and even though my boyfriend and I have a healthy sex life, I still have a hard time showing my body openly.  Mostly because of being raped and abused.  But I was just completely comfortable, it was like he loved my body even though I didn't. Each movement was in unison to the piano, and just relaxing and virtually mind blowing in pleasure. I had never felt so loved my entire life. I felt like nothing could ruin it, I began tearing because of how happy I was that someone actually loved me and would go out of their way to do that. I know I've found the person I want to be with, I don't care if I'm young, I've never felt appreciated, I've never felt a reason to live. Anyone who thinks you can't be young and be in love, and know any aspect of what you want is wrong. I've met people who meet when they're 11 and are now in their 80's and madly in love. I have situational depression, and I know he's holding me together unlike any counceling and person I've ever met. \n\nI hope you guys enjoyed this, I love him, and will do anything to keep him forever.

I think it's everything, from how beautiful she is, to how she makes me laugh, and how every moment I spend with her is like floating! So far, we've only been on one date, where we went to a store, then lied in the park for a couple hours and just talked and laughed.\n\nI'm really nervous about giving her my heart, since I've kept myself from heartbreak by not falling, but with her, I feel like if I don't give my all, I'll only be more disappointed with myself.\n\nOh well, I'm going to invite her out for coffee tomorrow!

I am immensely in love with him and I want to spend my life with him and no one else. I think he feels the same way but you never really know for sure without asking. We're in our mid twenties, and have been together a little less than a year.  Yeah we have some milestones to pass and we're young still and yada yada, but I've never felt such a feeling with such intensity as the love I have for this man, and the desire I have to be there for him for the rest of my life and have him by my side for the rest of his. I know women think about this a lot more than men do, and especially in our mid twenties. We get baby/marriage fever sometimes. Especially if friends are getting married or have kids.\n\nI should mention that we casually mention \"our\" marriage/kids in conversations at times and neither of us get awkward or uncomfortable upon its mention.\n\nSo my question, readers of reddit, is should I bring this feeling up to him? Should I tell him I feel so strongly for him that I don't want anyone else ever again? Should I wait till more time passes and just keep my mouth shut? Or should I wait for him to bring it up?\n\n**Edit: Update: Yeah, I think I'll wait. You guys are all right. Thanks Reddit! :)**\n"

It\u2019s the person who knocked you down, who created the monster you are today. It\u2019s the person who made you second guess yourself, who you are, what you will be. It\u2019s the person who couldn\u2019t have been worse to you, yet they\u2019re still in the back of your mind years later. Your memories are distant, yet so fresh. Some days they don\u2019t exist. Others, they\u2019re your every being. It isn\u2019t fair and it surely isn\u2019t beautiful. Maybe in a sense it is. I don\u2019t know. All I know is love is the memories that haunt your past. The feelings that won\u2019t go away. One day it\u2019s hate, one it\u2019s missing every piece of the person who did you wrong. It\u2019s the weeks of not being able to sleep, then being perfectly fine. It\u2019s missing the shows you used to watch, then wondering how you even got through all those series without growing bored. It\u2019s revisiting the place you met, your first kiss, the first place you fell for them and then instantly hating those places. It\u2019s looking at the person you\u2019re with now and wondering if things are going to work out, if you\u2019re going to be able to push away the thoughts of your past. Part of you even wonders if you want to push those parts away because they\u2019re the biggest part of you. What defines us is our yesterdays, our decisions that brought us here. Love is wondering if they still think of you this way. It\u2019s wondering if your thoughts are normal or completely, absolutely insane. Really, how can you consider something so evil in your past love? Yet, that\u2019s all it is. There\u2019s no other definition for it. It\u2019s love. Love hurts after all, right? I think that\u2019s what they mean when they say that. Love is pain. Love is beauty. Love is this and there\u2019s no way around it. There\u2019s no hope of going back, yet you cling to it with all of your might. Hell, you don\u2019t even want to go back, but somehow, you know you would in a heartbeat. There\u2019s still something there. There always will be. Always. It seems stupid, impossible even. But it\u2019s true and that\u2019s love. "

However i got the feeling, probably wrong cause \"hey, i'm in love!\" that she somewhat likes me, because she smiles everytime we meet, and says \"we are going to meet again, right?\" when i go away (that sounds weird, i know) and made me more compliments than anybody else. But get back to the question:\nI have the chance to attend to an university class (we are in high school) about molecular and genetic Biology, and i can bring a person with me. Do you think it'll be ok if i ask her to partecipate? Or it'll be inconsiderate, for she already has a boyfriend? I know she is into this kind of stuff because we talked about that, so it won't annoy her, also her boyfriend doesn't live in the same city as we do, but very near, so they don't meat each other every day, so i have the \u201clong-distance relationship bonus\"\nPlease, help me, i really like this girl and want to be with her more than anything else, and want to stay with her even as a friend, thanks.\nSorry for any spelling error.\n"

Love it not predictable; it can change people drastically; from happy to sad, sad to happy, calm to angry, logical to emotional. And when it changes you, you\u2019re taken by such surprise. Especially for the first time things go well. You wonder why there is this feeling of happiness emanating from the very centre of your being, inside, and you can tell it is glowing even though you can\u2019t see it. It is exciting and scary at the same time. \n\nThe scariest part of love is how dependent it is, and how dependent it is not. It is dependent on two people sharing a feeling in order to make you happy and bliss, but is not dependent on two people to hurt you. You could be the only one feeling these feelings and, if not reciprocated by the other, the feelings remain. They do not disappear. The survival of love is dependent on two; the death of it is dependent on only one.\n\nAnd that is why love can become a slippery slope. It can make you the happiest you have ever been, but can also can make you more miserable than you have ever been. And this is why some people do not bother themselves with it, because of its danger. This is why some people, that look crazy to us before we\u2019ve experienced love and its consequences, choose to never be in a relationship and pursue more casual ventures. Because when love makes you the most miserable, it becomes a sickness that has no cure, that has no temporary bandage, that has no solution other than time. Time eventually helps making that love irrelevant, but it is forever etched in your mind and something you will always think about and look back at, at some point in your life.\n\nSome will argue love is worth it, some will argue it is not, but this piece is not about making that judgement; it is about understanding love. When I fell in love, without realizing it, I felt this bliss around me. This happiness that I couldn\u2019t tell why I was feeling, but I was just feeling it. This feeling of excitement, of utter peace. And then, inevitable as we all do, I got burned by it. And this feeling, previously of joy, excitement, turned to feelings of misery and torture. They turned into this hurt that would pain on the inside, constantly, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I tried understanding, I tried being angry, I turned to writing and to friends, but at the end of the day I couldn\u2019t help but look at the past, remember how I felt and not let this immense feeling of despair take over, and have this gravity feel like it was pulling me beneath the earth.\n\nLove is an adventure, without any rationale or restrictions or parameters. It is boundless, it has no rules nor limitations. I suppose, keeping the balance factor in life in mind, that something that has the potential of limitless happiness, it only makes sense that it should have the potential of limitless sadness as well."

Wade* and calling for an end to all abortion.\n\n>The right and duty to preserve life cannot co-exist with a right or duty to destroy it. The right and duty to preserve and protect the cherished relationship between mother and child cannot co-exist with a right and duty to destroy it. It is the law, as it represents the collective interests of the individuals for whom it exists, that must choose which set of interests it must protect, and long ago our law was required to choose life over death; the mother's beautiful interest in her child's life over its destruction; the protection of innocent children over the misguided philosophies and trends in social thought which come and go.\n\n>If there are any self-evident and universal truths that can act for the human race as a guide or light in which social and human justice can be grounded, they are these: that life has intrinsic value; that each individual human being is unique and irreplaceable; that the cherished role of a mother and her relationship with her child, at every moment of life, has intrinsic worth and beauty; that the intrinsic beauty of motherhood is inseparable from the beauty of womanhood; and that this relationship, its unselfish nature and its role in the survival of the race is the touchstone and core of all civilized society. Its denigration is the denigration of the human race. This relationship, its beauty, its survival, its benefits to the mother and child, its benefits to society, all rest in the self-evident truth that a mother is not the owner of her child's life \u2013 she is the trustee of it."

I buried that feeling deep inside. But the truth is I'm not mad at you, even though I said I was. I wanted to stay away for awhile and I'm sorry for that. I just really miss you. I have been missing you all along. I missed you the second you walked away. The second I knew you weren't mine anymore. The second i saw you jump on in that plane and flee. You felt like air when I was drowning. Please, let me fix this because I love you more than I knew I could. I love you more than letting you just walk away. "

It was nothing to me, but a lie that I'd been searching and waiting, and hoping for my entire life. It was basically the same thing as Santa Clause, just something people tell you about to keep your hope up, and to give you purpose, but doesn't actually exist. I had accepted the fact that I was love-less, and since it was not real in my eyes, that's how it was going to stay and I was okay with that. \nI went months, happily living my life without a care in the world about finding my love, soul mate, whatever you want to call it. As lonely as it was, I was determined to be happy. Determined to not care about the opposite sex, and to stay away from relationships and all the hurt that came along with them.\nOne night, a friend dragged me out of my comfortable bed, and made me go to a party with them. I had an interview in the morning, and didn't want to be out late, so I agree'd as long as we only stayed for a few hours I'd go. \nSo we get there, and the first person I see, the very first person I notice at all, before I even walk through the door completely, was the one I'd been searching for. I couldn't help but stare, and almost instantly was caught. They looked right back at me, and I don't know if it was just me, but there was something there right from that first glance. We then proceeded to introduce ourselves, and spend the entire night hanging out. They didn't mind that I decided to not drink and be the DD of the night, and I didn't care that they were getting drunk as a skunk with all our friends. We followed each other around like lost puppies all night long. Man was that an interesting night. Fights broke out, I almost got smashed in the head with a bottle. Windows broken, beer pored all over peoples heads... Let's just say people get really fucking rowdy. Sadly, around six AM, I had to pry myself away and go home to get some sleep for my interview.\nThe next day I added them on facebook, and waited to see if they'd say something to me. I waited for almost a week for any little conversation started to pop up. I didn't know what was wrong with me, sitting by a computer all day, every day for a week, just waiting. Then finally I gathered up the balls to message them. At first their responses came very slowly, and seemed uninterested, but as a little time went on, they started starting the conversations, and trying to make plans. We'd hang out every once in a while, and this went on for about a month before we spent our first night together. They knew damn well I had feelings for them, so saying yes to crashing at my place was sort of me trying to see if they felt the same.\nwe cuddled all night, as gay as it might be, and we kissed, and it was absolutely breathe taking. We did nothing more then hold each other, play-wrestle, and laugh. It was such a perfect night. \nThe next day was the big day. We started dating, and six months later I'm sitting here writing about it, because that was the best month and half of my life. I'd taught myself to not believe in love, convinced myself I had all I needed. Never once would I have believed you if you were to tell me that I'd fall in love just by one glance. Love at first sight was a myth. Things did not happen that way, until that night. The night I almost missed because of a stupid interview. The night I was close to skipping out on because I was all comfy-cozy in my bed when asked to go. The night that changed my entire outlook on the world. I'm here now, with the person I belong with, happy, and completely content with life. Who would have known one awful party could be looked at in such a wonderful way, all because of one particular person. That person, that was part of a gender that I'd hated. I'd refused to give the time of day. \nI sometimes wonder if I'd still be like how I was, today, if I had not met that person. But it almost pains me to think about a time where they were not in my life. It's always been them, I just never knew it."

            "value": "\u201cBeing in love\u201d is a feeling. A nice one. Perhaps one of the strongest forces on the planet. But it does not, ever, guarantee a succesful marriage. Working with marriage nullity regularly, I see almost *no* cases where the couples are *not* in love when they marry. They are almost *always* in love and *never* foresee serious problems. But this feeling inevitably goes away and the marriage, if it is not made up of virtuous people with virtuous goals, will regularly fall apart. This is one of the tragedies of love and part of what makes it so special when it\u2019s there: *it goes away*. On the other side, not \u201cbeing in love\u201d (despite what petitioners insist) does *not* invalidate marriage. You *do not have to be in love* to validly marry. This is important. Because when it doesn\u2019t work out, *you are bound to stay in the marriage*.\n\nFor these reason, when you seek a spouse, answer these questions in the most objective way possible:\n\n1.\tDoes this person possess the necessary virtues for a *permanent* marital relationship to support you and the things you need *and will need* in life? If the answer is no, do not marry.\n\n2.\tDoes this person possess the necessary virtues to have and **raise** children *even in the most difficult of circumstances* (including disability, loss of life, the unexpected inability to have children, etc.)? If the answer is no, do not marry.\n\nNote that these are *objective* questions. They are simply yes/no questions about truth. That is, they are not about your feelings about the other person. For this reason asking *others* who are wise (usually not your peers) who have gone through successful marriages is *incredibly advisable*. Your emotions often define how you think. For this reason, you are regularly the *last* person to trust when it comes to evaluating the questions above. You may have the facts about the person, but you do not have the proper perspective. The people you seek advice from should be *virtuous* and not just experienced. The best way to learn if one has the virtue necessary for success is to ask a person who has virtue him or herself already.\n\nThe other source you seek is the Church. The Church, especially throughout history, has provided incredibly helpful and clear guidelines for how and why to marry. Seek wide types of sources in the Church (including older ones), not just your pastor (but seek him out *first* **before** you\u2019re thinking about marriage; once people are on the ride, they rarely want to get off). \n\nTurning to the other side of the issue, you need to ask the above questions *about yourself*. If the answer is no to either, *do not marry*. You often think too highly of yourself. You think you possess these traits. But you often do not. More than this though, you think that you can just *will* through your weaknesses. And maybe that\u2019s true sometimes in your life. Maybe you can be vicious in some ways and still get along in life (we all do it). But you *cannot* do this when *someone else is involved*. The vice you have spreads and deterioriates the union. You cannot simply power through your bad traits. *You* need to be good *before* you marry.\n\nHow do you know if you possess these traits? Ask yourself whether you are virtuous *in other, everyday ways*. Are you able to make a bed in the morning without grumbling? Are you able to easily turn away at something overly sexual? Are you able to not eat an extra piece of pizza even when you\u2019re still hungry? Are you able to listen to an annoying boss or coworker without grinding your teeth or giving flippant responses? Are you able to not gossip? If you are not virtuous in the everyday, you *will not* be virtuous in marriage. This is how virtue works. If *you* are not good in a general sense, you are will not be good in this specific sense.\n\nA final comment. Marriage is about risk. You might be perfect and you might be absolutely certain about your choice, even after consulting others on it. But it\u2019s still risk. The other person can flake out, can cheat, can ruin your life. The other person can even go get someone else pregnant or get pregnant herself. This would not change whether you are married. This would not change whether you are obligated to this person (who hurt you in the most profound way) for life. Until you accept this fact, completely and in every circumstance, do not marry.\n\nTo be clear. You do not have to be perfect or even good to validly marry. Marriage is for even the worst of us. This post is about success in marriage. If you have any questions about the sorts of red flags I see or about anything else, let me know. "

After some more tough I decided to write it again as a post here.**\n\n\nImagine how wonderful would be if when you see a person, you can see a number above their head. This number is the percentage of compatibility with that person to achieve and maintain a stable relationship. Let's say is a percentage from 0 to 100 and is a mutual number. When you see a 83.2% on a person, that person sees a 83.2% on your head. In this way it would be so effing easy to start a relationship! \n\nThe online dating sites try to calculate something like this number with algorithms but there are so many variables that are far from accurate.  In the real life we are blindly trying out to figure the numbers by trial and error.  We may have seated besides a 99% on the bus and will never know it.  \n\nBut lets go back to imagine a world where you can see this number.\n\nYou go on your daily life walking on the street surrounded by a lot of people under 20% and then you see an 89% above someone, and he/she sees you, you both look into each other eyes, smile, break the ice and then go for a coffee and find that you are really so compatible!\n\nBut then you go to see a movie, you both like the movie and at the end of the it when you come out of the cinema you see an 90% now. What happened? Everybody is constantly learning and growing, no matter the age. Each new experience, book, movie, people you met, every bit of information you receive becomes part of you and you are constantly changing in small ways.\n\nYou both start your relationship at 90% but then you both get a dog and the way you both react to the dog and what the dog becomes in your life make the number go up to 95%.\n\nShe (lets keep it as a she for simplicity) reads a book very important for you, but she doesn't like it. It doesn't have the same meaning for her. It relates to something you experienced in your childhood that she didn't . As she goes on reading the book, the number goes down gradually to 94.5%. Is it something bad? is it her fault? nope, maybe is your fault because you give too much importance to this specific book.  \n\nThis continues for months, years, the number goes up and down many times and then one day you realize that the number is 65%. You still love her, but the relationship is not so solid as before. You are walking in the street and see another girl with a 78% above her.  In fact you realize that in the last months you have seen at leat 3 people with a higher number than your actual SO. What do you do?  End your years-long relationship and go chase something better? try to work together to increase back the number to at least an 80%?  \n\nI now find funny the concept of soulmate. That there is one person out there who is destined to be your significant other and if you are not paying attention you may miss on the opportunity of meeting the love of your life.\n\nWhat I learned is that there not one soulmate, this is not a black or white situation. Every person you meet has a percentage of compatibility with you, some may be very high, around 95%, and you may call them soulmates, but the truth is: 1. there is more than one person above 90% out there and 2. nobody keeps the same number forever, people changes."

I had to take her out from the pew 3 different times.  Unfortunately she views the cry room as a treat where she just gets to play, so we can't take her in there or she thinks that she can just behave badly and be rewarded by going to the ~~cry room~~ play room.\n\nOur 4 year old girl was her normal dramatic self.  Talking loudly or making noises every once in a while for no reason.  Can't keep her still and has to change places in the pew multiple times.  Really nothing out of the norm- but still a pain.\n\nOur 6 year old boy who is usually really good was being loud, and kept flopping his body around throughout Mass instead of at least trying to be reverent.  When I told him to stop he was resistant and bordering on disobedient.  Upon returning from one of my visits to the back with the 2 yo, it was starting to come to a head with the boy just before Communion, so my wife- while nursing our 5 week old- had to take him out.  When they got back into the pew after Communion I told him to kneel with everyone and say a prayer to ask God for help and he refused and started going berserk (which we have had issues with outside of Church for about a week now) and throwing a tantrum.\n\nAt this point the 2 year old was starting to be loud again, so I grabbed the keys and took 2yo and 6yo out to sit in the van.\nWent back in to help my wife get the baby and 4 year old and all our stuff together as closing song was just ending... and everyone around turned to us...\n\nAnd I was totally blown away by their reactions.  Not a single person who approached us was upset or angry or whatever.  EVERYONE applauded our patience, telling us that it was a gift, etc.  Even one older gentleman approached us to tell us that he was a visitor from another parish, that he thought our family was beautiful, and also told us that he was blown away by our patience and told us that he was happy to see us bringing our family to Mass, even while they were having a hard time.  When I apologized to everyone around, they all insisted that we had nothing for which to apologize, and laughed it off.  It just felt amazing.\n\nJust wanted to share this here to express my gratitude towards people who understand that sometimes young parents need the support and understanding of their fellow parishioners when their kids are having a rough day, and to encourage you all to approach families with similar sentiment as my fellow parishioners did yesterday."

As Gloria was sung, the front of the church suddenly lit up while the rest was dark was just wow.  It felt really epic.\n\nThen, the sacraments of initiation were introduced and I held the father's and my sponsors hand and walked through the isles of the Church.  I wanted to cry right then and there, especially as we approached the font.  I had so many things go through me as I stepped into font and had the water poured over my head.  When I came out though, I felt lighter, free of sin (for now).\n\nAfter I was confirmed, I had the huge honor of helping present the Eucharist & gifts to the Father and the Church.  Presenting the Eucharist bread was quite possibly the biggest honor I've ever had in my life.  Afterwards, I stood behind the altar with  the other RCIA students (now friends) who also got confirmed that night and took first communion.  My one regret this night is I didn't focus on the body and blood of Christ as I should have.  Possibly because I was still overcoming with emotion (and fear of messing something up).\n\nI think I can say last night was the best night of my life.  "

All of these intoxicating emotions really take a toll on you, when you realize it couldn't possibly work. For one reason or another,  some extenuating circumstance prevents you to from having something with them that everyone dreams about.\n\nYou begin to dip into another valley of loneliness, hopefulness, and slight desperation. You start binging on all the things they enjoy. Watching youtube playlists of their favorite artists becomes a new hobby. Typing out a huge text expressing your feelings, then erasing it, isn't uncommon most nights while laying in bed.\n\nFor me the plight of a heteronormative society is very strong.

Something I have seen for a long time here, and in other communities (virtual and real) of faithful Catholics is the tacit assumption by many that married couples with no children, or married couples with only one or two or three children, are not faithful Catholics, or that they are using contraception against church teaching. In fact, this has been tugging at my heart lately, because I am ashamed to say that I used to be one of these people. When I first converted, and ditched contraception, my husband and I felt ready (and a little scared) to welcome as many children into our family as the Lord would give us. We bought a house with 5 bedrooms, because we just **knew** that we would be having a ton of kids. We needed to have that extra space, after all, because they would probably come one after another, and we didn't want to have to worry about moving for a long time. After converting, and learning that many people who profess to be Catholic still use contraception, I sometimes sat in Mass and scanned the room to look at the families. Families with one or two kids and middle-aged parents who didn't look like they were young enough to have more would get a slightly scornful look from me. \"But surely,\", I thought, \"they must not have been open to life in their childbearing years. I wonder if they regret it now?\". I would sit there, so smug, and so proud, thinking that I somehow got the \"best Catholic\" award for following ALL of the Church's teachings, even the hard ones. I would look approvingly at the frazzled mom with 6 kids and a nursing baby, and think, \"yes, yes, you are my kind of person. we can be good Catholics together, once I have my family of 6+ kids.\"\n\n\nI am ashamed to admit this now, because I now know that even though I thought I was being the \"perfect\" Catholic, I was actually missing a really big sin, and that sin was Pride. I feel as though the Holy Spirit always finds way to confront us with our unknown sins in order to show us how we are wrong so we can improve. The next part of my story is about that.\n\n\nMy husband and I went merrily along our way, no contraception, and using NFP pretty much only for trying to conceive. And trying. And trying. FINALLY, we conceived a son, and he was born healthy--the light of our lives. After a few months of not touching each other because having a newborn is chaos, we thought we'd try for another. We giggled at how having \"two under two\" was going to be so CRAZY, and maybe we could even have \"three under three\". We were going to have a crazy and chaotic house full of kids. We were on our way to being the *Perfect Catholic Family\u00ae*! It took over a year, but I became pregnant again. We were thrilled, but something never felt right to me. I never got morning sickness. I didn't feel pregnant. It turns out, we lost our little Saint early on-around 6 weeks gestation. We never even got to see his or her little heartbeat. After the miscarriage, we were cleared to try again, so trying we have been, and so far, despite charting and perfect timing, I have not conceived. I will be 31 this year, and we are still trying, always trying, but I am starting to realize that I may not ever get that big Catholic family. And I was sad about it. But, I also learned a very important lesson--when we choose to be open to life, and put God in control of our family size, we may end up with 9 kids. We also may end up with no kids, or only 1 kid. We may end up with all of our kids in Heaven. Once I accepted this, I realized what a jerk I had been for so long, thinking that I could judge others based on how many kids they had.\n\n\nBut now that I have had this realization, I see the same behavior from other faithful Catholics EVERYWHERE. I met a fellow mom in the cry room at Mass who *bragged* to me that she had 4 kids and she had *only* been married for 4 years...and they were going to try again soon. She even told me that she didn't nurse her babies very long so she could get her fertility back sooner to have them more quickly (wut?) She told me that she was thinking of joining a different, \"more traditional\" parish, because there were more \"large families\" there. I could only remark, sadly, \"You know, it's not that easy for everyone\", and then she preached to me something about having more faith and then things would work out.\n\n\nI'm not complaining. I think I deserve to be confronted with my sin of pride. I see it online too, in comments here and there about small family sizes, and the \"culture of death\" that surrounds so many Catholic families.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are a lot of Catholics who use contraception against Church teaching, and many of those Catholics are poorly catechized and may not know the gravity of that sin. There are also many Catholics who know it is a grave sin, but don't care and do it anyway. But, the farther along I go in this journey of marriage and motherhood, the more I meet others like me: A friend, who has one toddler, and has had 4 first-trimester miscarriages. She is a mother of 5. Another friend, who had a toddler, was pregnant with twins, and lost them at 5 months. She is currently pregnant again.  To the outside observer, she looks like she has 1 child. In reality, she has 4. \n\nI wanted to share this. I also want to apologize. If I ever judged you for your family size, I am ashamed and sorry. All families are beautiful, large and small. And all children are gifts from God. Family size is not a competition. \n\n<3 "

She's never been that usual girly girl, a bit tom boy and likes shit that normal girls don't like. More so, she is a bit defensive and doesn't let anyone get near her.\n\nHowever over the time i've discovered that this girl is probably the girl I want to spend the rest of my life with. This girl is so perfect that probably there isn't going to be anyone as her who is going to complete me as she does it.\n\nLast month, I've declared to her saying that she i'm so in love with her. She said we were just friends.\n\nToday, after a party that i've went with her, I once again I tried to tell her that I'm really in love with her. This time reality brought pain as friend.\n\nAfter I've opened my heart to her how perfect she is and how awesome she is, she started explaining to me how even she is unsure of her sexuality. After she explain all of her relationships with woman she started telling me that since she is a grown up she didn't found any love with man. She had casual make out sessions with man but she founds more connection with woman, being that she has only been with one and got interested in another one. I tried to tell her to open her heart to other people, to let people inside her heart. We had such a great chemistry and we could try something, even if for a week. I've tried to hug her, but still the worst part is that, even after that she said that for now we were just friends.\n\nRight now I can't get any sleep. Seriously I've even considered suicide right about now but I doubt I have the courage to even do that. I just wish i could forget ever knowing her. More so I wish I was dead right now. No girl will ever be as perfect as she is and she will always be the mark as I found other girls. My presence in in reality right now has become pointless.\n\nHow can God even exist if he is this cruel.\n"

We talked a lot that first day. Then it continued. Everyday. \n\nSadly he and are are on completely different continents. So it makes it difficult to meet (we haven't yet, but planning on it in the near future.)\n\nWe have an awesome connection. We like the same things. We have the same goals. But as in any relationship, we've hit a few kinks along the way. \n\nDuring one of those kinks we actually stopped talking. Rather he stopped talking to me because of a girl he had met in his country. \n\nI was in love with him but didn't tell him because I was terrified of love. I still am. But I was more afraid of loving someone so much, who I haven't even met in person. \n\nHe finally told me what was going on and I stupidly told him then, at the worst possible time that I loved him. He asked why I hadn't told him sooner. \n\nHe had found someone else because he thought I wasn't interested. That relationship lasted less than a month and we were committed to being just friends to give his new relationship a chance to grow.  It didn't last very long. Can't say that I was very sad about that though. \n\nThis is where my big mistake came in. After this episode, I became Rey jealous. Possessive. Needy. I was afraid of losing him again. This definitely wasn't my proudest moment. We fought a lot. \n\nWe continued our amorous relationship after that. Fast forward 6 months and he starts acting weird. Not Answering messages. Even evading me. \n\nEventually I had given up on him. I moved on. Tried a relationship with another guy. But that didn't work out. \n\nThen out of the blue, a couple of months after we had gone separate ways he sent me an email. Told me that he had met another girl and felt like a jerk so he evaded me. Thought ignoring me would be better than telling me the truth. \n\nI had done a lot of growing up during the time we didn't speak. I was more sure of myself. I told him I forgave him and that I did miss my best friend. \n\nWe talked a lot in the next days. He finally told me he hadn't gotten over me and that he missed what we had. I still loved him, I just refused to tell him. I didn't want to be hurt again like I had been. \n\nFinally one day I decided I had had enough of hiding my feelings for him. Not telling him what I felt for him almost made me lose him once. I wasn't about to let it happen again.\n\nI told him I loved him. He said that he had been giving me space and time to decipher my feelings and that he too loved me more than he could explain in words.\n\nThis is technically our third go around at this in one and a half years. I love him more than anything and I have learned to trust him again. He expresses his love to me daily and I do the same. \n\nWe've both grown matured significantly and realized we want this relationship to work out. We don't fight and speak regularly on the phone. \n\nSo after this long story Reddit, do you believe long distance online love can exist and flourish? And have you ever fallen in love with someone online in a different country, and did it work out?\n\n"

Sitting at HuHot eating dessert rangoons at my brother's birthday. Looking at this boy who was too handsome to be my brother's friend. With his perfect teeth and laughing brown eyes and overwhelming natural charm.\n\nFast forward, helping move into the house we live in now. Moving furniture and making jokes, but still being too young to really know how to approach a boy. Innocent, shy, and naive.\n\nAnd then sitting in the basement that is now my bedroom but was then a game room. Listening to music - offspring, slipknot, system of a down, everything - and playing video games. Talking about anything.\n\nGoing to cemeteries when I got into high school. \"Ghost hunting\" until ungodly hours. Trespassing at Menninger's. All the while watching him fall in and out of love with other girls.\n\nWe used to drive around with my brother. Go to echo cliff each with our own 2 liter of Mountain Dew. He would always help me up if I slipped. Or give me his jacket when I was cold.\n\nAnd then I took a risk.\n\nStarted texting him and talking to him and we started our own friendship. Not one that made us friends through my brother, but friends in our own right.\n\nAnd it wasn't long before we started talking about being more than friends. Feelings got involved.\n\nAnd then a summer of house arrest. Where he visited me almost every day. And a tent in the back yard where he kissed me for the first time and held me while I cried. That's the summer I realized I was in love. And I was so mad when I realized it. He went to boot camp that summer. I waited for him.\n\nWhen he got back, things were different. I thought I'd lost him. He didn't care about me and everything he'd said had been a lie. I spent a winter hurting over him.\n\nThe next spring we reconciled. Things weren't necessarily the same, but it was ok. We were friends again. We went to Rockfest together. The Pretty Reckless, Korn, and Killswitch Engage. He probably saved me from getting trampled to death a thousand times that day. It's still my favorite day of my entire life.\n\nAnd then we were working together and he lived with my brother and I could see him always. Got to fall asleep in his arms a few nights. I always felt safe. I've missed those nights desperately since 2014.\n\nThen he and my brother had a falling out. I was torn. My brother, or the man I'd fallen in love with. I didn't really ever choose. But he and I kept talking. We cultivated a relationship of our own. He was my safe place even if he wasn't ever mine to claim.\n\nHe took me on our first date July 1, 2015. I was arrested just over a week later.\nWe weren't a couple while I was in jail. But he answered when I called. He showed up to my court date. He came to visit me the day I got out. He never gave up on me.\n\nWhen I got out he took me on another date. And then we became a couple. And then I screwed it up.\n\nBut if I can forget that. If I can remember everything else we ever were before I got out. I can get through this. No one will ever see him the way I do. I still look at him with the eyes of a child starring hopefully at a knight in a princess story. Just hoping he'll be there.\n\nHe's so far from perfect. But no matter if he loves me or if he hurts me, I think I'll still choose him every time."

And on that boat ride, I started thinking. I knew I loved him, but at that time your dad had just dropped out of college, working as a Production Assistant, who, as you know, are kind of the slaves of the entertainment business. He wasn't making that much money. But you know what? When I saw him I saw his potential. I knew he would be a great husband, and a great father. So I said yes.\" \n\n\nThey've been married for eighteen years now, and my dad is currently an executive producer/co-founder of a successful company specializing in car commercials. Personally, I couldn't have asked for a better father. "

Then - upon thinking this, I suddenly met this girl and got to know her... Over the past three months I've been getting to know her better, I only see her in school but when we do talk it tends to be good conversation. As well as that, she starts conversation sometimes when she's with her friends. I don't like to think I could have such feelings for someone so fast but I truly think I do. She's very musical - like myself. She's pretty much a professional cellist aged 17, and I a pianist. I feel like we'd fit well both as people and musicians but I have this constant underlying fear that i'll ask her for coffee or something someday and either we'll get close and then it won't work out or she'll just reject me entirely. I told a couple of friends about it and they said they'd see what they thought, and after assessing her body language and other things around me, they said I should go for it. Every time I see her I mean to ask her but it genuinely slips my mind and all I can feel is the butterflies in my stomach. She truly is the most elegant, beautiful human being I ever have known. I don't feel like I'm at the stage yet where we could really classify ourselves as really good friends but I feel such a strong bond with her that could just grow exponentially for eternity... I guess, what I'm attempting to say is... Should I go for it? Apologies for not shortening down this spiel my fellow redditors. ^.^ \n  \nTL;DR Met amazing girl (after deciding to stop looking) with same interests as me who has shown signs of having feelings: go for it or not?

A very lapsed Catholic. His grandmother goes to the parish I attend. She taught him a degenerate form of Catholicism and I have given him a more nuanced and charitable version, a truer version. There was no love in what he was taught. Through my endless lectures though, he has decided to come to church for six weeks with me. Pray for him please. \nWe go to a little bakery with another one of our friends every Saturday morning and I have been talking to him about the Church as well. He is very interested and was never really well-versed on what it means to be a Catholic and how you don't lose individuality in the church.

            "value": "Last week at RCIA, I asked about when first confession would take place and they encouraged me to go ahead and start going anytime I was ready. Today I was ready. I was baptized a child as a Baptist over 13 years ago. Obviously, I can't remember every single sin from those years, just the persistent ones and prominent ones from recently, so I went in trying not to worry and just understanding that they are with me when I go to confession and they'll be absolved forever. I was going to schedule a specific appointment for my first confession, but I was already comfortable with the process itself and its parts, and I'm also terrible with making phone calls (major anxiety, even when just talking with family) so I went ahead and went today. I was overwhelmed with nerves, breathing heavily, but I pushed through knowing the blessings and power waiting for me in the confessional room.\n\nWhen I walked out of there, I had never felt more pure and ecstatic and bright in my entire life! In that room the presence and absolving power of Jesus Christ Himself came and lifted 13+ years of sin off the shoulders of my soul and wiped them away forever. There are no words, only joy, a pure joy. Mass afterwards was crackling with the Holy Spirit, and even though my time hasn't come to receive Christ in the Eucharist, the blessings and encounter with Christ in that sacred space were awesome and fulfilling enough for me in the light of holy absolution, sacred forgiveness. Thank God for Christ our Lord and Savior and His One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church and all of her blessed sacraments. Amen. Just thought y'all would enjoy! God bless you all."

For those who don't know the backstory she's a fairly committed atheist and convinced my dad to stop going to Church and praying before meals when I was about 5-6. Because of her irrational and extreme hatred of all religious creeds, the word \"God\" was never said except in swearing in our household. When my father got into a fight with her she gathered up his Bibles and religious books and drove them down to goodwill to get rid of, citing that he was unreasonable and cruel because he had followed religion in the past. \n\nWhen I became a Catholic it was the most exceptionally difficult thing I've done for that reason. Out of all religions, I quickly found that she hated this one the most, and i spent years trying to apologize for it and weaken it for her approval. Eventually, after uncountably many fights and arguments, we achieved our own sort of Peace of Augsburg. I was allowed to go to Church so long as she didn't drive me, I was allowed to pray so long as it was silent, and religion was never a suitable topic for the dinner table or any room she was in. I was also forbidden absolutely to use my allowance money to give to the Church in any form including to the poor box. But I could at least be Catholic, and aside from the occasional dig at me about following the Pope or being responsible for aids or believing in magic, she pretty much left it alone and tried to pretend it wasn't happening.\n\nI would get dressed on Sundays and she would say \"So you're going to...um...the place...again?\" Couldn't even say it.\n\nI don't know, man. I need a hug. I love my mom, of course, and I think in every other respect she was a perfect mother and raised me really well: to be respectful, hardworking, polite. She read to me and fostered a love of reading, and of traveling. But it frustrates me no end how I'm viewed as having like a drug addiction or something because of what I believe.\n\nYeah. I know Jesus said it would happen. I'm just kinda down right now. Religion is NOT doing what you're told even if it goes against what's right, and memes are not a suitable source of philosophy."

This is probably going to be really long.\n\n     So a little about me first, I'm 20 yrs old and never really been in a relationship. It's not that I'm super ugly or anything like that, girls try to talk to me all the time, but I was just never interested. I still live with my parents and they have had talks with me about it being ok to tell them I was gay and shit like that (they assumed I was because I never brought over any girls and one of my only friends is a guy that has a lisp and sounds gay, acts a little gay too to be honest. He might be Idk we never talked about it). I'm not gay at all, never even had a gay thought. It bothered me that they assumed I was though. To fix this problem there is a girl that is like madly in love with me and I call her up. I take her out a few times and bring her over and I really tried to like her but I couldn't. I hated physically touching her, we barely even held hands. I couldn't even stand being around her. I called it quits after about a month. I wondered if there was something wrong with me. I knew I wasn't gay but I couldn't stand the girls I attracted. \n     One night, I was hanging out with my friend with the lisp (let's call him James). We were with some of his friends that I don't know and I saw the most beautiful creature I have ever laid eyes upon. She was a tall brown girl with long curly hair. My eyes didn't want to leave her. I tried not to creep her out so I would look away when she looked in my direction. I tried to force her from my mind because she was most definitely out of my league and I knew I wouldn't have a chance. \n     My brother, James, and I were eating Chinese one night and Brandon brought up girls in our conversation. He told me I need a girlfriend and said I should go for Kate (the beautiful creature I mentioned earlier). I never told him my thoughts on her or anything. I chuckled at his suggestion and told him that probably wouldn't happen, then he told me that she had a crush on me. I didn't believe him at all really, because he can be a lying loud mouth at times. I hung out with this group of James's friends a few more times and I liked all of them so I invited them to my house for a bonfire. Kate was all for it and we exchanged numbers. She started texting me and we were planning the bonfire night but it rained us out. She still wanted to do something with us though. She planned a few nights but everybody in the group started to get tired of hanging out so much. \n     I've never felt like this before, yes I've had a few little crushes but this girl drove me crazy. I had to drive 30-45 minutes to hang out with these people but it was so worth it just to see her. I kept on asking James if he was lying about Kate's crush on me and I was trying to work up the courage to ask her out. I had tried to more than a couple times, but something would happen every time. I finally just text her and said I heard she had a crush on me and I definitely had one on her. She was like lol who told you that so I told her James. She said she hasn't even talked to him about me. My heart was broken and I beat up James. She still wanted everyone to hang out and stuff so I still did but it was kinda awkward for me. The group started slimming down until it was me, Kate, her friend, and James. We hung out like that for a few times and I was so confused about the whole situation. She seemed to like me but she said she didn't have a crush on me. One night it was really late and James and her friend fell asleep in my car so Kate and I went to the park. We didn't have anything to do and I suggested getting the blanket from my car and star gazing. I figured I would just try it out, I mean what did I have to lose? She giggled and said it was a great idea!!! My heart is now pumping! We lay the blanket out and talk for a little while then she gets closer to me and nestles up beside me. It's now time to try a kiss. I'm scared to death but I give her a good kiss on the cheek. She smiles at me and kisses me on the lips and we end up kissing and making out for quite some time. \n     So it turns out that she does like me. To be honest I can't figure out why. She is like super smart, gorgeous, and a great person while I was praised for c's, around average looking, and I'm a decent person now but I used to be absolutely terrible. She wants to be with me as much as possible and I love nothing more than being with her. I am absolutely crazy about her. She doesn't leave my mind for a second. I just can't get enough of her. For the first time I love being touched by someone and enjoy holding hands. \n     We have been together almost every night for over a month. I go to work, get home asap to shower, then it's off to be with Kate. I have literally seen her more than my family witch is odd because I don't really leave the house anymore. My parents thought I was on drugs or something and didn't really believe me about me seeing a girl so I had to bring her over. They loved her. Now I have to meet her family. They all seemed to like me... except her dad. He is a preacher and is pretty strict. She hasn't told him how much we have hung out just me and her. He would have a heart attack if he knew. Now that they know about me, I have to ask her parents permission to take her out. They scare the shit out of me but it is well worth it for a night with Kate. \n     Her dad said we can't make the relationship official until they get back from vacation (that was like two weeks away at the time). He wanted to get to know me better. Kate told me he thought I was alright but he wants to have a 1 on 1 with me when they get back so we can make it official. I am scared to death about this 1 on 1 but I will do anything to call her mine. \n     I had been dreading her vacation because it is two weeks long. We were together every night possible until her vacation. I planned a very sweet and romantic picnic for her last day and she loved it. I had to have her home at 4:00pm and I was on time as usual. I then went home, took a nap, and got up at 11:00pm. I was allowed to be at her house at 1:00am to help load up her family's stuff. Her parents had to leave at 1:30 but we didn't have to go until 2:30. I just held her as much as I could until it was time to leave for the airport. I hated the whole thing. I was with her until they had to go through security. She teared up and I just hugged on her until her dad said it was time to go. Sadly I watched her walk away. \n     It is now day 2 of her 2 week vacation. It sucks terribly. I haven't heard anything from her yet because she is out of the country and WiFi and a phone will be hard to come by for a few days but we will Skype and what not soon. Still sucks though\n\n     Well I feel a little bit better, now that is out of my system. Thanks to anyone who actually read the freakin novel I just wrote and excuse the grammar."

No one wants to be mean to someone who is willingly volunteering their time to assist with CCD, or sacramental prep, or whatever. But a lot of times you have people who aren\u2019t vetted and aren\u2019t properly catechized. \n\nPrime example: last night I had to attend a baptism seminar for my geographical parish as our newest son will be baptized this weekend. \nThe layman leading this class didn\u2019t even really discuss baptism. You would think \u201coh, a baptism class. I\u2019m gonna learn the meaning of the water and the candle and the white cloth and the importance of a godparent.\u201d \nNope. Didn\u2019t discuss that at all. Ironically without this $50 class the parish would refuse to baptize my child. \n\nThis guy talked about football, and weirdly enough the sacrament of marriage, and Steve Jobs, and read a book of inspirational quotes. \nMost importantly, he said that he thinks it\u2019s okay for non-Catholics to receive the Eucharist as long as they are going to convert. \nAT A BAPTISM CLASS. And the deacon and I assume pastor as well have scolded him for saying so- so he told us- but he is still permitted to teach this.\n\nI\u2019ve also had other bad experiences- typically involving people teaching the faith in some capacity - where they are wrong but they are a baby boomer who\u2019s been leading bible study for 20+ years so Fr. Newbie Pastor isn\u2019t about to correct or remove them. \n\nAnyway that\u2019s my rant. "

This is not, however, zero-visibility due to darkness, but to intense light, to brilliance that blankets all -- even shadows. In the absence of shadows, one can only assume the absence of anything that can block the light. It is when our eyes get used to that light, when we let go and give in to the pain of zero-visibility, that we truly see clearly.\n\nLike the Israelites coming out of Egypt, led by things they cannot touch -- a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire be night -- the true lover is led by untouchable fires of desire toward understanding."

The birds flying low to the water, with no fear of making a mistake and falling in. The sound of the peaceful waves violently plunging themselves into the rocks. The texture of the grainy sand that lied on the rocks we sat upon. The rush that shot through me when my hand caressed hers. The smell of the salty ocean mixed with her perfume. The feeling I had in my gut. It was a colorful meadow. A meadow full of flowers and gorgeous butterflies fluttering in the wind. I would be happy to be in this meadow. Possibly forever. This meadow took away every fear and worry I had, It was the cure to my disea- \"its getting dark\", she said. Those are the words that snapped me out of the brief seconds of peaceful tranquility, but it was okay. See I say that the words took me out of the moment, but I think this is when it hit me. I wasn't staring at the view. I was staring at her. She is my cure."

You look at me like I'm the same as every other girl in that school. I wish I hadn't worn my faded lemon shirt, and try to subtly push back the sleeve to reveal the Slayer cuff underneath. You don't see it.\n\n***\n\nIt's the end of the day and I'm making my way out of the Science building. As I walk down the stairs, you walk across the corridor. You see my band t-shirt (Slayer, of course) and double-take. You walk backwards to make sure you'd seen what you thought you'd seen. You give a look of approval and walk on. \n\nI'm at the bus stop and you show up. You walk right up to me.\n\n\"Finally, someone in that place with taste!\" \n\nYou introduce yourself to me and declare that you are the Muffin Man. You chase my little sister and her friends, playing the Scary Metalhead. I laugh, but can barely talk to you. I'm shy. \n\n***\n\nI see you again in a club. You wonder where I've been, why you haven't seen me around for a couple of weeks. I've been on holiday. \n\nYou offer to buy me a drink. I don't want to look stupid, so I ask for a Vodka and Coke rather than my usual alcopop. You compliment my new Megadeth tee. \n\nYou chat me up, alot. I like it. You ask if I'm single and I say yes. You act like you don't believe me, but it's just more flattery. You put your arm around me and you kiss me. It was a great kiss; my first and favourite. \n\n***\n\nWe have our second kiss by the bus stop. It's in front of a lot of the girls from school but I don't care. We joke and kiss and I love every second of it. It's late October and it's freezing, but I can barely feel the cold. \n\n***\n\nWe've been seeing each other for a few weeks. I'm smitten. I stay up late most nights hoping to catch you on MSN. I get butterflies whenever you sign in. \n\nI ask you how your weekend was. You tell me that it was great; you went to the pub with your girlfriend.\n\nGirlfriend.\n\nWhat? \n\n***\n\nI'm sad that you were seeing other people besides me, but I want to be your friend anyway. I get a boyfriend and you seem kind of jealous. \n\nYou break up with your girlfriend and I'm having problems with my boyfriend. He's cheated on me, but he doesn't have the decency to face me. I see you in the bar and you're losing it over something. You scream at your friends and they leave you to it. I stay. I let you scream at me and I scream back. It feels good to shout at you.\n\nEven so, I tell you that I'm here for you, and no matter what you say to me, I won't move. You cry on my shoulder and get snot on my top. \n\n***\n\nI've broken up with my boyfriend and we're sitting on a stage in a dark corner. We kiss and it feels like something has fallen into place; like I haven't been a whole person for a long time, but I didn't know it. \n\n***\n\nWe've been seeing each other again and our mutual friend has been on at you to ask me out properly. \n\nIn early May, by the bus stop, you tell me that he threatened to kick you in the balls if you didn't. \n\n\"Fuck it, will you go out with me?\"\n\nI know you're doing this for the wrong reasons, but I'm sixteen and I am so very into you. Of course, I say yes. \n\n***\n\nI'm missing you one night, and you come on MSN. We sit on webcam for hours. We're not even speaking. You're playing WoW and occasionally looking into the cam. I'm mostly just watching you. I watch you for hours. It makes me happy, but for some reason it also makes me sad.\n\n***\n\nI've just arrived at your house. I walk into the kitchen and you're standing at the open window. You turn around and hold me. You tell me that you had a dream where you lost eveyone that you loved, where you lost me. I tell you that I'm here now, and that it was just a dream. A cool breeze comes through the window and raises the hairs on my arms. \n\nYou cheer up and we have lunch. You kiss me. Your mouth is full of chewed Wotsits, which you transfer into my mouth. You know I hate them, and burst out laughing at my horror. \n\n***\n\nWe're leaving a party, being driven home by your dad. It's only a little after 8pm and the sun has just set. You hold my hand in the back seat and lean close.\n\n\"I think I'm falling in love with you\" you whisper.\n\nA lump catches in my throat and I can barely get the words out.\n\n\"Me too.\"\n\n***\n\nWe're on the bench by the bus stop. It's mid-May. The sky is summer-blue and the few clouds are white and lazy. I lean back against you and you buzz teasingly in my ear, making fun of my fear of bees. We laugh and you hold me. An idle breeze caresses my hair. I feel so at peace; so happy. \n\n***\n\nIt's early June and I've just sat an exam. I've been laughing with friends, telling jokes and feeling amazing. It's like a weight has been lifted off. \n\nI wait at the bus stop to meet you. You show up and ask me if I want to get a drink. We walk to the pub across the road and sit by a window overlooking the bus stop. I pay for the drinks, but you go to the bar as I'm not old enough. \n\nYou sit down and we talk about our exams. And then, out of nowhere:\n\n\"Do you think this is working?\"\n\nMy honest answer would have been no. You have such a huge personality and I feel overwhelmed by it. I can rarely think of anything to say, because you and your family are all so similar and I feel like I'm boring. \n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nYou proceed to break up with me. It's not me, of course, it's you. This isn't permanent, it's a \"break\". You're not comfortable in your own head, you can't deal with the silences. \n\nOf course, that makes little sense, as we don't spend a lot of time together. Why are my silences so much worse than the ones when you're alone? I don't understand and I want to ask why, but I can't find my voice. I just concentrate on getting to the bottom of my glass. \n\n***\n\nI'm on the bus home and I let a few tears escape. We're staying friends and I have to seem OK with that. \n\n***\n\nI get home and tell my mum I have a cold. I go to bed, but I don't sleep. I don't sleep for three days. It feels like someone has punched me in the chest. It hurts to breathe.\n\n***\n\nI'm sitting on my computer in late June and I see a picture of you and the girl you took to your prom. Is she the reason why you ended it? I feel sick. \n\n***\n\nIt's November and I've barely seen you since we broke up. You've been avoiding me. You ask me if I want to get a drink after college. I accept, because I want to be your friend. \n\nWe drink and drink and drink. We catch up. We leave. I'm seventeen and I'm drunk and I still love you. I lose my cool. I shout at you for calling it a break just so that I'd stop opposing the break up. It was a shitty thing to do. I cry. You cry. We kiss. \n\n***\n\nA few weeks later you ask me if I want to get back together. I say no. I'm seeing someone. That doesn't work out and for a long time I regret turning you down, but really nothing had changed and the end result would have been the same. \n\n***\n\nI believe that love is never the same twice. I could look back on this now, almost seven years since I first met this guy, and I say that I never loved him. I could say that I was just a young girl who was infatuated with a boy. That would be a disservice. Just because I have loved since, and loved differently, doesn't mean that what I felt wasn't love. Those feelings were real and when I look back I can feel it all. It was \"teenage love\" and it was filled with hormones and paranoia, innocence and hope. The heartbreak taught me to be strong, but it also taught me to be cynical. I have never loved like that since, I have never allowed myself to become so vulnerable so quickly. I learned to build walls and I became a fortress. \n\nStill, I love every single one of those memories; the good and the bad. I love thinking of them, and feeling like I'm right back there. I love the explosive happiness of our first kiss; the calming warmth of him holding me; the earth-shattering feeling of him ending things. They're fond memories with a friend I still hold dear, and I wouldn't change a second of it. "

Now, she has horrible anxiety attacks anytime he is ever brought up. Today, at my local library, me and here were hanging out, and he showed up randomly. Immediately after showing up, he said he was going to leave. I asked her if she wanted to leave, and she said yes. So we were, but she was breaking down already. She went into the girls' bathroom and was in there for a few minutes. I decided that I should go in there and comfort her. I walked right in there (there was another girl at the sink that didn't notice me) and crawled under the stall that she was in. I held her while she cried, and I told her that everything was going to be okay, and that time was the only thing that could ever fix it. Not me, nor her boyfriend, nor anybody else. Just time. So we were there for quite a while, and it had just dawned on me when we were walking out that I was in the girls restroom (a felony for a guy) the whole time, talking to her and comforting her. And that's the same moment that I realized that I really do love her. \n\nTL;DR This girl I know had an anxiety attack, and I comforted her in the girls' bathroom, only to find out exactly where I was, and to find out that I have loved her for a long time now.\n\nMORAL: Love makes you do stupid things."

He further went on to say that not only is the Pope fallible, but so too are ecumenical councils and synods. According to him, \"the Church,\" is the only infallible institution. Basically he said that if something becomes accepted by all of the Church over time and after many synods/councils, then we can know it is infallible. \n\nThis just seems so illogical and nonsensical. How then can we verify anything we know now is true? And as if to add salt to the theological wound, he made the sun-heat-light analogy for the trinity (*oh Patrick*).\n\nHe also said that marriage was not necessarily for procreation, but in order to help \"burn the flesh\" of people who have lustful desires. That can't be right though, because then we would have to also allow homosexual marriages if the only purpose of it is to satisfy your sexual urges in a safe environment. He also mentioned the Vatican being a state, but the Papal States were established over 300 years before the schism. There's also no history of the national church model. He ended by talking about conspiracy theories, a one world government, and how ecumenism will bring about the End Times. \n\nI'm just so fed up with elaborate mysticism that completely ignores reason and rationality. Never mind the fact that the congregation itself is the textbook definition of lukewarm Christian. Thus I've decided to convert to Catholicism. Please pray for me. Thank you."

We knew each other in HS, but had little interaction since we were in different years. I was good friends with her older brother though, who was 2 years my elder.  After graduating she and I returned to our HS to speak at a panel for seniors, telling them what to expect in your first years of college, etc.  We hung out after the panel, ended up going to get coffee or something (10 yrs ago) and went to the park for a few hours, walking and talking.  We went back to my place and made out for a while, nothing too serious, you know.  BTW this was taking place during the holidays, I was home from college.  So we part ways shortly there after, she went to her college and I to mine.  We had some contact over the years via facebook, but not much.  \nEarly this September, I get a random message from her on facebook, \"hey _______ whats up? how have you been?\" or something along those lines.  Well let me tell you something.  I have been in love a couple of times in my life, was even engaged for a while so this aint my first rodeo, and what I have gone through the past couple of months is something like I have never experienced before.  Keep in mind we havent seen each other in a decade.  We talk about anything and everything, understand one another eerily well.  We are both artists and understand the sacrifices/hardships one has to make to maintain this career.  We see eye to eye and have a profound trust that feels so natural its almost taken for granted.  We talk on the phone everyday, txt throughout the day, skype when its possible.  We have built a foundation through these means only, and are completely in love with one another.  There will be many nay-sayers out there and thats ok, I am not looking for affirmation or anything, just wanted to share this with you because I feel like its the best thing in my life right now. \nThe one issue is that she lives 2000 miles away!! I am finishing grad school in May and have never been so motivated in my life.  I will see her for the first time in Ten years in December, for three weeks.  She loves me deeply, Reddit, and I know this.  I love her too.  What do you think?  If all goes as splendidly well as I think it well in December, should I relocate to her state in the name of Love after I graduate?  I have a decent job where I am, but in my field I can go to any major city and do ok.  She is in a great city for the arts by the way, Its just on the other side of the country. Before you say to me, \"whatch out man, you have no idea whats going on\" I will say this:\nI am a Trigenarian, have loved and lost and lost at love.  I know myself well after these failed relationships and have a good idea of what makes a relationship work.  Any input you have will be appreciated, although, \"I do what i Want!! \"  If anyone cares Ill keep you updated on the development of this love story.  My prediction is, I will be married by this time next year, and that sounds perfect to me.  Its game changer time Reddit! \n-Love,\nYerbal\n"

I asked if they were hungry and they looked into my eyes nodding their heads indicating a desperate yes.  There was a man selling some indian food called Wada & Bun so I took a few and gave them.

There are some circumstances in her life that prevent us from ever being together, although I'm certain she has some very strong feelings for me.

She stopped by to exchange Christmas gifts yesterday and while we were standing in the cold talking about what the future holds for us in our careers, I realized that I could, quite accurately, put a number on the remaining amount of times I will see this woman in my life. It breaks my heart a bit.\n\n23 at best."

            "value": "Hey there, reddit!  \n\n    \n\nI want to share the weird ride I've been on for the past few weeks, so please bear with me...  \n\n    \n\n\n\n\nI'm 27 (male), she's almost 28, and we've only been seeing for a few weeks at this point, and yet... I think she might be the one!  \n \n\n    \n\n    \n\nI'll start my story with a little history -  \n\nI've always been a little shy and sometimes socially awkward. I've always had good friends, but had a really hard time approaching girls. This changed quit a bit in the last few years, due to some change in atmosphere (different circle of friends, different personal focus), and largely thanks to my first serious relationship, at the age of 26 (I've had GFs before, but nothing that lasted more than 2-3 months). \n\nThis last relationship lasted about a year, and was terminated by me, because it got a little too much for me. We were already living together at my old apartment, about to move to a bigger one, and my Ex started using ultimatums to get me to marry her. This, along with some long-held doubts I already had, led me to the decision to leave and look for \"real love\". I wanted to find a relationship where I would just know \"this is it, she's the one\", rather than making a rational decision to \"do the right thing and settle down\"...  \n\n    \n\n\n\nOne more thing to note about me is that I pretty much wrote the book on self-control and rational reasoning. I tend to use my rational decision making skill for 99% of the choices I have to make, and very very rarely do my emotions get to lead the way. I have been seeing a therapist for about six moths now, regarding this issue (among others), and we've been making some progress.  \n\n\n\n    \n\nNow back to my story - \n\nIt's been a little over 3 months since that relationship ended, and I've gone on a quite few dates in that time. It was enough to boost my confidence somewhat, and I did have a few good experiences along the way, but it's not something I'd like to make into a habit. \n\n    \n\nEnter my new love - \nBasically, this girl entered my life like most of my recent dates - brief online flirts, then a few phone calls, followed by a face-to-face date. \nI could already tell she was cool and open minded from our online interactions, and I was happy when she didn't show any signs of disapproval when I shared my appreciation for the geeky side of life (there was a big scifi con where I live at the time, and I wanted to share my experiences).  \n\nWhen we had our first date, I was just smitten - she was gorgeous, interesting, and simply better than I expected on every parameter...  To be honest, I was just flattered she entertained the idea of dating me...  \n\nOne thing that kind of hurt my outlook on our chances was that there was absolutely no physical contact, hand holding, etc. on that date (mostly due to my fear of rejection). I called her the next day, expecting to get denied a second date, but try I did - AND SHE SAID YES!  \nOur second date was unbelievably awesome, and I really went all out - I got her a rose, took her to the best restaurant I could find, and made an effort to be romantic. That date ended with a kiss, and I was as happy as I could be.  \nFrom that point on, something within me changed. I don't let her on to this too much yet, and whenever we're together I can keep my cool, but when I'm on my own it's as if I'm a 15yo schoolgirl with a crush. I can't stop daydreaming, and my emotions pretty much run me. I went from showing and having next to no emotions, to having full-on, deep feelings, and even the occasional tears of joy when I'm on my own...  \n\n     \n\nI know how crazy this sounds, but I think this girl will someday be my wife! This is the very first time I really saw myself marrying someone, let alone having these ideas so early on.  \n\n\n      \n\nOn the rational side of things, all the technical requirements seem to be fulfilled - \n\nWe're attracted to each other, we have some common interests, we get along fairly well, we're both at an age where that is a valid option in a few years, and I think we both played the field enough to be ready to commit when the time comes. \n\n\n\n      \n\non the emotional side, there's just no denying what I'm feeling, even though it's surely closer to the realm of an infatuation than deep love, at least at this point...\n\n\n\n      \n\nReddit - what are your thoughts?  \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\nTL;DR - After a lot of hardship, I met an amazing girl, which I hope to marry one day, even though we have only been seeing each other for a few weeks.\n\n\n   \nEDIT: typos, formatting"

My last class of the day for that whole year was a subject called \"High School Success\". In this class I learned about how to successful in High School. I also found out about the do's and don'ts as well.\n\nI remember my first day so clearly. I was so self-conscious and nervous, especially when I heard about the hazing of the new freshman where the seniors would throw them into trashcans on the first Friday of the year. That didn't help very much.\n\nWhen I was walking into my sixth period class I saw a girl. The second I laid eyes on her, I stopped in the middle of the doorway and just froze. When she laid her eyes upon me my heart stopped and it felt like I was sitting on cloud nine. She smiled and chuckled a little bit. I think in some way she knew I thought she was beautiful.\n\nWe all had assigned seats and mine was closest to the door and hers was more towards the opposite side of the classroom. Ever so often we would have seat changes and every time that happened I hoped and prayed I would get assigned next to her desk, but almost every time, I was never the lucky one to be sitting right next to her.\n\nEventually I did get assigned to a sit that was right behind hers. We were sitting on the opposite side of the classroom against the wall. I usually got there first before her or she before me. When I got there first I was so nervous. I didn't know how to talk to her.\n\nI can't remember who spoke first, but I'm positive she said something first and after that we just became friends. We were sometimes partners and group members together if we ever had a project that required it. I really enjoyed those moments.\n\nI wanted to tell her how I felt so many times, but I feared the possible rejection, so I didn't say anything.\n\nThere were a couple of times where I mustered up some courage and tried to tell her. The first time was at lunch. I had seen she was over by the vending machines by herself.\n\nI figured it was the right moment to say something, that way if she didn't feel the same way, no one would witness the rejection. Call me gutless, but it is what it is.\n\nAs I was getting close to her I saw a guy go up to her and hugged her, she hugged back too. Not only that, but they kissed.\n\nMy heart sunk. It felt like someone punched and kicked it.\n\nShe dated this guy for a little while and they did break up, quite frankly the guy was a jerk and didn't treat her very well. I still never mentioned my feelings to her. The second time I tried telling her was in class near the middle of the third semester.\n\nBut I found out she was talking with some guy and they too dated, but that only lasted until the middle of the last semester. High school relationships am I right?\n\nNow we are at the end of freshman year. Your boy never told this girl how he felt.\n\nI never saw her again because she switched schools. Sophomore and junior year we did talk on and off, but only through texting. We did speak a little during my senior year, but that was it.\n\nShe actually told me that at some point she had feelings for me. If only she knew I had feelings for her...\n\nI did date other girls, but I never felt the way towards them that I did towards the girl I am talking about. Those relationships were short-term and obviously didn't last.\n\nIt's now six years later and that same girl never leaves my mind. For some reason I can't move on. I don't know why I'm so stuck on this girl for this long.\n\nI regret not telling her how I felt about her and wondering what if. I kick myself over it sometimes. A few months ago I looked her up on Facebook and messaged her using the Facebook Messenger app.\n\nFinally I told her how I felt. It's not the way I wanted her to find out; I needed to get this off my chest.\n\nShe had read the message, but didn't respond.\n\nIt hurt me. Really bad.\n\nI probably sound crazy, but I'm certain that I love this girl to this day. There are some nights where I dream about us being together and I even had one of us getting married. Super weird.\n\nRecently I was cleaning out my desk drawer and found one of my school I.D.'s from my freshman year. On the back she had written \"logan loves danette ;)\". I forgot about that.\n\nMakes me wonder if she knew all along how I felt.\n\nShe's certainly was the one that got away.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: \nI recently contacted her and it turns out that she does have a boyfriend. \n\nI believe it's time to close this chapter.

I later posted asking for bible recommendations.\n\nI haven\u2019t been an active poster because I\u2019ve been busy either studying, working, attending church or reading my new bible - and praying too (though I admit, I still feel very strange doing it). \n\nI just wanted to say that, after having admitted in my first post that I was once very hostile to religion, I was expecting animosity from you. I thought asking for bible recommendations would be met with mockery. As someone who had next to no exposure to Catholicism, or religion in general, throughout my life, posting on here (even though anonymous) was uncomfortable for me.\nI\u2019m glad that I did, and I\u2019m grateful that you responded. \n\nI met with a priest yesterday to discuss what\u2019s been going on, and he\u2019s not pushy at all \u2013 he\u2019s given me bible passage recommendations and is teaching me how to pray the rosary (even though he must be very busy, the whole experience has been very encouraging).\n\nConsider me humbled, r/Catholicism. I grew up being told that religion (and Catholicism in particular) was corrupt, even evil. Yet, I\u2019ve found myself surrounded by meaning and kindness. I don't feel so empty anymore.\n\nSo, thanks. \n"

You suddenly found me attractive and worth\nspeaking to after two or three years of going to the same college, having the same friends, going to the same parties, ecetera.\nI spent months trying to figure you out, and you spent those same months vying for my attention/affection. Eventually, we both found our common ground and began to build something. \n\nYou took me to a party with people I barely knew, and I stuck by your\nside to avoid feeling like an outcast. We played beerpong and won, we ate jello shots and drank, and we returned to your\napartment and cuddled. It wasn't the sex, or the pot, or your playful nature that won me over. As we slept in your bed, you shifted onto your side in the middle of night. Before you drifted back to sleep,\nyou turned and planted the softest kiss on my shoulder. I remember being half awake, feeling equally elated and confused\nby this gesture. I never experienced anything like that before. But something happened at that moment: My body relaxed,\nI smiled, and my heart skipped a beat. I became truly infatuated with you. \n\nThat was a year ago. You still do the very same thing: Turn over in your sleep, never fully awake. Every now and then,\nyou plant a kiss on some part of my body. It is sincerely my favorite thing that you do. Whenever I feel you stir at night,\nif I am semi-concious, I curl up next to you in anticipation. \n\nIn your arms, I am home. You hold me in such a way that I have no desire to let go. I can curl into the crook of your arm\nand feel the most comfort I have felt in years. I can feel your chest rise and fall, and it can lull me to sleep with ease.\nI can feel your lips on the tip of my head, and your arms tighten around me as if you were afraid I would float away if\nyou didn't hold me firmly to your body. I have never felt any of this. And now I know that this is home. \n\nHome is not a physical manifestation like a house or a city. Home is a feeling. It is the feeling that your heart is firmly set in \nplace, the feeling of safety, and the feeling of happiness wherever you go. Sometimes the wind will rattle those\nwindows or extinguish the power for an hour, a day, a week. No matter. If it's a real home, it will hold up. If you have the right\ntools, you can rebuild it. \n\nI don't want to lose my home. I thought I understood what that was like when I moved away for college four years ago.\nHowever, you eventually deal with it. You grow and establish yourself a new residence. I never understood the fear of \nlosing a home until I imagined a place without you. And the thought breaks my heart or threatens to snap it in half. \nAnd so I am always cleaning house, furnishing it, adding new things. This is why I still have some insecurities.\nThis is why I still have few nightmares of a girl, 3000 miles away, taking you away from me. This is why I try so hard, but\nalways cry at the thought of failing. I don't want my foundation to fall apart. \n\nI know that things may not last. I know not to expect everything for the future. But I can tell you now that the work\nI've done is the best I've done in a very long time. Your arms are the only home I need, and they give me a glimmer of\nhope that wherever I go, I will never be lost. I am in love with my home, no matter how run down it may be after sometime. \nThat will never change. \n"
