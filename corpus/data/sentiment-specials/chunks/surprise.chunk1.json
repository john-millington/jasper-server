I need to share just how faithful God is. I will start with my first miracle that happened to me while I was being created! Please understand I have to be raw in my stories as much as I don't want to be. Once you start reading as time goes on you will eventually understand the importance. First Story.. when my Mother was 3 months pregnant with me she got Rubella (German measles). My Father was in the Army and they were stationed to Germany. This is where the miracle begins. In the United States mothers pregnant with the German measles at that time they were aborting the babies! Due to major defects the measles caused to the embryo. Being in Germany saved my life. God kept me so safe from disfigurement, blindness& deafness. I am deaf in my right ear that's it!! Had I been born deaf my whole path of life would have been so different! Most likely my children would not be here nor of course, my grandchildren. God had a plan. Things get real dark in the middle of my life. I will continue tommorrow plz come back this is truly an interesting life story. God is seen everywhere and Satan's plot is obvious! \nPOST #2:\nI had a great childhood!! Although when i started school it was difficult for me to make friends. I watched other ppl a lot. I noticed noone would befriend the poor kids. But, I would! I would almost cry when I would see a small child wearing glasses it just broke my child heart. I had a tender heart but I was also a little brat. I did not like milk and I remember spilling my milk over everyday in kindergarten. The teacher punished me by not allowing me to participate in taking the little red wagon and going to get the milk and passing it out to the class. I just kept spilling my milk. I never could put the two together ...if I wouldn't spill milk I would have been able to participate. As a child I was loving and followed my big sister a lot! Christmas was always great at our home. My Mother would sew us dresses and I loved that . Barbie dolls were my favorite. Then as I got a little older I began to read my bible and study and memorize scripture for girls auxiliary at church. When I was in the fifth grade I learned Jesus was coming back for me one day. I was so excited I told the bus driver, the teachers, the principle everyone I could. So, I was a witness at a young age. I had a love for Jesus I kept him close. Then I grew up and fell away. Although I fell away I still talked to him a lot!! During Jr high and high school I didn't have boyfriends. I never went to a prom. Never went to a dance. Boys were not attracted to me, but I think I was fine.\nI didn't know anything about sex until 15 years of age. I was working at a sports dress shop in Panama City beach. One day a group of college kids came in shopping. One of the boys ask me out for dinner. Well I was only 15 and not allow to date. Just a couple of days later my Father's mother passed away. My parents went to North Carolina to her funeral. So. That was my chance to go out. Somehow I ran into the same fellow I suppose he must have come back to where I was working. I accepted a date. I went over my parents authority . Well I thought it to be pretty innocent. He was staying at a motel with a diner . He was with his coach and football team. I felt safe. So, we set a time for me to meet with him. When I arrived i ask one of his teammates where he was. They said for me to go inside the motel room and they would go get him. I did and was sitting on the couch in the room. Suddenly, the room filled up with the football team and they picked me up and began to undress me. I was so scared and didn't know what they were doing or why. I kept looking around amidst all the guys I never did see the guy I was there to see. Each one of them had their turn with me. There was one guy lying on a cot bed ,I kept pleading with him to help me. He refused and said \"nope, I'm just waiting on my turn\". I have to say once this was over with several years passed I had a real hard time forgiving that guy!. In the middle of the rape storm, someone went and got the guy I was there to see he came in put me in the bathroom and started busted heads together, he was crying and in shock as I was. When he cleared the room I was finally able to walk out. As I came out of the room a grown man I suppose the coach was just leaned back in a chair right outside of the room! It was very hard to forgive him too. All I can say about this is God protected me from any diseases and pregnancy. I never told a soul about this until I wad 32 years old. One day my little girl she was 5, we were at the Panama City mall and suddenly I saw as guy who I thought looked like one of those guys and I panicked . I grabbed her in my arms and went straight to my parents house. It was time to tell my parents. Well, my mom was at work and my dad was home. It was hard to tell him but i had to. Shortly after this I started drinking. I was well established in church a youth minister with my kids Father...and I started drinking. That decision caused me and my whole family more drama and pain we could not bear.\nPOST#3:\nThe plot on my family; My family we were doing good until I had let my sin rule me. When I started drinking the alcohol took me pretty quickly. Little did I know that satan and his demons had me& my family as one of there main courses. Their plot was to \"kill, steal and destroy our family. My childrens Father had to go to work out of town. This removed my \"protector\", the husband from our home. Once he was removed the plan of destruction was set in moition. I began to go to bars I was 34 yrs old. My first bar experience. I enjoyed the social life of it all. I had one foot in church and one foot on the Devils den. God will not be mocked. In the bible in the book of James chapter one he tells us that a double minded man is unstable in all of his ways. That I was. I completely changed my ways. My children had a great mom until alcohol. My interest was going out to ladies night , clubbing, partying. I thought I was under control! I had this I can juggle my children, consume alcohol and church. We were pillars in the church! My kids Father warned me he told me \" Brenda, you don't have any idea what your tampering with\". But, you can't tell a fool anything. \nMy first huge despair came when my oldest daughter had her first school dance. We had planned to go get her a dress and have her hair fixed have fun while preparing for the dance. She woke me the morning we were to go shopping. I was too hung over to get out of bed! She called my Mother and of course mom came through for her. I missed the whole event! I was disgusted and enbrassed but not enough to stop the madness oh no, I was unaware caught in a trap. Satan's plan was just moving along very smoothly. I kept playing on the evil pathway until one day I just walked out on my family. Gone I was. I was gone for fourteen years. I lost everything and everybody most of all I lost respect from my kids. When I walked out I had no idea the people in this world were so selfish. Mean and nasty people. A different company than what I had been use to. It's one thing to flirt with evil it's another when evil demonic enter in your spirit. They had me my childrens mother and my husband's wife. My parents daughter. My spirit was shoved down too the soles of my feet and the demon that entered me had a new home. I lived on the streets not a prostitute I refused to sell out. There was the only moral I had left. When I walked I walked from town to town city to city. Men when they saw me walking they would offer me a ride. After walking so much you will get in the car just to rest. Many times I was treated like I owed them something for the ride. Several times I was taken down lonely trails of roads and was raped. Several times I knew death had me. One particular ride I had taken there were two men in the car I was tired I had walked miles that day. As I got in the car they ask me to lock the back door where I was sitting. That was very strange. Then I noticed they kept silently leering at one another. Weird and trouble. I knew the road I was on and ahead was a lot of woods. As I sat in their car watching the weird behavior I realized these guys could rape snd kill me. They seemed very capable. As we approached the only store on that street for miles ahead I said to them \" please I'm thirsty stop at this store I will buy us at drink\". Oh, they were leary to stop but they did. I wasted no time getting away from them . When if entered the store the two men were still outside. Standing at the cash register was one of the biggest guy I had ever seen. Ty Jesus. I walked up to him placed my hand in his arm and ask him to help me . I told him those guys were giving me a ride and I was scared. So, when those guys walked into the store they came directly up to me demanding for me to get back in the car. My huge \"guardian angel\", told them I was his friend and they better leave immediately. They just looked at me in a awful manner. God saved me again. The man who saved me took me to a friends house. That incident was not enough to stop my walking. I had 14 years of this ahead of me. Like I wrote earlier I had been possessed unbenounced to me. I went for therapy many times. I knew there was something abnormal going on with me but I did not understand. I was pitiful. Two weeks after I had left my 17 year marriage he my ex was already in love and i ask him if I could come home. Not a chance. So i walked to the beach by the water. It was so peaceful. I would sit and write my kids name in the sand time and time again. I became very lonely my dark journey had only just began.\nPOST #4:\nThroughout those 14 years of walking ,running from myself there was much darkness, sadness, a mother without her children and children without their Mother. These days are very tough to look on. I have many stories of horror etc...I will share just a few more of the madness I went through. I saw an ad in the Panama City classified ads a job opportunity. It was in Mobile Ala. I took a bus the man that I set the interview up with picked me up at the bus station. As we were headed to the office, I looked down at his shoes while he was driving and i noticed he has on a blue shoe and a brown shoe. Immediately I knew something wasn't right about this man. So. He announced to me \"oh dear. I've put on the wrong shoe I need to go back to my apartment and change my shoes. My thoughts were not good I knew he possibly had me in a trap. So, we go to the apartment and he offered for me to come in. I did. Well nothing happened. So I was relived\nWe never went to the office. The job was selling windows. So he takes me to neighborhoods and I was to observe the process. I did but I was not comfortable with him. As the day progressed he mentioned a dating service he also owned and ask would I be interested in pursuing night work with his service and learning the window sales at the same time. I declined and when he stopped at a store to purchase something, i left out of his car went to the highway and began hitchhiking. I wanted away from him immediately. So, I got a ride to a real nice park in Mobile. As I strolled through the park I notice all the ppl. There was a skinny black man very fine dressed in a brown pinstriped suit. I approached him and ask does he know of a place close by I could get a glass of wine. The man looked deeply in my eyes and said \"Jesus is the wine you drink from his well and you will never thirst again\"! Well I knew that scripture but I was tired and just wanted to sit and have glass of wine. So, i continued walking for quite a longway. I came across a bar that had a sign free bbq today. So, I hid my bag of clothes in the bushes and went in got a glass of wine and a plate. While I was sitting alone, suddenly a man comes in with my bag and holds it up and loudly ask if it belonged to anyone in there\nI humbly arose got my bag and looked about the room to see if anyone was paying attention. Yep, one person. He made his way over to my table. He ask if I was alright. He seemed nice. He offered to take me somewhere else. I told him I was looking for a better atmosphere and I didn't know mobile. He took me down a long woody path. I thought to myself he is going to kill me. I prayed that my parents would find my i.d. I ask God not to let my body be lost. He hears my prayer. After the guy did what he did to me he collapsed on me crying. I just held him and told him that \"God, loves you\"!!\nHe said his many apologies to me and dropped me off at a Irish pub. My mind was in a state of horror and I didn't want to be noticed. The bar tender ask me what drink did I want and as the bartender looked at me and I at him..oh my goodness there stood my cousin I've not seen since childhood. God giving me a way of escape. But, after visiting my cousin there he was so busy I left. I was back on the lonely roads again. Late that evening I was in a dance club. I was talking to a couple told them about why I was in Mobile.\nI knew my kids Dad wasn't letting me go back home so i ask the couple did they know of any places reasonable to rent. They did. They took me to a place pretty far out in the country to a trailer. It was where they used to live and let me stay there and they would get back with me the next day. The very next morning I awoke being in the country. They never came back. I started walking. I did not know which way to go at the end of the driveway. As I stood there accessing what to do....and pack of wild dogs came out of the woods there were about 6 or 7. I stood still I was petrified. It was hot I knew they were going to see me and smell my scent. I prayed the scripture 1st Peter 5:7 \"Cast all your care on him for he caret for you\"! Those wild dogs weren't but about 40 feet from me. One of them looked right at me but it appeared to me he could not see me. I knew Jesus was with me. After the dogs went across the street behind a trailer I left slowly. That road was a good twenty miles from any civilization. It was a hot summer day. I just kept putting one foot in front of the other. I saw this little old lady at her mail box her place was the only house after miles of walking. She was standing at her mail box and I ask her for a glass of water she said \"no\", I knew I had to keep going I began to hear traffic which was interstate road. Oh, was I tired and now I was on the interstate. I kept walking. This man driving a electric company nice truck ask me if needed a ride, I Said yes. I'm sure it was obvious that I was exhausted. He ask where I was going I told him to Hardee's to get breakfast. He said I will buy you breakfast, if you will give me some of what you got. I demanded him to stop the truck and let me out. He did. Now, this man was married he had a ring on. I thought , my Father must be the only true man in this life!! As i was back on the interstate that man came back with a Hardee's bag and apologized he ask what is my destination I said the bus station. Without incident he took me there. Mobile experience was a bad one but good too. First I met an angel in the park. I saw my cousin and Jesus hid me from a pack if wild dogs. His Faithfulness to us is amazing. I was the lost sheep without a doubt. I stayed with a friend for a few weeks and found work. I was hired by a staffing company. The owner said I was the best representative her office ever had. I am good with the employers and good with the customers looking for jobs. I made good job placements and good money!! I thought I was back on track in life. One day at work my boss called me back to her office she said she had something she wanted to show me. Well, she had a heating pad under her blouse. She ask me do I know why she had the heating pad on her chest of course I had no I had a why. She pulled out the heating pad and she had six morphine patches across her chest. I was flabbergasted! She chuckled and said I just want you to know im on drugs and I'm going to a treatment center. So her business will be closed until she gets back. I there again left on foot. I headed for Panama City Beach to the bar. Then I rented a motel room. I began to help a painter friend. I hate painting. But, at least I was working. A couple wanted to iwnroduce me to a friend of theirs who was single. We met. When he found out I was living in a motel room he offered me a room at his place. He gave me the master bdrm. He slept on the couch. He showed me respect. I then got a better job and he purchased me and phone. He called me too much during the day. But, at least I was off the street. After 6 months of living with him I had all my little grandchildren and my youngest daughter over to visit. My son soon met him and they got and long good. I was not in love just safe. So I talked to him and discussed marriage. I did not want to live with a man in front of my children. We got married. A nice ceremony with all my family present. Oh boy, I had stability. Nevermore to roam. Well.it didn't take long for his jealousy to start acting out. Anytime I was in the Prescence of another man he got jealous. His own insecurities showing face. He came home one day and his mouth was moving back and forth so fast. I was sitting at my computer when I noticed his odd behavior. I ask him if he was high. He yelled no!! Shot, my computer. Ok now what...if didn't. Want to be on the streets again so. I tried to stay calm. The next morning I was getting ready for work, I was in the shower and suddenly a gallon of white paint was poured on me. White paint in my hair for at least 6 months. I went on with my day and after work I went shopping white paint in hair. I bought 750.00 dollars worth of new clothes a couple of new pairs of shoes. When it went to work the next day in came home and all my clothes and shoes were all slashed with a carpet knife. In situations like this you try not to perturbe the irate drugged person. Just go an out your business and wait for the right escape. I told him he owed me money for my clothes and went to bed. I was almost asleep when acnoutlm bucket of water was poured on me, he pulled me out of bed acnoutlm began kicking me up against the bed. I layer there pretending to be passed out. When he left the room I snuck out the bedroom window and ran as fast as I could he was very dangerous. I slept on the sand dunes that night.Gods unfailingly love for me, I later found out he was on meth!! I also knew he changed a lot , anger and violence had made a home in him. I'm very fortunate and protected by God to have survived his antics. I had not a clue that Gods plan for me was in action on May 31, 2003, I woke up on the sand dunes. I will never forget that day. I started walking on the beach and this beach bum came walking with me. As we we were walking I heard.the.Holy Spirit given me instructions. Belive it or not he told me to go to the beach house which was action least 6miles. Well, I was a telling the beach bum to go away and leave me acctiontwlone to no avail. The Holy Spirit kept repeating the same message to me, but I did not want to go to the beach house it's a bar. All I could think is in that place there would just be the same people sitting in the same chairs, talking about the same thing. It made no sense to me why he wanted me there. The beach bum was still walking with me ,he ask where am I going. I finally said \"to the beach house\", and just as soon as I said that a friend of the beach bum pulled up and ask him where is he headed to get replied I needed a ride to the beach house. That saved me a walk. When his friend dropped us off I wanted him to go with his friend not with me. He refused he said he liked my company. I strictly told him \" I aqua intend this bar and I always come alone and leave alone. I told him to keep his distance because he began having flirty eyes. I bought me away glass of wine and him a beer. Then , I look across the bar this man was sitting with a friend drinking their beer. SUDDENLY, I SAW THE MOST BEAUTIFUL.SPIRIT IN THIS MAN\nLIKE NOTHING I'VE SEEN IN MANY YEARS, IF EVER! I WAS MEMORIZED. NOT AT HIS LOOKS, I NEVER PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HIM I JUST SAW A PEACEFUL BEAUTIFUL SPIRIT. I COULDN'T TAKE MY EYES AWAY. IN THE MEANTIME THE GUY I WAS SEEING HIS SPIRIT NOTICED ME STARING...HE HAD NO IDEA WHY I WAS STARING. Well the beach bum noticed me staring and suddenly tried to kiss me. I grabbed his beer and sat him behind me after a few words I had to say to him. Finally, I'm sitting alone and the Holy Spirit ask me very softly and gently said to me, \"just go meet him\". The beautiful spirited man. I freaked out and left. I walked out and here comes the beach bum I told him to keep moving on. \nMany wonderful things are about to change in my life.\nPost #5:\nYou might wonder if God will speak to someone in the midst of an evil path in life. Absolutely I am a living witness to his word. He says \"I will never leave you\". I will never forsake you. I will walk with you in the valley of death. I will leave my flock for one astray. I served him for many years. I just didn't grasp his word like I do now. The Holy Spirit, Jesus and God my Father knew my terrible decisions and mistakes I would make in life before he appointed a time for me to be born. Because I left my family I've lived in shame and shock over this decision. I've paid deeply for my sin. His word tells us we reap what we sow. Oh, yes we do. It took over ten years to restablish family ties and trust. I've dug deep in his word I've learned so much on deep levels. God's plan for me are strange. But, I'm in this life to win over my faults and self unforgiveness. I have been given visions, dreams from God. In my journies I will be sharing about all these marvelous events. Some seem unrealistic. I will share about being still and knowing He is God\nIf you have read any of these writings you may wonder how I ever can be still but I have learned . Whew. I will share about when my son was stabbed and cut open from tit. to navel. Please bare with me I'm not a writer unfortunately. I really need an author. Anyway, I hope things aren't to choppy. I will try to make sense in all of this. I request prayer for myself. I've noticed since I've started writing I do experience some stress. I hate stress. I pray the Holy Spirit will help me write. Ty friends. Try not to judge me."

I didnt talk to him for over a year because of that. \n\nA second talk happened in much the same fashion, maybe 6 months or so after I started talking to him again. Things in his life had gone down hill. The house was getting thrashed because he wasn't doing anything other than coming home from work, and drinking. He lost his girlfriend because of it, etc. etc. (She was... Not a good match for him anyways, but thats a whole'nother story.) \n\n(I apologise, timelines have gotten fuzzy. Not super relevant to the story anyway.) A couple of months after that, I recieved a phonecall from my grandma saying that my dad was in the hospital because he fell and broke some bones. I found out from him that he fell down the interior stairs in our house, and was found laying in a pool of blood at the bottom of the steps with a broken collar bone, a couple of ribs, and a big gash in his head. (Its weird, but his girlfriend was the one that found him and called the ambulance.) \n\nMore talking. More \"dad, please do something about this. how can I help? do you need anything from me?\" etc. \n\nThen one day, he had a childhood friend of his over. (He actually was trying to not drink, and from what I know, hadnt had a drink in about 2 days when this happened.) While his friend was over, he became very disoriented, was having cold sweats and almost uncontrollable shakes, so his friend called the ambulance. \n\nIt was after this, that he decided to have the hospital get him into treatment. They did. And now here we sit. Over a year sober. I couldn't be more proud! I have a dad again :)  \n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your thoughts and well wishes! I was totally not expecting such a response, I was just getting some feelings out. Thank you thank you thank you! I apologize for formatting and all of that. Im not the best writer in the world, and I tend to type how I think.   "

I get off work and decide to wait for the bus instead of biking home. While waiting at the bus stop I notice there is a crew of municipal workers hanging a braided-steel cable from lampposts, and it crosses the street- presumably to hang xmas wreaths/lights over the intersection. A bus approaches the intersection, and no one signals for it to stop, so it California rolls through, and in doing so snagged the cable. This cable was also somehow wrapped around one of the worker's legs. He was dragged about ten feet before the cable sinched tight and took his leg off, leaving him with severe contusions to the head and a severed limb. I sprinted over as I yelled for his dazed coworkers to call an ambulance. I immediately monkey-grip his severed limb at the thigh to delay his arterial hemorrhaging, as his leg(from the knee down) lay in the street four feet from me. The paramedics came 2 mins later and took over, saying he's lucky I squeezed his artery or else death would've been eminent. I stood up from a pool of blood, got my bottle of southern comfort out of my back pack and took a long pull as I waited for detectives to arrive. End result: The guy lived(barring an anomaly) and is going to get a HUGE settlement from the city... And hopefully his leg reattached.\n\nHere is the news article to prove it.\n\nhttp://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/worker-injured-in-county-bus-accident-5077o4t-174179351.html"

I want to share with you a story. I'm a volunteer paramedic. I make $0/hr.\n\nToday, about 1655 CST we were called to a party unconscious for an unknown amount of time. While we were en route (three of us, a rookie, an EMT and myself,) we were told the patient had no pulse and was cold to the touch. Normally, this means they're dead and I expect to pronounce dead on scene.\n\nWe arrive on scene to find a deputy who has informed us he has already called the morgue. Well, we don't fall under his jurisdiction. My partner feels for a pulse, in which there is none. I personally feel the patient and he is still warm to the touch. His eyes have not wrinkled and there is no lividity nor rigor moritis. I decided he is viable.\n\nThe deputy felt differently and shouted at me that I was wrong and that the morgue have already been called. Fuck him.\n\nWe placed the patient on our backboard with compressions already started. I failed at obtaining an IV in the house. We place a King Airway (an airway that is blind insertion and will almost always get proper placement) and it failed. My team and I bring the patient to the squad and there I initiate an IO. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL3DMY1Zln0) I don't know how to make words hyperlinks.... sorry.\n\nThat was successful and I push a round of Epi (adrenaline) into his bone and we continued CPR. I had the experienced EMT drive and the rookie EMT in the back with me. (we all need to learn somehow!)\n\nWhile en route I tried to place an Endotracheal Tube aka ETT (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J3J38se3TQ&amp;NR=1&amp;feature=fvwp) but was unable to, but BVM (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFew8Milqwk) (I know it says two EMT's but it is possible to do it with one, it's just tough) ventilations were adequate enough. A few minutes prior to arriving at the emergency department, the patient was breathing on his own. FUCK YEA! I had the rookie stop CPR so I could analyze the rhythm. VFib. I'm gonna shock the shit out of him. Before I could, he flat-lined again. Damn! We got to the ER and there they were able to ETT him and you know what?\n\nWe all got a pulse back. I found out later that his outcome is looking really really good and that he is expected to leave the hospital in great condition. \n\nI want to share with you my happiness for saving a life and that someday, a paramedic like me (who defies what is known and unknown) will care for you.\n\nEdit: Thanks guys for all of the feedback!! And thanks for the gold! Never got Reddit Gold before!! One of the gals in the ER is also a drinking buddy of mine, she later called me and things now look grim for him. However, that is life and his family will get to have words with him. Love you all!!\n\nEdit 2: There were some questions about me pronouncing dead in the field. That's just the term we use, jargon if you will. We don't actually pronounce dead. It's more of \"There's nothing we can do\" kind of thing. The morticianer is the person who actually delivers a time of death.\n\nEdit 3: In my county, deputies do have the authority to pronounce dead and call for a morgue. He just saw a dead guy and decided no work = no paperwork. Moral of the story, fuck that guy. "
