But the thing I realized is that I am not lowering expectations, although I am generally happy. There are times I mitigate my expectation, internally, but it's very rare that I have high expectations for things, and in this, I am generally a very happy person. However, the next step is like walking through a doorway to consciousness: Don't have any expectations. It is possible that forcing a lack of expectation is not possible, or it might just be a zen like excercise. But when it happens, and you exist without expectation, it isn't just about being happy, but you enter this new flow of existence. The nearest I could describe it is just \"being\". People talk of that in eastern religious / philosophical circles, but the concept is hard to derive, because it is either an overly simplistic notion, or one that is riddled with inaccessibility. So this might be a path.... control expectation by reducing it, and hopefully one can climb over the threshold to simply existing, being, and not having any expectations. I know we're not emotionally consistent beings, and I can have a bad day tomorrow. Or today... but this is something I've been practicing to have it exist somewhat naturally. And that's all I have to say about that."

We can say happiness is this or that, but in terms of life, your life energies are happening in a more exuberant way than it normally happens,\u201d according to yogi, visionary, and thought leader Sadhguru.\nAlthough children are naturally happy with things as simple as an empty box or a bucket of sand and some water, the cost of happiness increases in adulthood, Sadhguru explains. Many adults find that their happiness depends on outside forces, such as relying on someone else, obtaining something else, or engaging in additional activities.\n\u201cEverybody has been happy, but the problem is they\u2019re not able to maintain it,\u201d Sadhguru notes.\n\u201cAll this effort of life, everything that you did \u2014 education, career, business, family, whatever you did \u2014 was in pursuit of happiness. Everything that humanity has done on this planet is in pursuit of happiness,\u201d he observes. But these factors can be seen as externally rather than internally driven.\nBy contrast, another way to achieve sustained, long-term happiness involves starting from the inside. Sadhguru\u2019s latest book, \u201cInner Engineering\u201d offers guidance on how to achieve long-term happiness by focusing on yourself. The role of an Isha yoga practice, as outlined by Sadhguru, is one element in the process of developing sustained happiness.\nIsha yoga can help individuals develop happiness from within by building confidence and health.\nAccording to a recent survey of 536 adults who practiced Isha yoga, 98 percent reported improved mental clarity, 94 percent reported improved inner peace, and 92 percent reported improved emotional balance.\nIn addition, the Inner Engineering course \u201chelps you put your life on self-start so you become in charge of your happiness, joy, and peace,\u201d according to Sadhguru.\nThe course includes guidance on how to manage all aspects of one\u2019s being: mind, body, emotions, and \u201cthe fundamental life energy within.\u201d Interested individuals who have read Sadhguru\u2019s book and taken the Inner Engineering course online may be able to attend in-person classes this spring.\nSadhguru will be conducting Inner Engineering in Spring, 2017, starting on April 29-30 in Tampa, Florida, and May 27-28 in Vancouver, British Columbia.\nFor more information about Sadhguru and Inner Engineering, visit www.innerengineering.com\n\n*DISCLAIMER*\n\nTHIS ARTICLE WAS FROM A NON-COPYRIGHTED WEBSITE THAT DOES NOT COPYRIGHT ITS ARTICLES\n\n\u00a9http://www.copyrightfreecontent.com/\n"

They kept her overnight, and then had some weird results on bloodwork (mainly pregnancy hormones), and when the pediatrician came to see her the next morning the tumour had popped out of wherever it was hiding and she looked about 5 months pregnant.  She had an immediate ultrasound, and although the tech wouldn't say anything, it was pretty easy to see that there were 3 things there that shouldn't be (one large tumour, one very large ovary, and one lymph node). \n\nWe got immediately transferred to an excellent pediatric oncology centre, but because she was so small, and the tumour was so large (it eventually turned out to be the size of a dinner plate), none of the CT scans etc were giving a clear picture of what was going to be involved.  They couldn't do surgery for 3 weeks as they had to stabilize her, but the assumption was that it was likely advanced ovarian cancer, with the strong underlying message that we should probably be starting to think about end-of-life care. \n\nThe surgery was the best day of my life :-)  The surgeon came racing out of the OR, and I've rarely seen a happier man.  They took out the tumour, one ovary/fallopian tube, and one lymph node, and he was very confident that he'd gotten it all, and that she'd be fine.  A few months of chemo, and some recovery time, and she's really never looked back. \n\nNow all that we have to do is have a yearly 'aftercare' checkup, and yearly nephrology and pulmonary checkups to look for long-term effects of her chemo. So far she's great, and given that it was a germ cell tumour, there's very little chance of a recurrence. \n\nBut I still panic a bit before every checkup, so every time we get the all-clear I just want to have a party :-) \n\n\n\n"

People made fun of me because I was quiet, people made fun of me for laughing, people made fun of me for having HAIR ON MY FACE as a girl, people made fun of me for being prude, and people made fun of me for being slutty. The bottom line is, people will never hesitate to slap a label on a person and judge them when they don't know anything about that person's history. I personally was lucky enough to overcome the harsh words of small minded or self- conscious people at a young age, and decided to always love myself no matter what. The important thing to remember about growing up and becoming the person you were born to be is that NOONE ELSE will ever experience life through your eyes, nor you through theirs. Therefore, we should never let the words of another harm our own self-image and affect the way we live our life. If you enjoy doing something, you should be proud of it and enjoy it. In the end of our lives we will only truly regret those things that we did not do. I hope that everyone who reads this can at least at some point enjoy the freedom and joy that comes with being their true, very best self despite the counterproductive and malicious factors that seem to be thrown at us throughout our days.

Currently we are going through a transition stage with new leadership and new work opportunities. This happened on Monday and has me questioning to stay with my employer.\n     Worker A comes in and is summoned to the HR department.  He is told they can no longer alter his schedule on Friday so he may attend church as he has done since he began at the company 7 years ago.  They state they are applying the shift rules evenly to everyone.  He informs them that he accepts their termination and proceeds to his desk, clears his items and leaves.  I was shocked.  Not only at the news of him leaving but why disturb his prayer time over a measly 1.5 hours.\n      About an hour after gentleman A left, gentleman B comes to the desk and says 'did you hear what they did to gentleman A?' Yes.  He goes into the director's office and 10 minutes later walks out to his desk and begins to remove his things.  I walked over and asked him if he was leaving.  He states he can not work somewhere that has no respect for a persons faith.  \n     Gentleman A was a rotten, bitter, and I assume Christian that I did not care for but had no ill will towards. Gentleman B was a very nice, mild mannered Muslim.  They were not friends, they didn't lunch or speak to each other.  Gentleman B taught me the true meaning of solidarity today because he stood with someone purely on the grounds of faith.  He now has me questioning my own desire to stay with this company after 10 years.  \n     What would you do?  I'm in the 'suck-it-up'  and keep working mode; but this really has me on edge for an easy going and nondenominational person.  I could care less about their faith but I care everything about a persons want, desire and ability to practice a faith.  I'm stuck.\n     I am extremely proud of both people.  They have something on top of their list and it does not waver.  Good luck to them in whatever they choose.  See ya later.  B well."

There is no perfect version of anybody, but the never ending pursuit of perfection is key to consistently becoming a more well rounded person. \n\nYou are in total independent control of your own happiness. True happiness is created and maintained according to the ability to control your perspective to avoid fixating on the aspects of your life that you are unsatisfied with, usually beginning with envy of the things that someone else has. If someone spends most their time lusting after things they don\u2019t have, they stop considering the things that others envy of them. To be happy, one must simply focus on remaining constantly grateful and appreciative for all your loved ones and good fortune that currently enrich and define your life. We are all guilty of envious behaviors to varying extents from time to time, but the path to real happiness requires us to cease this behavior whenever possible. For example, John drives a secondhand economy sedan that\u2019s condition could only be described as average if the person rating it had never seen an automobile before, and was also as blind as a bat born without eyes. John looks to his left and sees a spotless foreign sports car that couldn\u2019t be more than a few months old. He thinks to himself, \u201cI would be so happy every day if that was my car.\u201d. Little does John know that there is a woman next to him on a bicycle who is thinking the exact thing about his trusty economy car. Simultaneously, a teenager on the sidewalk wearing worn down sneakers observes the woman and her bicycle, \u201cI could get around the city three times faster if I had a bike like that!\u201d. Unbeknownst to the teenager, someone was envious of his mode of transportation, walking. From the same third story window he sits at every afternoon, Michael looks down at the teenager on the street with a beat up pair of shoes from his wheelchair. \u201cI wish I could walk like he can. I would spend all day just wandering through the alleys and parks, stopping at any random restaurant that I tracked down by smell, and not just ones that are able to give special assistance to the disabled.\u201d. It may seem that the sports car driver is the only person truly happy here, but in his mind he is lusting after the racetrack specified limited edition version of his car. Now you\u2019re probably getting a grasp on what kind of phenomenon is happening here. If everyone was grateful for what they had, especially considering there is always someone less fortunate than you are, each person would have been happy. It\u2019s been said that the only reason to ever look in your neighbors bowl is to see if they have enough, not to see if they have more than you or vice-versa. When you base your happiness upon things like ego, materialism, and social status you will not allow yourself to be happy until you reach a \u201cdestination\u201d such as a larger home, newer car, or \u201cbetter\u201d social circles, you have wrongfully convinced yourself of how to obtain happiness. Since you believe this is where all the joy is at, and you aren\u2019t there yet, then you can\u2019t possibly be happy until then. Unfortunately, there is a chance that you won\u2019t ever reach the destination you set forth as the \u201cbeginning\u201d of your happiness, and therefore deny yourself an entire lifetime of joy and delight for no reason at all, solely because a slight attitude change needed to occur and did not. We\u2019ve all met people that are in a similar situation, they\u2019re the jaded and cheerless individuals that are so convinced that their opportunity to be happy has long since taken flight, that they make no attempts to influence a future full of satisfying moments and deep contentment they can still have. That\u2019s a future that no one wants to end up a part of, but what if you do reach that haven, though? Owning a big house, exotic cars, shiny doodads, and wealthy friends could make anybody smile! Say, after years and years of cheerless struggling you finally make it to your utopian promised land of bliss totally stocked with cool cars, fancy toys, and of course, a house that is uncomfortably large for four people, let alone just you. You sit in the quiet solitude offered by the fruit of your thousands upon thousands of woeful hours toiled, dwarfed by grand ceilings, waiting to be overcome with an unbelievable level of elation you have built up in your mind for ages. Except nothing happens, after all the years that quickly turned to hundreds of relinquished opportunities spent in favor of staying at home alone working late, passing on this potential romance, then blowing off that social event in a misguided attempt to leverage the totality of a decade\u2019s worth of your life into the picture-perfect fantasy that you were sold. You are just as alone now as you were when you chose to stay home while your slowly losing touch friends went out to have experiences, make new connections, and cherish the friendship they have in each other. Your friends are not well-off financially, but they are far wealthier than you when it comes to happiness. While you were building an overpriced empty shell of an existence, they built families, had children, and spent time with each other. Happiness is an ability you develop by fighting off envy, ego, and materialism and acknowledging your gratitude for anything that causes you to be thankful."

            "value": "Showers- Taking luxurious relaxation in cleanliness\n\nMy father used to say that \u2018cleanliness is next to godliness\u2019. While I don\u2019t particularly agree with the assessment that how many times I shampoo my hair relates to some type of divinity, taking happiness in cleaning oneself is definitely something to talk about, since it is something that we all (hopefully) do regularly. Whereas we eventually will talk about baths specifically, today we are going to talk about showering.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about the practical side of things. Showering is a popular method of cleaning your body, and is more common now than a bathtub, as several house/apartments now just come with a stand-up shower as opposed to the classic shower/tub combination. The feeling of water-jets on your skin combined with the heavy pressure allows you to literally feel the dirt and grime coming off your body (and if you are particularly dirty, you can see it coming off\u2026which can be quite satisfying).\n\nThere is also the psychological aspect of showering, that feeling of either washing the night\u2019s sleep away, or washing away your workday, or what have you. A shower can be used to either wake you up in the morning or wind you down at the end of your day, or it can just be used it you feel like it. Once again, there are no rules about when you should (although your loved ones can sometimes make strong recommendations based on body odour of course). When you are feeling sick (particularly with a cold or flu), sometimes nothing can feel as good as a shower, as the steam can help open your sinuses, and cleaning yourself is a good method of \u2018purging\u2019 yourself, so to speak.\n\nThe feeling of the water streaming over your face and body can also offer a degree of relaxation. Some people take the \u2018get in and get out\u2019 approach when it comes to the shower, but others take their time, relishing in the personal time to take it easy. Your shower time is your time to relax and assuming you don\u2019t have a pressing appointment, you can take as long or as little time as you want.\n\nShowers also usually offer some degree of customization, regardless of the technologies that have been placed into them. At the most basic level, you can change the temperature, finding a hot/cold tolerance that you like. Once again, everyone is different, as some people like scalding hot showers, while others prefer much colder ice showers (and again, this can change based on what time of year, what you\u2019ve been doing, or just what you feel like at that moment, etc.). Most shower-heads now also have some degree of modifications to them, at the very least you can change the angle so you don\u2019t have to learn modified yoga positions just to wash your hair. Also, with regards to modification, several shower-heads now at least have basic shifts in water pressure so you can change the way the water comes out; pulse, massaging, etc. Your shower has the capability to change the flow of water! How awesome is that?!\n\nOh, and while we\u2019re at it let\u2019s talk about something that a lot of people like to do in the shower\u2026singing! Singing in the shower is one of those things that few of us will admit to but a lot of us enjoy doing it. I have several songs that I will limit to just for the shower, sort of like my own personal playlist. Also, with the advent of technology, nowadays you can bring the music into the shower with you with personal shower radios and Bluetooth speakers.\n\nYour shower is also your own personal space, as nobody\u2019s is quite the same. Whether you have multiple shelves, a shower caddy that you bring with you, or things hanging from the ceiling, no design is the same. Also, there is no real pattern of items in the shower, as some people use a single bar of soap to wash their entire body, while others have a sixteen-step process. Once again, there is no right or wrong way to do it, there is just YOUR way.\n\nIt is so easy to take for granted something as simple as showering, since it is usually a (fairly) regular occurrence in your life, but no matter how much time you have, take your time to enjoy it. It\u2019s one of the good parts of your day, no matter what happens. It\u2019s something you can count on, and in today\u2019s environment, that\u2019s important, and an easy way to be happier each day."

I tend to think that it begins with a choice. You must choose to be happy, no matter what your life may look like now. Do not wait to see your world change in order to choose happiness!!! Make the decision that no matter what you see \"out there\", no matter what others tell you, or how life seems to derail you,  that you shall be happy NOW. Just by making that step unfolds, unwinds and tears down blockages that have held you back. Does this mean that the moment that you make this choice all will be butterflies and fairies? Perhaps no. It does mean though that you have opened a space in your life to receive happiness where there was once a wall. "

Isaacson tells us this, not least\u00a0because it provides the\u00a0intellectual \u2013 or maybe better spiritual \u2013 background\u00a0for the minimalist aesthetics of what was to be\u00a0Jobs\u2019\u00a0global\u00a0brand.\n\nThat spiritualism though was messy, often troubled and occasionally troubling compared to the clinical and secular mindfulness approaches we are more used to these days.\n\nAnd yet\u2026\u00a0the teachings of the babas and zen masters, the Tibetan monks and Indian yogis of the seventies are\u00a0the ancestry of\u00a0today\u2019s mindfulness practices. I was interested in what had been cleared out over the decades in order to get to 21st century Western approach to meditation, so I went back to Jobs\u2019 reading list.\n\nBaba Ram Dass was originally a psychology professor called Richard Alpert. Coming, in his own words, from a \u201cJewish, anxiety-ridden, high-achieving tradition,\u201d he suffered stomach problems every time he had to lecture, despite having been through five years of psychoanalysis, and he lectured five days a week. That was before he experimented with LSD, went to India, found a guru, got his new name and returned to the USA to teach the spiritual wisdom of the Buddha, the Tao, Hinduism and Jesus.\n\nCh\u00f6gyam Trungpa, on the other hand, was born into a lineage of important Tibetan spiritual teachers, destined to be a monk and abbott\u00a0but\u00a0later decided to be a lay teacher. He fled Tibet\u00a0when the Chinese took over, and moved first to India, then England, Scotland and the United States. In England and Scotland he fell out with another Tibetan monk, and according to one source, groped a Buddhist nun, claiming that \u201che had women since the age of thirteen.\u201d He was an alcoholic who was left partly paralysed in a car accident after\u00a0passing out drunk at the steering wheel. The meditation centre he was running attracted the attention of the police for drug use. In a famous controversy, he presided over a party where he decided that everyone should strip naked. When a visiting couple made it clear that they didn\u2019t want to participate in these revelries and retreated to their room, he encouraged others to knock down their door, drag them to the party and strip them forcibly.\n\nClearly, meditation teachers were different then from the mindfulness teachers we are used to\u00a0these days.\u00a0Today\u2019s purveyors of meditation\u00a0practices are\u00a0more likely to come from\u00a0the mental health establishment than suffer mental chaos. They could probably set up a randomised, controlled double-blind study to demonstrate the benefits of mindfulness sooner than they could organise a naked drinks party. And they\u2019d be more likely to create an app or some websites with guided meditation sessions than travel around the world seeking the status of a revered baba, guru, tulku or rinpoche.\n\nBut among all the chaos, Trungpa said\u00a0and wrote some brilliant things\u00a0about meditation and spirituality.\u00a0Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism\u00a0is a fabulously written\u00a0warning against phoney spirituality and overly self-satisfied meditation\u00a0efforts:\n\n\u201cSelf-deception is a constant problem as we progress along a spiritual path. Ego is always trying to achieve spirituality.\u201d\n\nAnd there is a useful concept in something he says in that same book that was on Steve Jobs\u2019 reading list. Trungpa says:\n\n\u201cGenerally we prepare too much. We say, \u2018Once I make a lot of money, then I will go somewhere to study and meditate and become a priest,\u2019 or whatever it is we would like to become. But we never do it on the spot. We always plan too much. (\u2026) We want to change our lives, rather than use our lives\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd this is a great distinction: Change our lives, use our lives. Literally, all of the self-help literature tells you it can change your life. Titles like \u201cChange your Life in 7 Days,\u201d \u201cChange Your Life in 15 Minutes,\u201d \u201cChange Your Diet, Change Your Life,\u201d \u201cChange Your Language, Change Your Life\u201d\u00a0abound. But, of course, these books don\u2019t actually change your life. The focus of \u201cchange your life\u201d tends to be on wanting to be richer, healthier, more beautiful, happier, have more friends, more love and so on. It tends to be on outward things, material things. It tends to be on what we have. Self-help literature tries to sell simple routes and shortcuts to getting more.\n\n\u201cI want to change my life\u201d focusses on what more I could have, \u201cI want to use my life\u201d on what more I could do or be.\n\n\u201cChange my life\u201d focusses the mind on a future state when I can be happy. \u201cUse it\u201d focusses it on what I can do right now.\n\n\u201cChange my life\u201d focusses the mind on what life, the universe or others could do for me. \u201cUse it\u201d focusses on what I could do for myself, the universe or even others.\n\n\u201cChange my life\u201d focusses on what we lack and are missing out on. \u201cUse it\u201d focusses on the opportunities and innate talents we\u2019ve been given by virtue of having a human life.\n\nThis question \u201chow can I use my life right now\u201d might distract from \u201chow do I want my life to be different\u201d for long enough to actually generate some insight into what we could do that would really change lives \u2013 ours or those of others. And so using our lives, paradoxically, might just do more to actually bring change.\n\n"

In truth, don't we all seek those attributes but struggle to achieve? People can't wait to retire so they can enjoy some fun, greater happiness and a better way of life yet we should be aspiring to live our lives that way on a day-to-day basis. I can even say that if you can ideally strive to consciously live your life in a healthier way, which includes being mindful of your thoughts, you actually will enjoy a better and healthier lifestyle and a better night sleep.\n\nI would like to speak to how you can sleep better on a regular basis and still lead an active and successful lifestyle. I believe that most of us would like to end our day by relaxing our energy yet we place very little importance on how we can accomplish that feat.\n\nHere are some suggestions that I can make to you that have helped me calm my energy daily, release unwarranted nervous activity of my mind and body and allowed me to live without pills and medication.\n\n\n1. I attempt to surround myself with positive thinking people and environments as much as possible.\n\n\n2. Spend less time texting, reading e-mails and gossiping. While we may need to utilize those tools on a regular basis, we also need to discipline our use so that it does not overpower our lives; instead it will save our lives.\n\n\n3. I center my mind often during the day to keep my focus on what is important to make my life work and to also enable me to work smarter.\n\n\n4. I frequently say mantras to calm my energy and remove over activity of my mind that, too often, is trying to lead me towards negative emotions, such as, fear, worry, guilt and resentment. I even go so far as give my ego mind instructions so that it does not control me but rather, gives me the control. An example might be: Ego Mind, go count all my blessings in my life. That simple statement allows me to focus on where I need to place my energy-on positive thoughts, ideas and creative tools.\n\n\n5. Seek contentment, inner calmness and a belief that it is achievable daily. When you live your life on purpose and have a real reason for living, you tend to be happier and more satisfied with who you are and what you are doing.\n\n\n6. Establish a real sense of self-confidence. When you do, you are better prepared to set reasonable boundaries for your life which include identifying with your core values and what you treasure.\n\n\nI work at clearing my mind nightly from all those items that cause me stress, anxiety and/or frustration. My evenings are the time of day when I need to relax and calm my energy field so that I can ultimately sleep peacefully. I work at it and I suggest if you want to enjoy a pleasant night sleep, you too, will need to work at it.\n\nIn summary, believe that it is important to quiet your mind, calm your energy and body and aim to release all worry, fear and activity of your daily life that will compromise an improved sense of inner peace and relaxation. That is how you too will be better prepared to live a happier life and sleep better too!"

Sadness is stinky, as far as I\u2019m concerned. It stinks upto a very far away distance. It\u2019s just a situation of not being happy, I would rather put it like a situation of not being able to see the happiness. To be Sad reasons are many and certainly not neglectable. Failure is not the end of all if it. Failure is like getting wet in heavy rain. We eventually get dry, iff We give it sufficient time. The same is with life situations, all it needs is time. Human emotions are time driven. The emotions definitely don\u2019t remain the same. Some say it\u2019s all bullshit. Those are the kind of people who don\u2019t wanna get over it, the weak ones. Beat the situation with time and see it healing safely. There is no point in rushing through any of the things of life. We never do anything bad to ourselves, it just happens. So let the betterment part also happen on its own. Not necessarily you can help yourself in every situation. Specially the youth. Youth is to be energetic, charming and youthful as it says. Try and find a happy side in every bad situation, that way your youth never ends\u00a0\ufffc. Sad are those who lose hopes, youths try, harder and eventually succeed. Wear a positive specs to see through the world and see it blossom all around you, the world. There is always an option to react, to enact, to respond, to everything. All in all there is always an option over choices. We, are no more or less than what we choose to reveal at the end of the day. Choose to be happily positive. Make a choice of smile over tears. The world is a big place. We have found as small as protons around us.. Won\u2019t we find simple happiness ? Definitely we should, and we will! Let there be every reason to smile and not a single one for tears. Make this world a better place for yourself and for your people\u00a0\ufffc\ufffc.\u00a0"

You see, I'm about to leave to head home for a while before my next assignment. I pretty much mentally checked out. It was hard for me to find any motivation to do much of anything. The only reason I even woke up in the morning was because I didn't want another lecture about, \"being a good soldier\". About a week ago, I went wild and got in trouble. Now I have to stay here for longer than I should. All I wanted to do was lock myself in my room, cry and sleep. My appetite is gone, I don't enjoy doing the things I usually do, and it takes some serious arm bending just for my friends to get me out of my room. (But wait, this is posted in optimistic, did he post in the wrong subreddit?) I know, hold on, I'm getting to that. \nActually, I was hoping you guys could help me with that. I've been trying to find ways to smile. I listen to music, sometimes that helps. I talk to girls, which is a nice confidence booster, but things always come around to recent events. If anyone has any ways of coping that they could share, they would be much appreciated. I consider myself fairly resilient, but one can only take so much. (also, this is my first post, so if this IS in the wrong subreddit, please let me know.) \n\nThanks in advance, \nJ"

And perhaps in vulnerable moments like those, it doesn't really hurt to indulge in that believe, and then revisit that belief when you're less agonized by regret.\n\nBut what about the intellectually honest / emotional champs who try to stick to objectivity even in those moments? Are they being too hard on themselves? \n\nIs sticking to rationality in those times counterproductive to pragmatic achievement of goals? Probably. But who is to say whether one should choose rationality or pragmatism in any given situation?\n\nHow do you handle or have come to philosophize about those situations of loss?\n\nI suppose the only reason I'm even asking this is because it's getting to me emotionally. If it didn't, it would just be a rather objective answer... but I can't quite tell what that would be while I'm in the heat of it.\n\nCan we increase the supply and fungibility of such things (housing, jobs, traits of potential significant others via a fantastic search and categorization algorithm that would match people up (far more powerful than what dating sites offer)... which can also match up job opportunities, housing opportunities, and everything else that fits the 4 points?\n\nPerhaps a good starting point is: what's a/the rational, philosophical answer to this kind of life problem?\n\nPerhaps what this is is actually just a small slice of the bigger question of happiness, its nature, and how to achieve it."

I believe physical activity significantly improves quality of life and I would be interested to see if those of you who are active in maintaining your happiness (or trying to) regularly perform physical activity. My questionnaire only takes approx 2-3 minutes and it would be amazing if any of you decided to do it. Thank you!\n\nhttps://goldpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5paUBt2Ct81u9Wl"

I was watching the news today and yet another story about an altercation on an airplane between passengers passed my screen. I feel like at minimum once a week I see a story like this on the news or in my social media. The frequency at which I see this to me is an echo of a much louder problem facing society as a whole. \n\nLet's analyze a typical full time worker's life. They spend many years going through HS, going through college to hopefully obtain a piece of paper that will help them get a well-paying job. You would think that it would be easy for them to obtain a job rather quickly, but no. They submit their resume to company after company and are rejected for not having one thing or another. They might finally get a job, and think the hard part is over, but no. They end up working for a company that demands everything of them and then some when the company/boss could really give a crap about the employee, no matter how long one works there. Seniority should be revered and loyalty should be rewarded, not cut loose because it increases a company's bottom line.  And let's not even get into the financial enslavement of student loans and any other financial obligations one may be facing. \n\n\nSo why am I going on this rant? To show you some common themes in an average person's life. People are tired. People are scared. People are stressed. People are undervalued. People have little self-esteem becuase the world tells them not to have any. This cocktail of emotions creates sadness and anger in a person. Inside we process it and can keep a cool exterior, but throw in a greedy coroporation or few making travel so unpleasant and claustrophobic all for making a few extra dollars and it pushes people over the edge. It creates those smartphone videos that go viral and just feeds the cycle of discontent.\n\n\nMy point is.....people are going through so much more than you think. We are constantly bombarded by messages of negativity and people being rude to each other that a true act of kindness is seen as abnormal. Whomever reads this, I urge you to be a light of kindness to people in this dark, sad world of ours . In some way, big or small, you will change the world for the better. Congratuations, you made it to the end!\n\n\n\n\n"

That homeles\u2019  happiness (a plate of food), is absolutely nothing within the eyes of a millionaire who has the opportunity to eat whatever whenever. Consequently, happiness is subjective and what we have to do, is seek toward our needs and their satisfaction.\nAppart from our needs, which is one of the main factors that lead to our happiness, it\u2019s very important to focus in the present. When we do remain stuck in the past, can cause depression and trying to control future can cause stress and anxiety. Our thoughts and energy must be consumed on how to maintain our spirit to present and to live every minute to the fullest. Our bodies and mind deserve to enjoy every single meal we eat, every single word we learn or every talk we have with our beloved. \nTo sum up, happiness is a need itself and we have to feed it to grow by working on our selves. Kick out all negativity, starting from gossiping. \n\n\nI am 22 years old and I am a psychologist student on the 3rd year.

I have made a lot of people in my life laugh out loud because of how devoted I was to seeing the world as a beautiful, positive place. Subsequently, I made them roll around on the floor when I told them that they are beautiful and that they have something to give back to the world. And the same folks are dumbfounded, and never believe me, when I finally tell them that I think I am truly beautiful and that I am worth somebody's time. Because \"How could this pansy make a difference in MY life?\"\n\nBut this is no laughing matter. I am on a quest of self discovery and a search through my mind and body for personal integrity. It's a life that many choose never to face because they are too afraid of what they might find. I have found beauty in the greatest disasters in history, and I have shed tears of amazement at the sight of a mere ant pushing its way up a tiny pile of dirt. Just because some people see the world as a cold, dark, and hideous place where we all harm one another doesn't mean that it's all like that. And just because some folks think that their lives are meaningless doesn't mean that I treat mine with that same sort of indifference and disrespect. I also understand that not everything is inherently good in the world either.\n\nBut what I'll never do again is focus my attention on those bad parts. Because I don't have time for that!! I am too busy healing to notice when somebody hurts me. I am too busy laughing when somebody else is fearful. And I am too tired of trying to convince dubious people my age that we are all in this together and that we all are significant, and that the world is a wide, bright, and extraordinary place to be alive right now.\n\nI am not a joke. I am not retarded. I am not crazy. I am the happiest person I know. I am an overwhelmingly positive spirit that cannot be broken or hurt. To get to know a person like me better, all you need to do is open yourself up to me and to the idea of being happy. I could say so much more and talk about it forever. But I've already said everything that needs to be said for anybody to understand who I truly am at a base level.\n\nThat's all.\""

Today, he picked up a 30cm knife whilst screaming at me. Sure, he just \"waved it around\" rather than pointing/ stabbing it in my direction... But that's still a fucking psycho thing to do. He will continue to rave and rant (swearing and throwing insults) for endless minutes.\n\n\n\n\n>He calls his staff terrible names (*dumb ass, sarcastic bitch, moron, f-cking dick head, soft-cock, dick brains, etc*), he touches our asses (females), and he says \"Got a problem with it, then get out of here!\"\n\n\n\n\n>To top it off, I am getting paid just 4c above the absolute minimum wage. I'm being taxed quite a bit, so working in absolute *hell* with the *devil* is earning me just over $12.50 p/h (after tax).\n\n\n\n\n\n>To make matters even worse, we don't get given a roster. There isn't a roster. The boss just says \"Go home now\" when he doesn't want you any more and then \"You start tomorrow at...\" if you're working the next day. This means I am never guaranteed hours and I can't make plans because I never know when Ill be working.\nI have bills to pay. \n\n\n\n\n>My social life is crumbling because I can never make plans, and even when I do, if it gets any later than 9pm, I start getting sickeningly anxious... Because I know I'll be tired in the morning when I have to wake up at 6am to go work with the devil.\n\n\n\n\n\n>It's a slow time of year, but I'm trying to get a new job.\nMy boyfriend tells me every day \"Quit\". I should. But the thought of being \"unemployed\" makes my stomach twist.\n\n\n\n\n\n>I used to be so proud of my work ethics and abilities, but now, he has personally attacked me and worn my confidence down so thin that I feel like I don't deserve anything better. So I go back, day after day, to this hell hole.\"\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Today**, I finally had the courage to politely tell my boss that I wouldn't be coming back after the weekend. He took it well (he was in a good mood, oddly...), but it still had me shaking with nervousness. \n\n\n\nLess than an hour later, I got a call from a place that I applied to in early *december*. They loved me in my interview (I had it yesterday arvo after work!), and want me to start next week!\n\n\n\n\nI'll be going from my $15.61 p/h (before tax) (*For the non-Australians; $15 is actually a very low pay rate for an adult here. I actually looked up the legal minimum to see if it was even legal to pay me this low!) to $22 p/h, and instead of irregular and short hours, I'll be working 9-5, 5 days a week.

However, they are unfortunately one of life\u2019s necessities. When I was in University, I used to leave dishes in the sink until my roommates began to claim that I had to be running some kind of gross science experiment. Laundry, however, can be one of those around-the-house tasks that you can at least can tolerate, if not actually enjoy.\n\nFor a large portion of my youth, my mother was the primary earner in the house, working a full-time Mon-Fri job, while my father was the secondary, working as a substitute teacher during the school year. What this meant was that my dad handled a lot of the day-to-day housework and took care of the kids for the majority of the day. He used to call himself \u2018Mr. Mom\u2019 a lot of the time, and still brags about it, even now. Short answer here is that I did not grow up seeing just one parent do most of the chores, it was well-broken down. Also, because my dad never stopped talking about his contributions, it meant that I never had any notions about a mystical \u2018laundry-fairy\u2019. I knew exactly where it came from and of course he had sure that as soon as I could walk that I knew how to do it.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about laundry then, the ultimate in transforming chaos into order. You take a massive pile of wrinkled and dirty clothes, place them in a magical device called a washing machine, they come out clean on the other end, and then they are folded and put away. I have learned by being around several people in my life, that everyone has their own unique style when it comes to doing the laundry. My aunt used to still hang clothes on the line outside to dry eventhough she had a dryer, saying she liked the fresh scent that only airing them outside could give.\n\nLaundry is also one of the few chores that actually has a name associated with it in some people\u2019s houses or buildings. It\u2019s not the basement; it\u2019s the laundry room\u2026shudders. It\u2019s borderline psychological warfare as far as I\u2019m concerned. I am willing to wager that people would spend a lot less time in the living room if it was called the vacuum space.\n\nThe other thing I found about laundry when I was younger is how much fun a newly dried pile of clothes on a bed can be. It\u2019s like a warm pile of leaves to a kid, and can easily be constructed into a fort (to your parents\u2019 dismay sometimes when they\u2019ve asked you to sort it and come back finding you trying to rescue the pillows from the evil sock empire). When I used to play hide and seek with my friends, if I was lucky there would be a fresh pile of laundry still waiting to be sorted on my parents\u2019 bed, and if there was\u2026well then I had the ultimate hiding spot. I will certainly admit to still jumping in the laundry pile on my bed now, to feel like a kid all over again, even if just for a moment.\n\nLaundry, luckily, is one of the easier of the daily chores. It\u2019s a matter of loading the machine, maybe scrubbing a spot or two with cleaner, and then closing the lid and waiting for it to do whatever it needs to do to make your clothes, sheets, and towels clean again. For those who don\u2019t have their own machines, or live in an apartment (or college residence), then maybe you have a moment in the communal laundromat where you can sit cross-legged on your machine and read the latest book (or watch Netflix on your phone, no judgment here). You\u2019re almost forced to take time for yourself, and that can sometimes be a beautiful thing\u2026and much needed.\n\nThen of course there\u2019s the folding (if you don\u2019t fold, no worries there, but give it a try sometime), of taking a pile of disorder and turning it into something neat, clean and organized. There\u2019s no correct way of doing it either as I have discovered through many years that people have all been taught different ways of folding. Some roll, some cross-fold, some iron, and some flatten. Despite what your significant other may say, there\u2019s no wrong way. Defend your battle strategy in the war on chaos!\n\nSo the next time you travel to the basement\u2026or the laundromat, and toss that way-too-heavy dirty pile of clothes into the machine, take a moment for yourself and realize what you\u2019re doing. You may not shower today, but at least your clothes will be clean for when you get around to putting them on. In the saga of daily life, it\u2019s one thing that you at least have near-complete control over. You folded your shirts that way\u2026or didn\u2019t fold, either way, you won another battle, so be proud of your accomplishment. Now go outside and get them dirty again! Each spot is a badge of honour and memory in the fields of life."

Man, I was wrong. \n\nCut to recently, last summer, when I was in France on tour with the Brass and Reed band I'm in and the concert band conducted by our conductor's brother. I got talking to one girl in my band who I had never talked to(I was new in band) because she struck up a conversation while we were walking. She was really cool and because she started the conversation(not very good evidence, I know) and other things I interpreted as hints, I got this weird feeling she liked me. I developed a good crush on her I messed with this thought but then threw it away because I thought, nah, I'm just dreaming again. I won't be able to properly go out with anybody until college.\n\nI was wrong!!! We started talking on Instagram before midterm in October all because of one fateful meme she accidentally sent me and we started Snapchatting soon after. Because I didn't know her that well and it was a clean slate I thought I might as well give it a shot to try and go out with her because I was feeling kind of confident, even though I didn't have high hopes. Just last week, she told me out of nowhere that she did actually like me?!?!?? I was pretty fucking ecstatic and quite confused to say the least, and this may be the cringiest post you've ever read but I did it!! I actually made it this far with a girl and I've never been happier with myself.\n\nAnyways, we're gonna go see Ed Sheeran in may and I can't fucking wait.\n\nThanks for being my venting bucket, Reddit."

She splashed rainbow after rainbow across the sky and let them crackle, flicker, cool and eventually fade into silver metal flecks that floated above my head so far out of reach. Teenagers set off cherry bombs in parking lots and kids ran around backyards with sparklers in both hands, illuminating the evening in irregular streaks. Music was playing but from somewhere far enough away that it sounded like a dull heartbeat \u2014 only if you plugged your ears, you could still feel it because it was in you. Burnt orange and baby blue hung suspended in a mist for what seemed like hours even though there was a breeze blowing down the length of the coast. In the valley far below, a glowing galaxy of streetlights cast blurry shadows around the city, through alleyways, around corners and across the sides of buildings. You could touch the shadows and if you did, your hands came away black and sooty. You could walk through shadows hanging in mid-air like sheets on a clothesline and you could feel the tiny grains touch your open eyes before you blinked and they fell to the ground like dust. I imagined I was somewhere in the sky, running my hand down a moonbeam like you would a staircase banister but rather at an upward angle. I followed it across the sky from one star to another, connecting the dots until it led me through the deepest darkness I\u2019d ever known. Finally the morning light turned over on the horizon like an ember in a fireplace before it glows and eventually catches fire. I made it home and you were there waiting for me and it was then that I realized it was you who stirred the fire and guided me through the blackness. I\u2019ve been called a moonlighter before but this may be the first time it all adds up.\n\n\n[His blog](http://www.ayoungblog.com)"

I had given up and hoped that he just found a new home and was safe. Today, 5 MONTHS LATER, i happened to be scrolling through one of the lost/stolen pages out of boredom and i saw a \"found dog\" post from the town over from where i lived.

There are days I still feel like I\u2019m a scared little kid. \n\nBut today something clicked, it sounds silly but Coldplay\u2019s song \u2018paradise\u2019 came on the radio and I actually listened to the lyrics and thought, holy crap that was me. When I was scared as a kid I would curl up in my bed and dream of living some where close to a tropical beach with a hot dude that I loved.... far away from all the stuff I had to deal with then. Then it hit me, I do. I made that happen. I live in Hawaii, I\u2019m married to a man I truly love, we have a beautiful son, and I am doing well in my career. I am happy. I am allowed to be happy. "

Just a week ago, I posted about this venting on /r/offmychest because I thought nothing would be able to happen with this guy for the foreseeable future while I was working at the same job. I wanted to ask him out so badly but didn't think he was allowed. Long story short, I've had a big crush on my co-worker for close to two months. Every day we see each other, we flirt hardcore and find every excuse to talk and he makes me really look forward to coming in (and vice versa, from what he's said). \n\nWell, yesterday, I went in to work on my day off to check my schedule. I saw him and immediately we began our typical smiley flirtatious thing, but then another coworker jumped into the conversation to start complaining about his schedule. I went home and a couple hours later, I got a random Facebook message from him saying, \"hey, I wanted to ask you this when you came to work but (coworker) was in the way - would you ever want to hang out with me sometime?\"\n\nI was speechless, having wanted to ask him the same thing for weeks. Immediately I said yes. He was like \"oh well I was actually thinking about asking if you wanted to do something tonight, but it's kind of short notice\". I said, \"well I'm not doing anything else\". So we exchanged numbers and then decided to meet at a local pizza place, followed by a couple drinks at the bar upstairs.\n\nWe were having a great time and I was pretty drunk, so wanted to sober up before driving home (and I didn't want the night to end yet). So I asked if he wanted to walk around my school's campus (across the street from the bar). He said sure, and we walked around a bit, then walked through the arboretum. It was dark and empty, and pretty romantic, and we were just talking and joking around, followed by progressively heavy flirting. We sat down on a bench and then finally he was straight up like, \"So, I find you super attractive, and I've really wanted to hang out with you for awhile\". I told him the feeling was mutual and then we kissed a lot. Finally we got up again and he held my hand and we walked and talked some more, and made out at various spots on campus haha. He kept telling me how great of a time he was having, and was like, \"I'm trying not to be overeager here, but I'd really like to see you again\". \n\nAround 2:30 am we finally went our respective ways and I couldn't stop smiling on the drive home. I felt on top of the world. This morning when I woke up, I checked my phone and he texted me saying, \"Hey you, just wanted to say I had a great time last night\".\n\nI feel awesome!\n\n(Oh, update - we're going out again on Thursday. :))"

Now when I say I was into this girl, I mean like, I was falling for this girl.\n\nShe had been a good friend for a while and we are part of the same friend group, so she quickly grew on me, and I began to like her extremely.\n\nSo fast forward, she rejects me, I'm depressed for 3 days, i get over it. (not fully, but eh)\n\nToday I found out that my best friend likes here, and so the thought of my best friend and the girl I am head over heals for getting together kinda hurt, but I had to ask him, to confirm.\n\nSo I asked, and he said that yeah, he does like her and is planning on asking her out.\n\nAlright, she already told me she doesn't like me, it hurts, but w/e.\n\nThen we shared this moment, and mind you, we have literally never had an emotional talk together.\n\n\"Me:\nNow I feel like an asshole\n\n :/\n\nHim:\n Why?\n\nMe:\nCause you were planning on asking her\n\n and I literally asked you to let me ask her\n \nHim:\nNah dude\n\n I'd give my life for you\n\n No second thoughts\"\n\nAnd... that made me happy. The sadness and hurt I had disappeared, and I was just left with this happy feeling, knowing that I had a real friend, a real bro, who would give up anything for me, and that I feel the same.\n\n\n\nBTW: I was gonna post this on r/happy, but I didn't want to risk him seeing it, as I don't know if he uses that sub."

I live in a 3 story house, have a football field in my backyard and a tennis court, a lovely golden retriever running around all day, a lovely girlfriend, lots of friends, in few days I'm getting my driving license and I'll be driving a Bmw as my first car...basically if i point my finger at something, I can have it. BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER, because I feel empty all the time, I'm not in the mood for anything, I just feel like laying in the sun and thinking about what's wrong with me. Today I skipped classes and stood in the sun for three hours straight thinking about these feelings. In two months time I have to take the national baccalaureate exam(the most important exam in my country) and I can't pull myself together to learn and prep for the exam. I'm not even in the mood to play a silly game or play with my dog. Does anybody feel like this? I have different periods, sometimes I'm productive as hell, wake up early etc. and sometimes I'm just as useful as a potato. I hate it\n\nThanks for listening"

I have wanderlust and I dream of traveling indefinitely, and my significant other feared change and longed for stability and familiarity. I have been saving up for an RTW trip for 2 years now, and when my SO realized they could not save up enough to go, we broke up.\n\nI'm 25 years old and had to begrudgingly move back home suddenly. Currently sleeping on the couch. Working a dead-end retail job with a college degree. My mother asked me what my goals are, and I sadly said I would probably move to Austin and go to grad school with the money I saved.\n\nShe seemed displeased with this answer. Today my father walks in the room and confronts me.\n\"Your mother tells me you want to move to Austin. Why? How much money do you have saved for your travels?\"\n\n\"I have around 10K saved, but i'll probably need closer to 15k or 20k. I am not the wistful freshly graduated 23 year old...all my friends are getting married and starting careers. I wonder if I should take the money and go to grad school? Seems like the responsible choice.\"\n\nMy father shakes his head. \"I'm giving you a couple grand so you can leave by October. Don't shelve your dreams. If you move now, you will never go. When you get back, you will be a better candidate for grad school and you can worry about your future then.\" They are very poor, by the way. I make only slightly less than them.\n\nReddit, I am writing this with tears of joy. My parents are so loving. They see their child in a state of grey and they are forcing me to live my dream instead of settling for what society expects of me. I love them so much."

            "value": "Unhappiness never attacks anyone, instead people invite it by their actions.Its ok that if a person does not have much fun or social life. But , its Still  possible to stay happy without fun. Friends, hobbies and activities can do wonders. Are we doing some mistakes? Sometimes people just lack enthusiasm. Is their emotional conditioning a reason for that? Or, are life circumstances beyond their control?  Is it depression, and other psychological diseases, or a clinical illness , there are also unknown factors that contribute to feeling down that you can influence. Here are Top 5 reasons you may be unhappy, and suggestions on how to learn new unknown things about yourself to bring that smile back.\n\n\n    You care too much about what others think.\n\nMost unhappy people are thinking too much about others.\n\nSay if a girl is very caring but an introvert, she is mostly concerned about her actions in a get together or a party. She panic in the name of an outing. Why? As she has unknowingly created a hypothetical situation, where she might feel an unknown embarrassment. She hasn\u2019t left her room , but will think so much about others, that she gets tormented inside . Nobody knows about it. Nobody give a damn also.\n\nInstead, every person likes a caring person. If you won\u2019t go out, how will people know that beautiful part of you?\n\nWhether its Sex or first date, every person has gone through it. It seems so stupid and foolish very person in this world wonders, that he or she was so wrong in thinking so many stupid things about it.\n\nSo don\u2019t think much. Don\u2019t worry much. Just go for it.\n\nIf you are a thinker and prober type , then allow yourself to think after that outing.\n\nImprovise after the action , not worry much about first jump in the swimming pool.\n\nMoral of the story:- You can\u2019t please everyone, instead please and pamper yourself.\n\nparent's heath\n\n    You Blame others a bit more.\n\nI see so many young people living in their past.\n\nA friend of mine is 50 yrs old. He is doing well enough and raising his family in a nice way. He still does not miss any opportunity to blame his father. His father was quite a strict person. Lot of communication gap. He could choose his career due to father\u2019s expectations. So he still believes, he could have done better, if father understood well.\n\nFine..Agreed.\n\nFather is no more alive. Cribbing won\u2019t affect anybody at all expect my friend. I tell him someday \u201cNow you are grown up. It was ok that your father didn\u2019t give you freedom. But the day, you turned 24, you also started earning. Why didn\u2019t you supported yourself well to start your stream of studies all over again. It was very much possible. You could have shaped your destiny. I know you for so many years. Just due to this blaming game, Now, you\u2019re a pessimistic person, you taken notice all of the bad in your life\u201d\n\nSee, most of the person does not realized that nobody can change his past. But we have good enough opportunity to start all over again.\n\nPeople who think of themselves as victim, can never happy. They don\u2019t have any control over their past. They believe that their unhappiness has been caused by an person and it can only be taken away by that person. Its live a mirage. A self inflicted would which can never been healed.They live in the miserable land of \u2018if only.\u2019\u201d\n\nBiggest problem of such thinking is that a person forget about his own powers to change the things. Mostly such person avoid to take responsibilities for their own action. They start living in the wold where they have an easy target for every failure. They never give 100% in any task.\n\nMoral of the Story:- Start taking responsibility of your own actions. Any glory or failure is yours.\n\n\n    You compare yourself to everyone.\n\n\u201cYour success is measure by others, but your satisfaction is measured by you only\u201d\n\nOur society reminds us again and again about the social status. Most people end up playing this comparison game.\n\nAll TV advertisement are driven on this formula. Imagine so many people left the comfort of their cozy beds and slept whole night at a smartphone store to become the first proud owner. What happens next? The person put his selfie on a social network site. How many people love that sight? Almost everyone congratulate him but never show their zealousy. In another one week, the excitement is over.\n\n\nPeople buy clothes, cars, gadgets and so many things to show others. They try hard to make smile every time. All celebrity does that. It may give you a feeling of superiority. Is it happiness ? Just because you\u2019re comfortable in your life and job, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re necessarily happy. You may discover that even though you have a cushy life, you are dealing with depression. If so, find what makes you happy, and pursue it even at the cost of your comfort.\n\nI see so many young people in society, where once they see little cash crunch or adversity, they get into depression. You won\u2019t find them on any social networking sites. They were always comparing them with others. They feel so bad at not being able to buy more gadgets.\n\nTo see the other side, many people who could not afford such lavish gadgets , vehicles etc. They feel inferior. Why? Same comparison cycle.\n\nThat\u2019s why when people start earning bit more, their first spend is on a gadget. This is what advertisement are for.. They are targeted for such newly so called rich guys.\n\nProblem starts when you scrutinize only one small area of that person\u2019s life and see where you match up. For example, I compare myself to Brad Pitt and determine he\u2019s a handsome than me. Is it gonna make me unhappy? Of course. However, this is only one small area of life. Who knows? Maybe I can paint or sing better than him? Looking at a specific area in a whole person and ranking that part against yourself is a pointless activity.\n\nDon\u2019t use microscope and see just one part of the life. This is also a habit, which will keep on giving you problem in life. This habit is the reason of unhappiness in your life.\n\nInstead compare with your own self. Are you working harder than previous year? Are you putting more efforts? Are you learning from your mistakes and don\u2019t repeat them?\n\nMoral of the story:- Happiness is Possible if you see the larger picture.\n\n\n    Nice people really finish last.\n\n\u201cI am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them have never happened.\u201d \u2013 Mark Twain\n\nMajority of people who are unhappy in life are not the ones, who are poor or in some trauma. They are bunch of nice guys. Be a guy or a gal, If you keep on staying nice, You are paving way to unhappiness. Everybody likes nice people, but nice people are just nice. They spend so much time in making everyone happy.\n\nIt is impossible to make everyone happy. People seek out nice guys, when they need a shoulder to cry. When they want to share their problems, they look out for nice people. But, whenever there is a part or get together, nobody remember them.\n\nNice people worry a lot. Worry creates lots of inner turmoil. It is like a see saw game, which will end up giving nothing. They spend less time on making themselves happy. If they focus their energies to bring enthusiasm in their own life, they can do wonders. Anyone, who can advice others a lot, if they do it for themselves, it can really make a great difference for themselves.\n\nSome people focus so much on the stars that they miss the entire journey\u2019s sights, experiences, and lessons learned in getting there. Find as much joy in the adventure as in obtaining the end goal. If you don\u2019t, you will be frustrated until your future vision is reality. Since this may or may not happen, why limit yourself when you can find just as much happiness in the quest as in the destination?\n\nMoral of the story:- Be nice with yourself first.\n\n\n    You didn\u2019t spend time in making real friends.\n\n\u201cA friend in need is a friend in deed\u201d.\n\nIf on a holiday, you find yourself lonely and depressed, then its fine but it\u2019s a sign that you have not nurtured enough relationships yet. Being lonely is the biggest poverty in life. It is rare that a person gets a good friend on its own.\n\nMaking a good friend is like venturing into stock market. You don\u2019t know , which stock will give returns. But until we don\u2019t buy few, we cant get real picture out of them. Few will go up and give you handsome profit. Most of them will be loss making. But over a period of time, you get wise and get selective.\n\nSame is the case of friends and relations. You have to spend time in connecting with people. May be it\u2019s a club or an event or a society or a cause or a social networking site\u2026keep on digging. If you try hard, you will surely find good gems, But don\u2019t lend money to friends as most people don\u2019t return money. Over a period of time, you can lend money to trusted few.\n\nOut of hundred acquaintances and contacts, you will find a one who will stand by your side.\n\nWe need some strong relations in life as we are human. Its extremely important to spend quality time in nurturing relations. Many friends may ditch you, but as I said. Keep on digging. Finding friendships will certainly improve your enthusiasm for what each day brings.\n\nUse Facebook or other sites and spend good time making a great profile. Seek out social settings with people who share similar interests and beliefs to build a common foundation and launch a great relationship.\n\nMoral of the story:-  No pain , No gain ."

            "value": "Boxes- Imagination, Hope & Surprise\u2026cubed\n\nIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve probably had your fill of boxes now with the holiday season ending, whether it was unpacking the decorations\u2026or tripping on one in a mall on Boxing Day.  However, I was reminded of one thing, watching my family open presents on Christmas morning, that just how magical a box can be. The look on someone\u2019s face as they\u2019re holding it and the child-like excitement that goes on when they open it.\n\nOne of the great things about boxes is the surprising amount of hope that they are associated with. Think back to the last box that you opened, whether it was a shoe box, chocolates, cereal, it doesn\u2019t really matter. What matters is that there may have been a small part of you that wondered if there might be something different in that box? That the universe had something special for you? Why do you think we open presents on the holidays? We\u2019ve associated hope and cheer with the box already, and we don\u2019t even know it.\n\nI know, I know, all your logic says NO, but there\u2019s still a part of you there that knows exactly what I mean. Your cat will probably know what I\u2019m talking about too. Our family cat is 12 years old and she still managed to knock down and stumble into one of the discarded boxes at Christmas.\n\nI will be the first to admit that the last time I went to the shoe store and they brought me a box to try some pairs on, there was at least 2% of me that thought, \u201cWell a million other times it would be shoes, but for me, it\u2019s got to be a dragon egg this time.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a dragon egg, but I still got a good pair of shoes, so it turned into a win after all. It\u2019s alright to dream, no one should ever shame you for it.\n\nThe dreaming started when we were kids, we would tear through that cereal box looking for that prize inside, trying to beat our siblings to it (because there was always only one), but then the real magic came one day. My parents bought a washing machine and that box was mine. It was a fort for the battle of the laundry room, a pirate ship sailing between couches to rescue my sister stranded on the island of the coffee table. Eventually it would be cut out to resemble the Stanley Cup, and just like that it was now the ultimate prize of backyard road hockey.\n\nMaybe you didn\u2019t have your own box fort but some days you may feel like you wish you could just crawl into your own box (eventhough you probably wouldn\u2019t fit as well as you did about twenty years ago). Well, you learn as a kid that you can\u2019t hide in your box forever (it eventually breaks down or your parents take it to be recycled), but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t take your own box with you, packing all your hopes and dreams with you wherever you go.\n\nSo next time you\u2019re in your office, you\u2019re at the store, you\u2019re at home with your latest online purchase, and you\u2019re holding tightly to that random box, ready to open it, take a moment to dream for a change. Imagine that you\u2019re on a mystical quest delivering those office supplies down the hallway to the Accounting department. You\u2019re stacking boxes in a storeroom or warehouse? I doubt anyone is going to complain if you stack them in the shape of a small castle; you might even brighten someone\u2019s day besides yours.\n\nOthers see recycling to be taken out, but for even just a moment, you can see endless possibilities."

It means you\u2019ve decided to look beyond the imperfections.\u201d \u2013Unknown\n\nOur lives don\u2019t always look exactly like we want it to be. We spend days doing the routine stuff. We drive from home to office, complete the given tasks and drive back home. If you will think about your daily routine you will feel, you are living a very robotic life.\n\nYou might feel that if I have more money, a different office, better home or a luxury car, I would be happier with my routine life. You definitely can seek to change the wrapping paper, but it won\u2019t help unless the gift inside remains the same.\n\nHow you feel about yourself or the way you talk to other people, or just smile looking at stranger only because it feels good- nothings of these things depend on your life situation. Your life may not be going really smoothly right now, but you need to understand that there are always reasons to be happy, given you chose to be happy.\n\nBelow are a few reasons why you should be happy despite all your problems.\n\nLearn to enjoy the present moment and with practice it will become a habit\nIf you always postpone your happiness for tomorrow, probably you will do the same when you achieve what you are seeking. It may sound strange, but the ability to appreciate what is in front of you has nothing to do with what you really have. It is about your attitude of appreciating good things in life at any particular time. Look around and you will definitely find many things that will make you feel blessed and joyous.\n\nLook for reasons to be happy now and it will benefit your future\nAccording to Dr. Dacher Keltner of the University of California she can predict the future of a person only by judging the strength of his smile. In a research where an yearbook was examined, it showed that the females who expressed more positive emotion in those photos enjoyed a greater sense of well-being, had more successful marriages and became more mentally focused.\n\nBy choosing happiness, you can improve your health, something that presents you with many possibilities in life\nMany people take their health for granted, until they fall ill. In a study it was found that optimistic people have a stronger immune system than their negative counterparts. So, choose to be happy now and now can enjoy great health for many years to come.\n\nLearn to notice and appreciate the details for long-term happiness\nOnce you have everything you have ever wished for, you will still have your highs and lows. If you don\u2019t know how to enjoy the little things, your well-being will be affected by your life\u2019s circumstances. Whenever something will go wrong, you will feel very sad and disappointed. Look for things that make you happy- spending time with your loved ones, listening to your favorite band, hiking the mountains. Focus on those things now and let them make you smile. This way you will always have many pleasures in life.\n\nEvery day presents a new opportunity to be better than yesterday; that pursuit can improve your self-esteem and even your happiness\nMany people are unhappy with themselves. As a result, they also have tough time sleeping at night. They feel disappointed and dissatisfied. Instead of being sad about how you or the things around you are, take every day as a opportunity to improve yourself. One step at a time. Set simple attainable goals for you. These small improvements and mini-goals will eventually move yourself toward your larger dreams. And you will take joy in every day.\n\nRemember happiness is not about what you have. Happiness is about how you interpret and appreciate what is in front of you. So, today choose to focus on the good- in yourself as well as the world.\n\n Visit: https://wordpress.com/view/thelovepat.wordpress.com for more\n\n "

Participants must be able to read and write in English.\n\n**What do I have to do?**\nYou will need to log at least one positive event per day for a month, but we would encourage you to log more if you like. You will also log your daily mood and answer psychological surveys within the app.\n\n**What do I get for participating?**\nUpon completion of the study you will be entered into a prize draw to win a \u00a350 Amazon voucher!\n\n**Can I read the participant consent agreement?**\nSure! http://ubicomp-kent.org/projects/SnapAppy/consent.php\n\n**I am interested!**\nClick here to download SnapAppy and get started:\nhttp://ubicomp-kent.org/projects/SnapAppy/"

At one point, I took a training to become a ski instructor in an indoor ski hall (I live in Europe, some 800km from the Alps) with the idea of becoming a ski instructor for a couple seasons in the alps. However, that one particular job fell through (long story), and it never really happened.\n\nBut from time to time I still feel like life is passing me by, and I'm not doing the things I really love. I'm getting older fast, and if I don't change something I'll probably regret it forever. There's a couple things really holding me back from moving to the mountains for at least one winter... the biggest being job security, carreer and money. \n\nIn the winter I'd have to work a shitty job, unless I become a ski instructor, in order to be able to ski in my free time. I can live with that, I think. But once summer comes around, there'd probably be no good jobs to be found. I'd have to find temporary jobs, temporary appartments if I do move back to where I'm from, and I'd probably be broke pretty much forever. If I'm ever done with the mountain life, I'd have a hard time getting back into what most people would consider a regular life.\n\nThe other thing that I'd need to get over is doing things on my own (unless I find someone crazy enough to come with me, but I doubt that). I have a hard time working out on my own, let alone moving abroad for a couple months.\n\nI'd love to hear some tips on how to look at this, tips to change things up. One small change I made in the right direction, I think, is becoming a developer. I hope that in a year, maybe two, I'll have learned enough to become a freelancer and become independant of where and when I work. But that may as well be a pipedream..."

I\u2019ve always kept it hidden, the only people I would tell would be my friends because they go through it too. However...I don\u2019t know what it is, but today I feel like something has changed. I\u2019m tired of living in my room, isolated, sad. I want to be happy. I want others to be happy, but what I\u2019ve learned is that for others to be happy, you can\u2019t be depressed around them. It\u2019ll make them feel down, of course they\u2019ll try to help you, but if you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t want help, then it only brings them down. I don\u2019t want that. It breaks me to know I\u2019ve hurt others because of the way I act, or how I feel. I wish no one had to feel the way I did, and I understand people have it way worse, but that\u2019s just life. The least you can do is get better yourself and help others. So...that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m going to live life the way it should be lived. I\u2019m going to try extremely hard to stay positive and be kind to not only others but myself. I\u2019m going to love myself the way I should have all along. If there\u2019s ever a moment where I think it\u2019s not working, and depression strikes back, I\u2019m going to fight. I\u2019m going to fight until I win. I\u2019m done with my old self. It\u2019s time for a change, and hopefully this change will bring new beginnings to lead me back in the right direction. "

            "value": "Today we are going to talk about something that a lot of you are going to appreciate\u2026Pajamas (otherwise known as PJs, Pajams, Pajamajams, Jammies, Snugglies, Sleepy-clothes- you get the idea). If you\u2019re reading this while wearing your PJs (which is what I will refer to them as for the remainder of this post), then I salute you and your desire to relax and be comfy. You\u2019re awesome, you deserve it, so enjoy it.\n\nPJs are your nightly (sometimes daily) no-hold-barred uniform. It is your unique statement of how you are going to greet the evening. They can be light and flowing or thick and fluffy, depending on what you like and the time of year.\n\nWhen you choose your PJs, you are choosing to be comfortable, more than anything else. If it looks good and is comfortable, that\u2019s even better\u2026.the line between messy and dashing as well as between lazy and sexy mostly vanishes when we are talking about bed clothes. It\u2019s your freedom to be who you are in your own space.\n\nThe other thing about PJs is that there is no set uniform about what is expected for bedtime. It\u2019s one of those free choices that you get to make every day. Yours could consist of a four-layered matching set, plaid flannels, your partner\u2019s t-shirt, or just your birthday suit. Once again there are no rules, although I would advise against wearing nothing when you have company over or you\u2019re visiting friends, but that\u2019s your choice, not mine.\n\nPJs are also associated with relaxation and comfort at a level that cannot really be explained. PJs are permission to relax, to just take it easy and wind down at the end of the day. Usually when you put them on, you are making a mental statement that your day belongs to you now. Who wants to watch a Netflix marathon in Jeans? Yuck! It\u2019s the same reason why you grumble a bit when you initially take them off, you\u2019re acknowledging the end of that relaxation. This is also why when you have a \u2018lazy-day\u2019 or are not feeling well, it is usually referred to as a \u2018bed-day\u2019, meaning you will wear your PJs constantly, because in your way, you are relaxing and\u2026just one step away from sleeping at all times. Your clothes have given you the freedom to just take it easy, and that\u2019s really special.\n\nThere is also a certain kinship between you and your PJs, as you will usually wear them until they are falling apart and barely functioning anymore, because they\u2019re yours (they\u2019ve been with you every night- that equals out to a third of your daily life). Gapped open boxers? Sure! Shorts that fit you ten years ago? Of course! PJ bottoms with both knees torn? They\u2019re yours! Oh, and if you want to make someone upset really fast, tell them that it\u2019s time to throw them out\u2026.Oh, you are treading on holy ground there my friend, so watch your step.\n\nNow, due to the comfort level that PJs are associated with, I\u2019m sure that several of you (particularly my former University Residence cohorts), are used to either seeing or wearing pajamas as normal clothes throughout the day. I was able to figure out, that while in University Residence, people are more comfortable wearing their PJ bottoms as regular clothes because the University is their home. You see 4th period English class? Well I see 50 people in my living room. I have to admit  that it was fun, being able to play a \u2018Where\u2019s Waldo?\u2019 style of game while on campus, as PJ bottoms meant Rez. For those of you that didn\u2019t have the same experience, and just people wearing PJs wherever and whenever, to me it is a beautiful sign of someone who refuses to stop relaxing. Someone said I had to take off my comfy pants? Who?! It makes me happy to see it when I do.\n\nYour life, in some ways, is a series of PJs. Chances are you may have started with little footie-pajamas when you were young, graduating into designs (Ninja Turtles & Fighter Jets for me), before choosing something lighter (just pants or shirt), before ending up back in full-body pajamas in your golden years.\n\nPJs are a full circle cycle, and it\u2019s a beautiful thing, because it\u2019s a full circle of comfort and safety for you. You wear them to guard against the cold of the night, or just to be comfortable while you\u2019re sleeping.  Either way they\u2019re yours, so the next time you put them on, enjoy it. This is one of the good parts of life and it\u2019s always important to focus on those, especially for such a significant portion of your life."

I have started a [gaming YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwn6-MD4tWZQ0loPpYUQBUw/videos) for children and young people where the content can be reliably content appropriate.\n\nI have worked with children and young people for over 8 years, and I have been a gamer for even longer.\n\nWith a lot of gaming content aimed at children and young people I believe that some of the games are not suited for them, e.g. grand theft auto and even five nights at Freddy\u2019s can have a negative impact on younger children who are watching let\u2019s play. In addition some of the language used by a lot of youtubers can be seen as offensive and most would not want their children repeating what is said.\n\nThere is also a flood of content aimed at children with a [malicious intent](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-39381889) (such as the videos with the most popular random tags to generate views or videos made to look friendly only to have shock value)  with many still getting though the YouTube kids app.\n\nSo, that\u2019s why I have started this channel. The games I play will range between E for everyone and T for teens (e.g. overwatch). I will also be keeping the language clean.\n\nThis is the first time I have ever done video/sound editing as well as video game commentary. So it will be a learning process. I fear that it will start off abit cringey and low quality, but the more I do it the better I will get. \nAs of this post I have only a few videos on the channel but I aim to have at least 3 videos added each week.\n\nAnd as a final note, I just want to point out that I am not against violent or scary games and play them in my spare time myself. But having seen first-hand children\u2019s reactions to content that they were not ready for (I have met parents whose children as young as 3 have had nightmares about five nights at Freddy\u2019s and not being aware that the game was even from the horror genre or that their children were watching it).\n\nSo, I am the Good Natured Gamer. And I hope you and your family enjoy my videos."

I had felt almost numb to every emotion, normally I would resort to marijuana and drinking to help me experience raw emotion again, but over the past two months or so, weed and alcohol wasn't cutting it, and that was probably the lowest I had ever been.\n\nBut Recently I stopped smoking weed due to the fact that my stash ran out, and I didn't have any excess funds to spend on anymore. I haven't smoked in a little over 2 weeks and I honestly feel great! I hadn't really noticed any changes to my mood until the other day when I was walking home from class. Normally when I leave my apartment, I pick an album to listen to and treat that like my soundtrack for the day, but on Monday I forgot my headphones on my bed and left for school without them. This was a bit of a bummer at first, but I didn't really mind because it might prove to be a nice change. As I go through my day I attend the two classes I have that day, and during the gap between them I work on some homework in the library. After my classes are done I make my way over to the nearest bus stop, as I was standing there waiting for the bus I noticed that it was incredibly quiet and peaceful, which was not very typical as that area of campus is normally full of people and is currently under construction which normally generates alot of noise. But at that moment it was just me and someone else at the bus stop and a construction worker across the street watering some newly planted flowers in the dirt. I thought to myself \"wow, this is actually really nice.\" After standing for a few more minutes, the bus arrives and I climb on and casually take the bus all the way to the stop nearest my apartment. When I get off the bus I notice that it is incredibly peaceful here too, a little bit of construction on the new apartment complex across the street, and some younger kids getting off of their school bus talking with their friends about whatever it is kids talk about. \n\nI walked across the street from the bus stop and began walking up the hill toward home. The wind was just a calm breeze and it was probably around 65 \u00b0f outside and it felt wonderful. \n\nThese past few days have been some of the best couple of days I have had in a while, and they have blessed me with a much more positive attitude and given me a much brighter outlook on life.\n\nI'm not sure of how active this subreddit may be, as I just found it today, but I really just wanted to share.\n\nThanks for reading!\ud83d\ude03"

I saw them live for the first time yesterday and my SO made it spectacular by hiding me the whole night in his firm, comfortable clutch. We smoked a joint one day and I decided to earn a little attention from Tom and Serge utilizing my sense of humour and a rush of blood from such thrill. We talked about the upcoming gig and I decided to make a sign that says in bold, black, readable letters 'I love Saracuse' and bring it with me to flash at the concert. \n\nIt was beautiful; Tom [the lead singer] pointed at me twice, during the times I raised it. Then on a chattier, banter note he shared with Serge - he pointed at me and said \"Haha, I love Saracuse', I'm loving it\". Then Serge welcomely chimed in: \"haha, we see you\".\n\nThat was the best moment of my life."

My family recently moved to the states and I will be taking care of them because I am the eldest child. I have a good job lined up 10 days after graduation. I have a passion for electric guitar and dream to make something big out of it. I have plans to open up businesses that would enable me to leave my boring engineering job and focus on producing music later on. But the thought of how meaningless life is doesn't seem to escape my mind lately. \n\nSure, I will feel great accomplishing all my goals and dreams. To make my loved ones feel secure and happy. But when I wake up another Sunday after all that, nothing fundamentally is different. If I had woken up that same Sunday without having accomplished anything, how different would I really feel? I'm guessing not very.\n\nI'm not trying to make excuses not to work and chase after my dreams. In fact I will. I am just wondering whether 'living fast and dying young' would be more favorable than being cautious and growing old to me. I like the idea of drugs. I love being promiscuous. I love taking risks. And I never want to get married or have children. \n\nAt 45 years old, when I would have accomplished all my dreams, sitting on a chair smoking another cigarette on a rainy night; drunk, high and ready to die-  do you think I would regret not living a more normal, healthy life? Do you think I would regret not getting married and having kids? Because at this point in my life, I don't think I would. But I'd like someone with some wisdom/age on me to voice their opinion on whether I'm thinking in the right direction, or if following such a life would leave me in regret. "

I would always feel the necessity to lie , even when things where good I would still lie to make them feel a bit what do you say... interesting. I would always be very denial , have such crazy imagination of how things should be and would be , always made everything in my mind seem so easy. As I got older those tendencies got a lot worse , I began to over do them quite very often , to the point I was loosing myself in my own lies and imaginary thoughts , creating this so called perfect world in my head , it wasn't easy either growing up with out a father nor a man figure to guide me in to the what do you say ? Right steps. So I never truly got to experience that , nor a bunch of things. I never learned how to express myself never learned how to express how I felt due to being afraid of rejection and abandonment , always in fear of people discovering how weak I was in the inside , I was truly becoming a lost soul for a very long time I had lost sense of what reality was , stuck in lies , stuck with the very negative and poisonous way of thinking followed with the same kind of thoughts , I'm now 20 years old and even tho I still have a very lot to love and experience I'm very happy I am finally realizing this such tragic situation I was stuck on for the majority of my 20 year life , I hope everyone sees it one day and find themselves like I'm focusing on and trying to do , it takes a lot to get the point to where I am but am I to say I'm 20 there's people of out there who are twice my age who have gone through so much worse and are still trying to cope , depression is a real bitch if I may say.. it's what's stops he from doing such many great things.. it's like a brick holding you down as you sink in a deep pool trying to swim up and gasp for air , I hope I keep this up , I was in a very deep whole only reason why I never gave in to self harm was do to it being in the Bible and it being a very serious sin to commit, I'm not very quite religious but that I do believe , that was never the answer , just had to deal with it step by step 1 day at a time , there's this thing I read on here that said something like \" One bad day doesn't mean a bad life \" hope everyone find happiness and joy remember no one forces you to do anything in life there is no right way of doing things there is no right path but your path. There is never a perfect life but yours and what you make of it , please enjoy it we only get 1 shot at it "

My hope is that these stories will show people that happiness can be achieved right now, by anyone with whatever you have at your disposal. \n\n I want to show that no matter what your struggling with, happiness is always just one change of mind away. I really think you're stories will really change people's outlooks and lives.\n\nIf you have a story of discovering yourself, your dream, or finding true happiness after a deep struggle, please message me.\n\nYou can remain anonymous if you want but please be prepared to give a detailed account of your story via skype."

What would your life look like if you could forget the rules of the past, and redefine what happiness, purpose, and success mean for you?\n\nI have some fantastic news for you\u2026\n\nYou don\u2019t have to continue to live in Coedugoism, there is a solution to the unhappiness and misery in your life.\n\nAnd there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow because I\u2019ve found mine and will be showing you how to find yours!\n\nThe solution for you begins with 7 eye-opening transformational easy to follow steps that have been proven the world over by ancient wisdom practices and cutting-edge neuroscience research.\n\nThese two processes have been tested by millions of people in literally every area of the world.\n\nHere\u2019s the fantastic news for you. I\u2019ve taken these two processes intertwined them into an easy to follow system that eradicates the stress, worry, and anxiety in your life.\n\nThis not only gives you the much-needed relief you deserve but it\u2019s the precursor for creating continuous happiness and success in your life.\n\nThis is an unbelievably easy process you can start seeing results immediately in your daily life.\n\nMatter of fact, it is so simple you will think some of the steps are downright childish, ridiculous, and crazy, as I did until I started having unexpected remarkable results.\n\nThe universe set the foolish in the world to confound the wise\nHow Your Life Can Change From Misery To Bliss In A Moment\u2019s Notice\u2026\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that I was in the very same position you are now. Frustrated discouraged and just wanting to give up on it all.\n\nA world-wind of negative thoughts kept blowing through my mind day and night. It was always worsted at nights, just couldn\u2019t slow my mind down to go to sleep. If it wasn\u2019t my finances I was worrying about it was my job that I had become discontented with.\n\nI loved the actual work I was performing but it was everything else that went with it. The management sucked, some of the co-workers were unbearable, and the pay was downright ridiculous.\n\nIt just so happened one night while I was researching and reading about ancient wisdom practices and the cutting-edge neuroscience research that has been blossoming over the last decade or so, I stumbled upon an article.\n\nIt was a psychologist that had healed an entire ward of the criminally insane in a state prison.\n\nTo heal an entire cell block of insane prisoners was one thing, but the article stated he had accomplished this task without ever personally seeing or coming into contact with any of the inmates.\n\nYea Right, how do you heal someone from anything without ever seeing them in person? That was my question\u2026\n\nThe more I read the more intriguing this person became until I did a full-blown search to find out everything I could about this mysterious man of the mind and his practice.\n\nFinally, I began to find an article here and a video there until I ran across a course that he was teaching on the topic of his practice.\n\nWell, like anyone else, I couldn\u2019t just drop it there without knowing if this guy was a full-fledged idiot or if he really was on to something.\n\nSo, I purchased the course, wasn\u2019t much back then I think it was around $47.\n\nAs I was going through the course I remember nearly every page I read and every video I watched my response was, \u201cYea right, that\u2019s bullshit, there\u2019s no way that could work!\u201d\n\nBut everything was backed up by so-called recorded proof or unbelievable testimonies.\n\nNo one could have imagined, much less made up some of the crazy stuff they were speaking of.\n\nSounded ridiculous and way out there in La La Land, if you know what I mean.\n\nLike they weren\u2019t playing with a full deck of cards upstairs, but here they were, people just like me and you telling how remarkable the results they were getting.\n\nAfter a while, I finally had enough and decided I was going to prove to myself this was just a gimmick this guy was using to sell something, crap I\u2019d already paid the $47 so why not give it a try, I didn\u2019t have anything to lose.\n\nI could even get my money back with his guarantee if it didn\u2019t work, which I knew it wouldn\u2019t because it was stupid, simple, and crazy to think something this easy could possibly give the results being promised.\n\nSo I began, all the course basically was telling me was to use four little ancient wisdom mantras and orison throughout the day and your life would begin a positive change.\n\nThe course consisted of a lot of explanation on the what, when, and where of the matter but never the how.\n\nSo, what were my results, oh my God I could not believe what was happening when I would perform these practices.\n\nNo really, the results were not only remarkable they were unbelievable, but I had to believe them because they were happening in my own life concerning situations and issue in my family, friends, and most of all my co-workers.\n\nAfter putting it to the test in every situation I could think of time and time again, the same positive results manifested.\n\nAfter a year or so of testing this practice, I had a brainstorm to combine it with other results I\u2019d had from studies and research in the neuroscience field and created My Happiness Magic.\n\nWhere Ancient Wisdom Practices enhanced with Cutting-Edge Neuroscience Research produce results to being happy 75% of the time on a daily basis.\n\n\nOver the last couple of years, I have taught My Happiness Magic to family, friends, co-workers, and individuals all over the world.\n\nWith all finding basically the same results.\n\nNow to the final test, bringing the success of \u201cMy Happiness Magic\u201d to the masses, which is you.\n\nSo, you can run it through the ringer to prove it doesn\u2019t work, but I promise your efforts will be useless.\n\nThis works in every situation and every time for everyone.\n\nThe only catch is you must go by the rules religiously for it to work.\n\nNo matter how stupid, ridiculous, or crazy it may sound, for you to get the life-transforming results myself and others all over the world have received you have to abide by the rules.\n\nHOW This Mini-Series of Post on the Power of Happiness Will BENEFIT YOU in Your Daily Life\nThey will immediately give you tools or what I call your arsenal of weaponry & HOW to battle daily negativity in your life.\n\nThey will show you HOW to trigger 4 happy chemicals in your brain that will engulf your entire body with happiness instantly.\n\n\n\n\nThey will give you the razor\u2019s edge on HOW to cut through any difficult issues that arise in your life and that includes a complaining disrespectful boss or unpleasant SOB co-worker\n\nThey will teach you HOW to start your day off as the Champion in Life You are meant to be, HAPPY with fulfillment.\n\nNext: Let The Prelude to The Controversial & Magical Power Of Happiness  Begin at happipappi.com\n "

            "value": "Grocery Shopping- Finding happiness one aisle at a time\n\nToday we\u2019re going to talk about another chore that all of you have most likely experienced at some point in your life, grocery shopping. I say \u2018some point in your life\u2019 because there\u2019s the people who go to the grocery store regularly, then there are the people who have a family member going on their behalf, but they still go to the grocery store to pick up the things that they felt were \u2018missed\u2019 (we were all teenagers once who thought we could shop better than our parents). As \u2018grocery shopping\u2019 is typically referred to as a household chore (like vacuuming or doing the laundry), it can be difficult to find joy in it at first glance, but with just a bit of perspective, it\u2019s easy to see why going can be more of a treat than a chore. That\u2019s what the Spire is here for, so let\u2019s get started!\n\nAt first glance, a grocery store can appear daunting\u2026brightly lit and exceedingly crowded, with aisle after aisle of different choices (stores can have from 30,000 to over 100,000 different items in them). However, with a bit of practice, a grocery store can become a special place that you can feel proud of for mastering. Also, a grocery store can sometimes remind you of how kind people can be; in my trip their yesterday, four people let me go ahead of them when there was gridlock in an aisle, while two additional people gave me friendly recommendations when I was comparing two products side-by-side. If you prefer a less-crowded experience than there are 24-hour grocery stores too (back in University, my roommate and I made our 2am grocery shopping a tradition\u2026just us and the aisles, even in whiteout snowstorms).\n\nThe one thing that grocery shopping offers you more than anything else is choices, the ultimate in making personal & family choices. First off, most major cities/towns have multiple grocery store choices, from local farmer\u2019s markets to big-box superstores, meaning you have variety, and some people take this variety to the next level- I\u2019ll get my apples here but I\u2019ll get my bread from that market over there. In many ways, your grocery store can bring you closer to your community and the world- that bread was made in store (six feet to your left), while those oranges are from Mexico, and so on. Due to this variety as well, you are able to express your individuality with your cart. No two people\u2019s carts are the same, it\u2019s all different, based on a lifetime of evolving personal preference.\n\nFor those of you who feel a bit overwhelmed by the choices, it is quite popular (between 40-60% of people) to bring a list with you, since you have an idea of what you need for the coming days/weeks. This shows forward-thinking and is a wonderful skill to have, and already puts you out to a head-start when you get there.\n\nA grocery store is also designed to be pleasantly overwhelming for your senses. What do I mean by that? I refer to the fact that you\u2019re drooling when you pick up the scent of freshly baked bread & cake from the bakery, or the brightly coloured fruits & vegetables lining the produce aisles. Also, as a kid, maybe you got your hands on those little carts with the flags on them, so you could \u2018help\u2019 your parents shop. As an adult, maybe as you turn the cart sharply, maybe you made the noise of brakes screeching, feeling like you\u2019re playing Need for Speed as a teenager. Also, just try to say that at least once you were not caught dancing/singing in an aisle when a song came over the speakers that you enjoyed.\n\nA grocery store is also a setting where eventually you will develop your own general knowledge of how to shop that will make you more efficient and your experience will be a happier one. Check your eggs in the carton, don\u2019t put the laundry detergent on top of the bread, and don\u2019t buy bananas that have turned brown. Chances are you knew those already, but be happy that you do! You are the master of the groceries, and champion of the aisles; the produce will tremble before your keen eye for detail.\n\nWhen you finally come to the line-up, you may think that your happiness is going to come to an end, but wait! There\u2019s that magazine you won\u2019t buy but you\u2019ll comment on the headlines (\u201cShe\u2019s dating him?\u201d, \u201cHe did what with who?!\u201d), that lady only has three items- you let her in front of you (Good job grocery superstar!), how does that cashier know thousands of produce codes?! (Don\u2019t tell me that there\u2019s a rolodex/guidebook right there, or a pattern, I like thinking that grocery store cashiers are bestowed with magical powers when they start working there).\n\nAlso, you may be on a diet or displeased with your grocery choices for whatever reason, but usually everyone has at least one thing that they buy that they\u2019re really excited about (for some of you, this item may not make it home to the cupboard- your own personal reward for getting out of there- like you\u2019re Indiana Jones running away from the boulder while clutching the golden idol). Also, be excited about everything that\u2019s in your cart! You\u2019re trying to take care of yourself\u2026and possibly your family (however big or small it may be), and that\u2019s a wonderful thing. Taking care of the meals & what your children, significant other, roommate, etc. eat is a great expression of love for them, since it\u2019s a staple of living. Eventually you\u2019ll be back home and your cupboard stocked, your plunder from your latest excursion!\n\nSo, as you can see, grocery shopping can be a fun & pleasant experience, as well as an opportunity for you to showcase your street-smarts in the grocery store. It\u2019s a weekly/bi-weekly adventure, and you\u2019re ready for it, so take a deep breath and dive in, we\u2019re all in this together. Cart drivers, start your engines! We\u2019ve got sixteen aisles to get through, and our navigator is ready with the list! Let\u2019s roll, and I\u2019ll see you on the second-turn in the bakery!"

            "value": "Hello Fellow Reddits, \n\nThere is a far greater need for more happiness in the world, than I need to get paid for this little e-book I'm sharing with all of you for free. I created this out of my own desire to find my way out of anxiety. I hope this bullet list gives you a little boost and insight into maintaining happiness.\n\nThe Two Most Important Rules of a Happy & Successful Life are... \nLove yourself and love others. Sounds easy, right? But what does that really mean?  How do we do that? How do we achieve that state of being? There are many layers to it.\n\nLoving yourself means:\n\n-CHOOSE to be a CREATOR of your life - rather than a VICTIM.\nIt is time to decide what is most important to you. Love, hate, fear or doubt? Funny as it sounds, these are the choices you are making in every moment. Hate is based on what you feel has already happened to you. Fear is worrying about what might happen. Doubt is worrying about what might not. It is up to you to be in that state of love and choose it rather than be a victim of the other three. Do you choose to be a victim? Or do you choose to be a creator/lover? It\u2019s that simple - that you see every choice you make as those choices. You are either creating your life with confident love, or allowing others to create your reality for you because you may feel like a powerless victim.\n\n-Living in the \u201cnow\u201d moment/the present.\nBeing clear of anger, fear or doubt. (When you recognize these 3 main feelings that are blocking you, you can be happy because now you know where you are stuck. Realize none of these are happening in the NOW. ) -Know that the majority of what you think about is not actually happening now, so enjoy the present. If the present is an unhappy one, it can and will change. It is temporary and fleeting.\nKnow yourself. Take time to spend alone to really get to the core of what your heart's desire is and what your core values are, without pressure of time, money or influence of others. Allow yourself to be more of who YOU truly are. In result, you will attract things to you more effortlessly because you are in your natural flow, your natural state of being, more naturally YOU.\n\n-STAY AWAKE to your dream. Nothing like a cold slap in the face to remind you what your passion, desires and values are. When you fall off track, get too comfortable and stop growing, learning and living in our passion, your desired state of being, life will get your attention with a very big CONTRAST to your current focus. The more you ignore the realization and reality of yourself, the more uncomfortable that lesson and awareness awakening will be. Stay on track with your heart, values and desire and life will be easier! Connect to YOU, what you love to do and how you can do more of it. Make a top 10 list of \u201cdesirable states of being\u201d (flowing, abundant, happy, etc.) and stick to it.\n\n-Determination.\nDon't give up on yourself or your dreams. Determination is what will carry you through to the end. Rather than being in a state of hope, wishing or wanting - be determined. Rather than speak about what you wish, want and aspire to, speak from a place of \u201cI am going to, I am doing, I am living this, I am being this, I choose, I love\u201d etc. \nThe majority of people who are happy and successful in life know that when they set goals and take that first step towards their dreams and desires, they don't expect immediate results, and they expect failures and challenges along the way. But, they are determined to keep moving closer to their dream. They aren't afraid to say no to things that are not aligned with their integrity and values for fear of loss of success or loss of love.\n\n-Respect yourself.\nAsk for what you need and be vulnerable, humble and transparent enough to do so.\nDo not allow others to harm you repeatedly. Have clear boundaries, voice them and follow through on those promises to yourself to respect yourself. Make a list of how to respect yourself and make it so! Keep good friends that will support you in respecting yourself and your needs.\n\n-Self-care of your body, health, mind and spirit is important for a happy life. Focus on taking good care of yourself. Eat healthy, get outside and enjoy the fresh air, exercise, get plenty of sleep and go easy on yourself when things don't go well. \n\n-Take nothing personally.\nRealize that what others say to you or about you speaks volumes about them and how happy or unhappy they are. If someone speaks bad about you or someone else, it's because they feel powerless or are unable to resolve or confront the issue at hand. To believe how someone acts towards you or what they do or say to you is all about you, is like believing their whole world and life has revolved around you. Their \"bad day\" or \"assholisms\" are not totally, or sometimes not even at all, about you. Their whole life has built up to this state of being in them. Step back witness, but don't invite or allow it into your state of being.\n\nIf you already have taken something personally, forgive them. Rather, forgiveness is even a judgment that they intentionally wronged you, so just chalk it up to their suffering that they could not fix, that they wanted to give away or needed help with and it was nothing personal about you. LET IT GO! Don't wait for an apology, because you will be the only one who suffers while you wait for it.\n\nFind support and comfort in what is CONSTANT and not FLEETING. Here are some things that are Constants in life.\nNature \u2013 A walk in the woods or laying on the grass can change any mood. Did you know the health benefits of walking barefoot on the grass.. called Earthing? Were you aware that the negative ions found near a stream or mountaintop, magnetic field of the earth and the infrared ray of the sun were all put there to keep you happy, pain and stress-free? When was the last time you laid on the grass or walked barefoot outside? Try it!! It works well on headaches!\n\n-God \u2013 The one you can always count on to ask for help, forgiveness, strength and more! Or whatever you believe in. The flying spaghetti monster also works.\n\n-Connection \u2013 Connect with people, animals, children, birds, trees, communities, groups, teams, families like yours, friends far and near, and strangers. Just notice them, feel their inner happiness (no matter how small), their smile and just connect without words, or connect with a kind gesture.\n\n-Love (found in the observation and appreciation of examples of the love you connect with, that inspires you, like sweet couples, tropical breezes on your skin, warm sun, flowers, a kind word, or performing kindness to someone else) Don't wait for it! BE IT! GROW IT!\nYour consistency with your conscious choices! This not only means setting your values standard, sticking to it, saying no to old patterns, but it takes a little extra effort on your part. This could mean a daily ritual to line up with, invite, accept, feel and embody the greater parts of you that you know you are. (Rather than waking with stress and talking of your strife.) Daily connection, practice and tuning in to your desired state of being is important. Underneath all this illusion, you are that desired state of being already. You are that being. Uncovering this part of you, and being clear about what that is will open your body, aliveness and new doors more effortlessly. DO WHAT YOU LOVE & BE IT CONSISTENTLY!\n\nTo say further, DREAM A BETTER DREAM! If you don't like your experience or how you feel, then change it. There is always going to be bad and good to focus on. You get to choose which one you want to spend the most time thinking about and feeling. \n\n\u201cFeelings are powerful, use them to your advantage. \nFeel, feel, feel and vibes of passion and success will wash over you.\u201d\n\nLoving others means:\n\n-Having compassion for their journey.\nLove their humanness. We all have hurts, challenges and curve balls thrown at us. We are doing our best to figure out this world. We've all done our best and our worst. This life does not come with an instruction manual. Appreciating their human journey allows you to step back and see the bigger picture and have compassion for them and how they act out of fear and survival mode.\nKnow that others treat you as someone has treated them before. It is learned and repeated. They will test you to be a part of their lesson and play. It is up to you if you want to play the other half of that role or not. Or you can choose to be a witness in the audience as they act out their healing process from their own pain. Have compassion for their suffering and their self-limiting beliefs, and open a space for love for them to step into with you.\n\n-Don't judge them.\nWho are we to know what is bad or good? Even in our own experience? Some of our worst of times, where we appeared helpless, and weak to others, was exactly what we need to go through to become who we are. We are all experiencing and expressing life in a very different way, to one path - Love. Give a little more love to those who may need a kind word or an open, non-judgmental friend to talk to. Judgment creates separateness, hatred and war. Small feelings can grow big; use the good ones and eliminate pollution in our universal mental pool.\n\n-Having gratitude for their role in your life.\nOften others are a hard reflection or teacher in our lives. Each one is a mirror for us to see where our weaknesses and self doubt are, and an opportunity to choose, to be bold and vulnerable enough to love ourselves, respect ourselves and take nothing personally. They represent a hard mirror for us to change what we see in that reflection. With this mirror, we can choose to just love ourselves and not be convinced by the ugly image they project onto that mirror. They test our level of reaction and attachment to things outside of ourselves. The less we react, the more enlightened and happy we become. We are like an open window, where things can pass through, but not stick. We are empty and free of attachments to outcomes, opinions and other fleeting experiences. We are free to be compassionate and unaffected by the outside world. We are empowered with love for ourselves and for others within.\nDo no harm with your opinions or actions. It will only come back to you and hurt you in another way.\n\n-Empowering them, not enabling or being a crutch. (Being of service without being a martyr.)\nKnowing how to set healthy boundaries is an important part of having healthy relationships. When you are there to empower someone, you give them their power back. You do not carry the weight of their dependency on happiness and success. You offer tools, you give them ideas and share wisdom when asked. But offering all this without being asked will fall on deaf ears and be highly ineffective and under-appreciated. Be of service to them, without sacrificing yourself or your happiness. Now if you are like someone like Gandhi, you will enjoy serving others and sacrificing everything in order to serve them. Or if someone is sick and unable to take care of themselves, that is a different story. As long as you are not expecting anything in return from them, and it is true selfless service.\n\nHope this little bullet list was helpful y'all. Life is not always easy, but a little focus list like this can help keep you in check!\n\n\nCindy \nwww.zerotooneness.com \n"

I try to tell this to everyone I have taught.\n\nI've recently started teaching crafts to people in the area I live in now but am becoming dismayed and drained by the attitude of some of my students. They say \"I suck, I can't do this, this is stupid, I should give up, I should just go to the store and buy this instead of making it myself, ect\" right from the start of the class when they hit the first point something is difficult.\n\nI help them through it and most of the time they walk away surprised that they've made something great by the end of the class. \n\nHow can I counter these initial negative thoughts and expressions when beginning to teach a new skill? (Most of my students are adults and much older than me.) \n\nI want them to believe in themselves and know that they can and will be able to make something when they keep trying. I don't want to feel drained at the end of the class because of the negativity even though it was mostly positive in the end.  \n\nThese are not easy crafts, you can't 'get it' in under a minute and you can't master it in a day let alone a month. (I have been doing this for over 10 years and I have tried my best to make things simple for beginners. I want to share my craft with others because it's something I enjoy immensely but I feel like the attitude I'm receiving is not that of excitement and desire to put in effort.)\n\nI try my best to be encouraging and honest - none of them are actually doing poorly and they work so fast once it 'clicks'! Any advice for how to counter this in the future would be greatly appreciated. As I said, I want to spread my craft with others who can appreciate it and don't want to give up on this job. (It's hard because I'm such a nerd about it and still excited about new projects all the time!)\n\nThank you to anyone who reads this and I hope I can get some insight on how to stay positive in this situation! :)"

This keeps you thinking about gratitude without having to stop everything and put a journal entry in.\n\nIt has a collection of gratitude mantras and quotes you can choose for the reminders or you can even create your own. The feature I\u2019m most proud of is that you can choose a photo to accompany the reminder. When I have been testing it I have selected a lot of photos of my cat, and times with friends, but you can also use the default photos as well.\n \nIf you would like to check it out and give me some feedback these are the links:\n\n1. Download here:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/app/id1225870938\n\n2. Then go to this link to upgrade for free:\nhttp://www.unattendedunicorn.com/apps/gratitude/free-upgrade.html\n\nThe free upgrade lets you choose unlimited reminders and create your own, and allows you to add your own custom photos.\n\nI hope you find it useful and please, please comment if you have any feedback!\n\nThanks,\n\nRich"

Or you may have little more than the shoes on your feet yet overflow with joy, because happiness is a state of mind. If you want to be truly happy, you've got to look to yourself because true happiness comes from within.\n\nAllow yourself to be immersed in whatever it is you\u2019re doing right now, and take time to really be in the present moment.Life is too short to wait to be happy.You know what makes you feel good, use some simple ideas to make your day a bit more joyful.\n\nSins that make happiness very hard to come by -\n\nComparing Yourself to Others\n\nTalking About Your Dreams Instead of Going to Work on Them\n\nListening to People With Nothing Positive to Say\n\nFocusing on the News\n\nDeciding Someone Else Needs to Change\n\nThinking \u201cHappiness\u201d Is a Destination You Can Reach\n\nForgetting to Say \u201cThank You\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to take for granted all that you have.\n\nAvoid replaying past negative events in your head or worrying about the future.\n\nHappiness is based on worldly accomplishments.\n\nDon't be regretful for what you don't have.\n\n \n\nThese are some of our common mistakes/biases/mind blocks to happiness, which is a universal and pure feeling to which every individual has a right. It comes from very simple time moments and the maximum happiness is often a result of a trivial action such a smile of a infant or my favourite team on victory. Time has been memorial that happiness comes to those who are content and satisfied and the ones who are greedy and dishonest.\n\nRemove the blocks to your pathway to heaven. Yes !! Happiness is the pathway to heaven and it is right here on earth for us to feel and be a part of it.\n\n\nFirst published on gainhappinessnow.blogspot.com"

            "value": "Hello,  Reddit!  My life has been  tennis match between pessimism and optimism.  For a little while it seemed like it was optimism's game... but over the past 5 years,  pessimism has been dominating. \n\nLet me start by saying,  in my line of work... optimism is key.  I am a special education teacher.  For the past 21 years,  I've always put the positive spin on every situation that occurred with my students to make them realize life doesn't  suck.  I am also married and the father of two young children.  I always have to be an the optimist.  This being said... It's not my nature.  My parents were worriers.  They worried about everything.  This became my nature.  When I was 14,  I remember having a panic attack because one of my friends told me the planets were aligning and Earth was going to have massive earthquakes and tsunamis.  Needless to say it didn't happen,  the only thing shaken up was me.  As I got older I learned to put on a \"tough guy\"  exterior.  Tried not to show my friends and family what was going on inside. Going back... at 8 years old,  I found my grandpa dead on the kitchen floor. I went in to call him for dinner... He had a massive heart attack.  There's nothing you can do to unscar an 8 year old from that.  The idea of death (more so the fear of losing my loved ones )  loomed in the background of my thoughts.  While in my early 30s, my 13 year old cousin passed way from muscular dystrophy.  I was there with him after he passed.  He was still sitting up in his bed.  Messed me up.  He was also mentally handicapped.  It was like losing a baby.  During the events of 9-11 and the aftermath... I was falling apart (I live 15 minutes outside NYC.) Didn't know what to think.  I was so happy I was getting married the next year... but would I make it to my wedding? Was this the beginning of WW3? Threw myself into a life of optimism.  Felt great.  Started looking at the glass half full.  I knew it felt right.  Problems in the first year of marriage threw me into a depression.  We almost split up,  but realized we loved each other too much to let it go.  In 2007, I had my daughter...it was an amazing experience.  In 2013 after years of not being able to conceive a second child and a bunch of fertility drugs... we had our second child,  a boy.  During that pregnancy,  the doctor told my wife the placenta was attached to her uterus... There was a risk she could die.  She was prepping me for life without her.   \nI'm 45...my family is healthy,  my parents are living... I have all to be thankful for. My wife is difficult,  my kids are difficult,  and we struggle financially,  but we're together and we love each other.  The problem is,  I can't get back the brief year of optimism I had before I got married.  I fake it well for a those around me, but inside... I fear the future and for the safety of those I love.  I know it's irrational.  I know I can get back my sense of optimism. Just need help.  Any ideas or links to stuff that will push me in the right direction.  Thanks!!!! "

Her husband of 70 years recently passed away, making the move necessary. After many hours of waiting patiently in the lobby of the nursing home, she smiled sweetly when told her room was ready. As she maneuvered her walker to the elevator, I provided a visual description of her tiny room, including the eyelet sheets that had been hung on her window. \u201cI love it,\u201d she stated with the enthusiasm of an eight-year-old having just been presented with a new puppy. \u201cMrs. Jones, you haven\u2019t seen the room \u2026. just wait.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it,\u201d she replied. \u201cHappiness is something you decide on ahead of time. Whether I like my room or not doesn\u2019t depend on how the furniture is arranged, it\u2019s how I arrange my mind. I already decided to love it. It\u2019s a decision I make every morning when I wake up. I have a choice; I can spend the day in bed recounting the difficulty I have with the parts of my body that no longer work, or get out of bed and be thankful for the ones that do. Each day is a gift, and as long as my eyes open I\u2019ll focus on the new day and all the happy memories I\u2019ve stored away, just for this time in my life.\u201d She went on to explain, \u201cOld age is like a bank account, you withdraw from what you\u2019ve put in. So, my advice to you would be to deposit a lot of happiness in the bank account of memories Thank you for your part in filling my Memory bank. I am still depositing.\u201d And with a smile, she said: \u201cRemember the five simple rules to be happy: 1. Free your heart from hatred. 2. Free your mind from worries. 3. Live simply. 4. Give more. 5. Expect less."

You don't have to be popular or have everything you want to be happy. The things that make life worth living are the moments. Some are good, some are bad. But even during the bad ones, life goes on. You can choose to live in a sad state of depression all the time and become bored with life and grow complacent or you can choose to live life to the fullest. You can choose to have a happy life. You don't need lots of friends or money. A few close friends are a lot better than a bunch of acquaintances. Choose to live life for the moments. Choose to look at the sun rather than the shadows. Come out of the shell. Smile a bit. People will always try to hurt you. Instead of hurting others, do things that are mutually beneficial. Because helping others makes life worth living. And you only have one life. So choose to live it well. Choose to love."

It's been a long road but I finally got cleared to look for a job a few months ago.\n\nI was offered a position a couple weeks ago but I was waiting to celebrate in fear that I wouldn't pass the background check. Well, looks like everything is good and I START MY NEW JOB ON MONDAY!\n\nIt's a great job! I have not worked in 15 months so this is huge. I'll be 1 year clean on the 26th. Life is wonderful! I'm so happy and I never thought I'd say this but...life is wonderful!"
