Why is it now practiced so that the video either continues playing or requires multiple presses to finally do it's fucking function? Have you no god damn courtesy?\n\nWhen I say 'Pause' - you fucking pause! When I want to mute you because maybe my volume is loud or something. You don't just find a way to unmute yourself or make it frustrating so that your volume control is shrunk or barely works like the other buttons.\n\nYes, there are video players out there that disregards even your input for volume control. For example, a lot of local news sites have video players tucked into parts of their site. Where, you silence one of them and another damn one continues on and once you thought you've got them all.

A for Asshat.\n\nI don't know what insecurities you struggled with as a kid, and I don't care. You manage to turn EVERYTHING into a pissing contest. \n\nIT'S NOT IMPRESSIVE, MAN. It's embarrassing. You are EMBARRASSING. Our mutual friends don't want to come over any more because none of them can stand you. I can't verify whether or not your stories are true, but even if they are, you're not winning points by one-upping everyone in the room.\n\nAND YOU DO IT CONSTANTLY. ALL THE TIME. I've got a bad cold. Well, one time, you had brain fever and nearly died. I saw the Black Keys live. The Black Keys are laaaaaaaaame-o, but you drank beers backstage with a much cooler band once. I saved up for weeks to buy myself a nice TV. You have a NICER TV at home, and it's more expensive and it's brand name.\n\n**Me: \"Heading to Pathmark. You need anything?\" \nJ: \"Ewww, Pathmark? Whole Foods is the only place I ever get MY groceries. I ONLY eat gourmet.\"**\n\nWELL FUCK YOU, FANCYPANTS!\n\nI get it. You're a foodie.

You've never had pan-seared baby jackalope sauteed in unicorn blood?\"* NO. NO I HAVE NOT. YOU ARE ONLY ASKING BECAUSE YOU ALREADY KNOW I HAVEN'T.\n\nOn that note, for FUCK'S SAKE, mate. You do not do HALF of the shit you talk about. One time, just to test a theory, I made up a restaurant and told you about it. You apparently go there every time you visit the city.\n\nNormally, we all just wait until you're not around and then make fun of you. But the other day, you crossed the fucking line.\n\nYou make really bad \"your mom\" jokes. \n**Me: \"Can you pass the plate?\" \nJ: \"Your mom's a plate.\"**\nAnd so on. But, buddy, you crossed a fucking line.\n\n**Me: \"I don't think waiting in front of the microwave for popcorn is going to give me cancer.\" \nJ: \"Your mom has cancer.\"**\n\nYou do NOT get to joke about that, you little piss-rag. My mother IS sick. We don't know what it is yet. Doctors have looked, and they're not sure. Cancer is a possibility. I politely asked you not to go there. I was offended, but I wasn't mad\u2026yet. A simple sorry would have sufficed. I'd even take a \"my bad.\" But you know what you said? You know what the fuck you said?\n\n**\"Well, lots of people in MY family have died of cancer, so\u2026\"**\n\nYOU CAN'T DEFLATE YOUR EGO FOR ONE SECOND TO ADMIT THAT WHAT YOU SAID WAS FUCKING RUDE? Bad jokes happen. We slip and accidentally say awful, badly timed things. But don't you fucking try to tell me that an terminal illness in YOUR family invalidates one in MINE, you little shit. You don't work for anything you own. Your parents pay your rent and buy your fucking groceries. You come home from your two hour math class and whine about how exhausted you are. NO, PART -TIME STUDENT IS NOT \"TECHNICALLY\" YOUR JOB. \n\nYou BRAG about never having had a real job. BRAG. LIKE YOU'RE PROUD OF THAT. And then you have the balls to fucking tell me that I should be earning twice what I'm making, and that I'm silly for accepting anything less than $50/hour STRAIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE.\n\nIF I WERE MAKING $50 A FUCKNG HOUR, I WOULDN'T BE LIVING WITH YOU. YOU ARE 22 YEARS OLD AND YOU STILL HAVE AN ALLOWANCE. Do not fucking tell me how much I should be earning. You don't know JACK SHIT about earning. \n\nWhat sucks the most is that, once you get past all that shit, you're actually a decent guy. You're funny, mostly good natured, and you can be generous. But all of that is eclipsed by your massive Kanye Complex. You are trying way too hard to impress, and it shows. **Cut it out. You're losing friends.**\n\nThanks for listening, Reddit :D\n"

The bank withdrew the amount that they gave me at first leaving me in the negative.\n\nAfter telling me promptly to fuck off even though I had printed evidence of foolery on my account, I was left with an account in the negative hundreds days before my daughter is born. My next check at work will be next to nothing due to holidays off plus hospital days, so I got that and my account is now at $1 \n\nI was waiting on a package In the mail all this time too 1 of 2, which the other came.  I experienced LOTS of problems with this damn box. Sent to the wrong state twice! Then when it got to my city like, right by m y house, it was marked as delivered. I stand outside everyday waiting on the mail. It never came. He never came that day. I just got off the phone with the post service. They promptly told me to fuck off. They gave me the run around all day so I went up there when I got off work.\n\nAfter taking a number, and waiting forever and a day In line, I got to the clerk who told me to go wait at the other (empty) spot at the end. She told the manager to come help me and the manager (which was 5 fucking feet away literally) said \"okay here I come\" and then proceeded to promptly die for 20 minutes while I stood there, stood there, went outside to check on my truck, came back, and stood there. The original clerk looked at me sideways and asked if I had been helped. I said no. She called the lady over again and this time she came running like she knew she fucked up. \n\nShe walked away came back and told me they would call me by 5. When I called them at 6 after they didn't call me. She said that the carrier said that he had delivered the package today. Which he fucking hadnt. It was a completely different package my girlfriend was expecting. So no. Then I gave her the tracking number she just goes \"well, the tracking said it was delivered blah blah fucking blah\" I proceed to inform her that that's the WHOLE REASON WHY IM CALLING! she says \"well all of our carriers are good people and wouldn't steal, let me give you the number to file a claim\". I decline and hang up. Pissed. Angry. Feeling totally fucked over. Sorry for spelling my autocorrect is making me more angry than I initially was. It has been a challenging month.\n\noh yeah, and in the middle of all this, I was racially profiled and put on child support without the consent or acknowledgement of myself, or my wife. As I'd they saw me, didn't like what they saw for some reason and assumed I was a deadbeat. I work HARD I pay my taxes, I donate to charities when I can, and most of all we LIVE together so why the fuck would they intervene and manipulate my financial balance!? If I lose my job I could end up in jail like my father did for the same reason. He still can't get a job without child support agencies fucking with his money. And they will for the rest of his life. I don't want that handcuff. This is all bullshit."

If you actually had a disagreement that was legit toward the information being taught, I would be more than intrigued for a good debate, but when you scream shit along the lines of \"THAT'S BULLSHIT!\" at least back up your claim.\n\nSecondly, you shouldn't be surprised that no one wants to be your partner on class projects, since all you do would is steal credit on who did what, and hinder our project by bringing up your \"men problems\" about them being all over you since YOU'RE SO DAMN ATTRACTIVE. Personally, I don't think that's physically possible, and while I'm still on this subject, you know what's actually attractive? NOT TELLING YOUR MEN PROBLEMS TO OTHER MEN!\n\nThirdly, fuck you, and I mean that in the most non-sexual way. Just fuck you.

We had to be running around and going places to keep them on schedule for napping and bedtime. \n\nIt just really gets under my skin to see these Facebook timelines that are a facade of truth. They're carefully polished to make parenting look like a hip magazine. Posting these perfect, enhanced photos or staging minor dramas only to write mini blogs about how they \"deal\" is so awkward to witness. I can't help but wonder how often they actually give their kid's real eye contact.\n\nThe really sad part is that I know these people in real time. They're all a mess. And hey - be a mess. I'm a mess. But don't be weird and pretend you're not to create some illusion of being put together. That helps no one. Certainly not your kids.   \n\nI'll get on Facebook late in the evening when I can't sleep and check out what I've missed. My brother or a couple of friends will always have several posts within an hour of one another - showcasing their day.

He's married and I talk to my SiL much more often than him... even if half the time they need stuff for the kids. I don't think she's held a steady job since they've been married, she's been doing the stay-at-home-mom route. So he's been the bread winner. I know he doesn't make much and they have three kids. So anytime he's behind on a bill or anything, I get the \"hey, can you give me $150-300 to cover X,Y,Z?\" Which is normally not a problem. We always give them something to cover it, even if we can't give them the whole amount before our next payday.    (Of which, he's never offered to pay any of it back.)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSo my hubby and I... We bought their kid's everything the first Christmas they were married because they didn't have money. We've bought damn near everything for the first three or four Christmases. We have still given PLENTY for Christmas for the last two years because money's been tight for my Brother and SiL. We buy the kids a couple of outfits and shoes for school each year. We buy them winter coats. We don't mind buying stuff for the kiddos. (Regardless of the fact that only one is my brother's and the other two were brought in from a previous relationship from her before they married. We buy for ALL the kids.)    \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n  \nSo my brother calls. Says they're shutting down their franchise business because it's hemorrhaging money. Says he let someone tell him it was okay to spend the sales tax money he had on his personal things 'for the moment' and to make it up later with future sales. I'm expecting $100-300 to be asked for... since that's normal. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nNo. That motherfucker wanted me to take out a fucking personal fucking loan for $5,000 and let him make the payments on it. Are you fucking kidding me? $5,000?! As a fucking bank loan? NO. Not no, but hell fucking no. At this point, I'm speechless and seeing red. I told him no. That it wasn't happening, and it was a bit ridiculous.  And this fucking ungrateful asshole goes \"Yeah. I figured you'd say no. I guess some siblings just care enough and other siblings don't care at all\" and then hangs up on me. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAre you bloody fucking kidding me? After the fucking money (it was well over $1,000 that we've given him over the years) and all the fucking shit we've bought for your damn kids... I don't fucking care? Ungrateful ASSHOLE! I'm beyond fucking livid. HOW FUCKING DARE HE ASK ME TO TAKE OUT A FUCKING $5,000 PERSONAL LOAN FOR HIM! AND HOW FUCKING DARE HE TELL ME I'M A SHITTY SIBLING FOR REFUSING."

            "value": "When you broke up with me, we parted on good terms. We had had a long and happy relationship, and I believed you when you said you just didn't feel the romance anymore. To be honest, I could have seen it coming, but I didn't. Near the end you kept coming home late and confronting me, saying I wasn't investing enough in the relationship. In those moments, I should have said that I was the one waiting for you to come home, to have a night just for us, while you were hanging out with Ben, venting about me. But I didn't, because like any guy, especially me, I assumed I was in the wrong. I loved you, and our dog, and I would do anything to make you happy. So I would promise to try harder, to do better, and I would. But it was never enough. When you kept asking me whether **I** wanted to dump **you**, I should have seen what was going on.\n\nHonestly, I liked Ben. He was funny, we liked similar stuff, and he was a genuinely nice person. And beyond that, I never questioned your intentions because to be frank, I figured he was much less attractive than me, so what's the worst that could happen. When you came home at 3 am, because you had gone to his house, both got drunk, and fallen asleep, I trusted you. When he invited you on an overnight hike, I knew you had wanted to go hiking, and I trusted you, hell, I facilitated you getting gear.\n\nAnd I still believe you when you told me that nothing happened.\n\nYou gave me a week and a half to move out, to spend some quality time with our dog, before you made me move back in with my parents. It didn't help that the day you asked me to move out on was my birthday, but what could you do, you needed a place to sleep once you get back from New York. I could have afforded to move out on my own, had you not convinced me that if we didn't go on a vacation to end all vacations that summer, because you'd be doing grad school soon, and couldn't possibly travel during that. So we had to go. I could have afforded to move out if you had listened to me when I said we don't need to be spending so much on groceries. We don't need the fresh bread from Pete's, we don't need organic Avocados, and an endless supply of almond milk. I could have afforded to move out if you had listened when I said we can't afford to go out to dinner at the hippest restaurants every weekend. You knew I was scrounging for cash at the start of the semester, yet you couldn't make the connection that I kept paying for things for you, but not working.\n\n\nIt took me a lot of time to get used to being alone again. Building your life around somebody for five years turns out to be a bad plan when they leave you. You lose skills, you build habits, and nothing feels the same. You spend nights just sitting around, trying to figure out what people do. But I was getting through it. I got back into some of my hobbies, I reconnected with friends, and found communities. Even if I didn't want to get press ganged into singing in my parents church's choir, I appreciated having those people around me who were always interested in how I was doing. Plus, it got me an excuse to get the car into the city so I could pick up Mia (Our dog) to have some visits. That was part of what got me through. Having days where I could just lounge around with her, show her off to the family visiting for Christmas. Sure, it sucked when you would text me saying that **I** needed to clip her nails because her foot was hurting, and I spent half an hour in the bathroom crying because even though this was the first I had see of my dog in three weeks, I was being forced to play bad cop, but I figured you were small and alone, and greyhounds are big and strong. Maybe you just couldn't do it.\n\nWhen I went to pick up Mia the morning of NYE, I honestly was feeling good, and feeling almost guilty as if I was doing too well. I had felt guilty when I decided to try and get out back into the world, even though you had dumped me. I felt like I was betraying you, like I owed you some respect for what we had had. Some might think it was weird that I still had a key to your apartment, but we both figured that I should be able to pick Mia up even if you're not their, and I would most of the time prefer that to be the case. When I turned the key and it was already unlocked I figured it was like last time, and you had forgotten to lock your door. To be fair, I had told you when I was coming, even if you thought I was at choir, you could have planned ahead, and I was already 45 minutes later than I expected.\n\nWhen I saw Ben brushing his teeth, all I had was shock. But I played it cool, said hi, you gave me her stuff and I was off. But I know what you were thinking. \n\nI understand why you tried to hide it from me. And I don't fault our friends for not telling me, it wasn't there information to tell. But when you said that nothing had happened when we were together, I believed you, and I still do. But that doesn't change the truth. It doesn't change that a month and change is a pretty small amount of time after a breakup to have somebody sleeping over with their own tooth brush, especially given that both of us had only had one long term relationship. Hell, I was feeling guilty that I even had tinder.\n\nI remember in the hours after we broke up, when we were sitting and crying, joking through our tears that if you had left me for Ben I would be mad. Because I wasn't mad, because I trusted you. When you laughed too, I wonder what you were thinking. I wonder if you knew what you were going to do. Were you laughing with me or at me.\n\nThe thing that keeps kicking me in the ass is I have to still be nice to you. I won't tell my family how you hurt me, because that will only rehash it for me. And I can't get mad at you because you hold the access to the one thing I care about, my dog, and I need to maintain that relationship. And it makes me sick that he is walking her and spending time with her. I hate what both of you have done to me. Even this weekend when I was going to pick her up, the thought of seeing you again made me sick and I had to bow out.\n\nSo congratulations. You didn't technically cheat on me. I believe you. But that doesn't change how shitty what you did to us was."

I know a lot of people who have or have had cancer and it\u2019s always very sad to find out someone I know has been inflicted with this horrible disease.\n\nHowever, this is the first time I\u2019ve ever been added to a fb group solely for the purpose of updating everyone they know about the status of the cancer. The family posts constantly on the page and it just really annoys me that they are basically forcing everyone to be constantly concerned for the dad. I mean I get that they are Christians and they want their dad prayed for, etc. I get what a hard time they are going through because I took care of my (then) mil while she fought and lost her battle with lung cancer. But we didn\u2019t force our feelings on everyone and didn\u2019t make sure everyone was in the loop on every detail. We updated those who had specifically asked to be updated. \n\nSo, recently this man had surgery and guess what? Dude is cancer-free!  That\u2019s great and I was pleased to read it. But I would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t a little bit hopeful that the updates would slow down or even stop. Not so. Not only do they still post almost daily, but I just saw a message that said, \u201cto celebrate dad kicking cancer, he wants to take the whole entire family (which includes three children with spouses and a total of 6 grandchildren) to Disney World. If you would like to contribute to our celebration you can donate at this link.\u201d  \n\nMaybe I\u2019m too cynical or a complete jerk, but I just feel like these people are the complete opposite of humble, which my understanding is that Christians are supposed to be humble. \n\nIs this what Facebook is really for?

            "value": "You're not truly transgender- and here's why.\n\nYou gave us a comprehensive list of \"expectations\" that you had for going transgender. It makes me sick saying transgender like it's a verb. Like people haven't killed themselves over bigotry in the past. Like parents were never forced to hide who they really were since they were supposed to be a certain way. You realize that Trans folk aren't the way they are for attention, right? They \"went\" transgender so they could finally feel comfortable in their own skin. They went through a long, bitter, process, which didn't come easy. A lot of these people didn't have access to binders or horomones. They certainly weren't posting TOPLESS PHOTOS OF THEMSELVES IN A BINDER/BRA ON INSTAGRAM FOR EVERYONE TO SEE WITHOUT FEAR THAT THEY MIGHT BE INSULTED, EITHER. Then you have some moody, middle-class, teen who doesn't feel unique enough, and \"going\" transgender because she doesn't like being a girl.\n\nBeing trans also gives her the perk of technically being \"gay\" since she likes boys, but now IS a boy. But when things aren't the glorified gay paradise you thought you'd be launched into, you become a miserable mess and do nothing to change. WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU \"EXPECT\" TO HAPPEN? You have no idea how lucky you are to be a privileged, white, American, living in an age where being queer is praised so much to the point where it's extremely likely that heteros will be hated and homos will be considered normal in the distant future. You self-diagnose and explicitly talk about all the disabilities you have. I remember when Trump was elected, you talked about how fucked you were since you were, to quote: \"a trans autistic queer kid\" and that you \"were in danger.\"\n\nOh.\n\nMy.\n\nFucking.\n\nGod.\n\nYou probably thought that you had us fooled into feeling bad for you, and that we would give you attention. Not me. I guarantee that you felt so fucking good saying those words, that it gave you an orgasm. You are not autistic because you have Asperger's syndrome. I have it too, and I know that it was originally just a disorder like Dyslexia or ADHD- but now since people love to generalize it's lumped together with Autism and the deeper sides of the spectrum. You are not queer since your whole transgender obsession is a fa\u00e7ade and you striving for uniqueness. And you're in \"danger?\" REALLY? What about the working class Mexicans in America? Or the Kansas pipeline? How about NATO? Russians? China?\n\nIt's obvious that you're not any of these things because of how fucking often you bring them up like it's a badge or a status symbol. You may think I don't know what it's like. I have Anxiety, Depression, OCD, AND misophonia. And to top it off, before I self-diagnosed and blurted out that I suffered from these, I talked to my doctor. They've all been diagnosed, Anxiety being the reason I was seeing that doctor in the first place.\n\nYou feel that since gays have been hated historically, you can stick as many titles before your name as you want and nobody can call you out on it or they're trans/homo/whateverphobic. You prove this by how ready you are to be offended and triggered by everything as if the world is out to get you, and you live in an environment where gays are hated. You WANT people to insult/berate you. You always bitch and moan about people mistaking you for a girl, yet you never seem to want to change in your appearance. You have breasts, a high voice, a feminine figure, and you wear feminine clothes. It's likely that you expect people not to apply gender stereotypes and assume your gender, but in the real world, that's not how it works. People still assume. This isn't tumblr- unless you put some real effort into changing yourself, nothing will get better.\n\nYou frequent Tumblr, which is the hotspot of homo glorification. Apparently you and yours on the website strive for \"equality.\" How is homo dominance \"equality?\" Shouldn't equality being nobody shocked at which sex you prefer? Clearly not since being gay is obviously the ideal orientation according to you. You've been lead to believe that being gay is easy- and that if you want to be unique and gay, and want boyfriends and girlfriends, just go trans and everything will be merry! And when they're not, and reality bites you, HARD, you fall on your ass and whine.\n\nYour ignorance is horrendous. In the real world, trans people are considered freaks. Outside of your safe space, people aren't as nice as you think. Nobody cares what your pronouns are, or what you identify as. So when you decide to \"go\" trans, for attention, don't expect life to go smoothly for you. And the fact that you aren't going under the knife, and just lying back and taking all the mockery, clearly means that you declared yourself as transgender just for attention.\n\nYou're not getting it. I don't feel bad for you. No one does. Just admit that you're normal. You aren't unique, and showing that you can easily obtain a title that people have died for, spits in the faces of people who are actually gay. You also can't copout for your shitty behaviour by acting like a timid, frail, triggered, mess all the time. It just makes you pathetic and causes weakness-induced aggression in people.\n\nGet over yourself, you fucking bitch."

My roommate, who, I am ashamed to claim, is also my sister, decided to go out to Northgate tonight, (a bar district beside our university) with her friend and said she might call if she needed a dd. I was like cool I'll just chill and watch old chick flicks. A couple hours later I get a call from her phone but it's her friend telling me where to pick her up at, I go and her friend deposits the rag doll slobbering form resembling my sister into the front seat of the car. I thank the friend then begin to drive home.\n My sister then leans out the window and pukes the whole way home, getting vomit inside the car as well as all over the window and it had this sharp sour smell, like that liquid sour candy from a few years back, so not wholly off putting. Anyways, we get home and as I go around to help her, she tries to clamber out on her own, but is still partially a rag doll and falls against the side of the car into her own vomit. I go to help her and she clamps onto me, getting vomit on me now. Once inside she crawls to the kitchen floor and begins dry heaving, I pour her a glass of water and hand her a trash can and try to assist her to the couch but she declines rudely. So fuck it, I go back to my chick flick watching punctuated roughly every forty five seconds by her dry heaving. Alright, well she has a trash can, no worries, right? Wrong. So dead fucking wrong. About ten minutes later I notice her trying to get out of her little girdle and I'm like, right, yeah, that can't help with the nausea, so I politely look away as I do not wish to see my sisters lady bits. Then I look back about one minute later and she is sitting on the ledge of the oven drawer that is pulled open and I stand up immediately and inquire what the fuck she is doing. She looks up at me with wide innocent eyes and I can tell she is really out of it, she has no clue. \"Are you pooping?!\" I asked her. \"(our brother's name) said it was okay!\" She garbled. Now, our brother, who recently graduated and is now working a big fancy job in Chicago is highly unlikely to have ever told her that it is okay to take a fucking shit in an oven drawer. I then begin yelling and appropriately, I believe, freaking out. She then goes on to claim why would she poop, she doesn't even feel like pooping, at this point the smell is just pungent and I point it out to her but she seems not to notice, I start burning incense and try to convince her to go in her fucking room but she's not having it, I then gather up my things, move them into my room and start burning my incense and candles in here and when I went to fill up my water out of idle curiosity and the slight hope that, maybe she hadn't really pooped, maybe it was paranoia that was making the smell so wretched, I looked behind her into the drawer and sure enough there was a big ol pile of shit all over  all our pans. I gagged and ran back to my room, locked my door and proceeded to type this angry spiel on here in the hopes that someone somewhere will say oh, man, I'm sorry. And did I mention that the entire time I was trying to help her she was being rude and calling me names and being a huge fucking bitch? Because she was. I don't mind helping people, but you better not be an asshole to me when I'm doing you a favor because that really rubs me the wrong fucking way. Goodnight cruel world."

Throughout the course of two year, i was constantly assaulted.\n\nI was used for prostitution.\n\nHe convinced me that there were people watching me on my way to school.\n\nHe claimed there was a video camera embedded in my walls. \n\nI was too insecure to even dress in my own room.\n\nMy mum worked night shifts, and wasnt aware of what was going on. \n\nHe spiked my drink one night. \n\nAnd i passed out, stirring to him on top of me.\n\nI was afraid, scared, petrified... I lashed out at him to get him off.\n\nFinally, he got up and left. \n\nFeeling sick, i went downstairs to get some air.\n\nI fell asleep and he again tried to assault me. \n\nfast forward to two long years later, i had had enough. I was tormented inside, abused. I decided to try and get help.\n\nAround the middle of 2009, i brokedown in my mothers arms, and i told her everything.\n\nShe cried.\n\nShe was distraught. Unstable. \n\nMy mum had mental issues growing up and had begun to turn to drugs for comfort.\n\nOne night she had overdosed and i was left to call the paramedics. She survived.\n\nA year later, after many interviews and a long drifting court case, it was time to go to court.\n\nI remember that day vividly. \n\nTearing up inside, i gave my evidence. \n\nSat in front of a camera, i felt nervous, and throughout the questioning, my reactions were uncontrollable laughing.. i dont know why i laughed.. i didnt do it because it was funny.. i guess it was a defense mechanism for me to deal with the situation in my own way :(\n\nA few days later, the verdict came. \n\nHe was found not guilty.\n\nThat day, he walked out free. \n\nJust as i thought things couldnt get worse, my grandmother passed away from cancer. I brokedown in tears.\n\nI miss her so much :(\n\n5 years later, my life began to twist into a torpedo of emotions, destroying everything which was left in me. \n\nI was placed in a new school, as i decided to move to my dads, and i was considered an outcast. Every day, i would get constantly abused, name calling. I had no friends and was constantly crying over the course of two years. \n\nMy mother met a man online who she claims to have fallen in love with. But he isnt who she thinks he is. He is a compulsive liar and a pedophile, sending me messages saying \"i wont tell her if you wont\" ;) i told her, but she wouldnt believe me.\n\nMy brother who i got in contact with for the first time since he was put up for adoption - is in prison. \n\nI have tried to move on, ive had therapy, help, everything.\n\nAll i feel is anger, hatred, revulsion, sadism. Its like i have two parts of me. \n\nThe other side of me is so loving, i care too much for people and have high expectations, and am constantly leaving myself vulnerable because i dont expect to keep getting hurt constantly. \n\nI am fragile and weak.\n\nI dont want to become the person he became.\n\na MONSTER.\n\nI cant control my emotions, i find it hard to understand myself, but it feels like my emotions are conflicting and chaotic.\n\nI lost the courtcase, nan, mother, brother, friends. Self esteem, confidence. I dont know what to do anymore.\n\nI just hope one day i will find myself again. \n\nBut it's so hard."

He wanted my undying loyalty without telling me what it was about.  I said *\"It depends\"*, he ignored me for 2 hours and then completely lost his shit.  Basically said to me *\"Well, fine then!  I don't want to see you anymore\"*, which reminds me of 4 year olds who storm down the hallway screaming how much they hate their parents at the top of their lungs.\n\nI'm just done.

She has surgery next week, a full laryngectomy. She needs help and can't afford an at home nurse.\n\nSo I decide to be a good son. I take extended leave from work. I give up my place, and I move into the guest room at my mom's house. I handle her feedings and her medications. I handle her phone calls, her business, her shopping, her cleaning, and trying to keep her spirits up.\n\nI tolerate all the things that come with her illness. I tolerate having to get up twice a night to administer her medications. I tolerate my lack of freedom and the fact I can't go anywhere for five minutes without getting a text asking where I am. \n\nBut one thing I can no longer tolerate is the way she treats people. Primarily, she looks for any opportunity to be shitty to people. If someone, anyone, shows her the least little bit of lip, she'll jumo right down their throats, but she gives people nothing but lip.\n\nWe've been doing a lot of calling around to get her affairs in order for the surgery. We frequently get put on hold, disconnected, transferred, and general incompetence. If you've ever tried getting a replacement health insurance card on short notice you'll know what I'm talking about. However, these things are expected, and you gotta roll with it and just try to get through it. Specifically, and I can't stress this enough,  **getting angry solves nothing. Nothing!**\n\nMy mother has yet to realize this. The rep says something can't be done? Immediate freak out. The rep says that information is not available? Immediate freak out. The rep asks you to repeat yourself or says they're having trouble hearing you? Complete freak out.\n\nShe tells people that they're \"fucking stupid,\" tells them she's going to \"hunt them down,\" and that they \"need to be fired.\"\n\nThen she says she has throat cancer as if that's supposed to open up the secret golden door at the end of the hall where all the best services and products are hidden. \"Those peasants get the usual, but you! You have cancer, you special person, you! Come get our ultra special services for no extra charge! With cancer, anything is possible. Even magic!\"\n\nThen she gets even more upset when none of that happens. Bitch, you're not shitting gold! You have cancer! You're not special, you're sick.\n\nShe claims that no one cares even though there are many people busting their asses, myself included, to make sure she's being looked after.  The people that are mean to her are acting that way for a reason. Rather than asking herself why people are shitty to her, she instead says that they don't care that she's sick. What the fuck, man?!\n\nShe often puts me on the phone to be her voice and gets upset that I won't be shitty to people. This is normally after she has already spent 15 minutes on the phone being an ass to whoever she wants me to talk to. Too late, bitch! They're not going to go out of their way to help you now. As I've stated to her many times over the last week, I've worked in a call center, and I refuse to treat these people the way I was treated. They're glorified answering machines, not managers. Furthermore, I wouldn't go above and beyond for an ass and neither will they.\n\nLastly, cancer sucks, but so does a sickness. I'm wouldn't expect someone to treat me special if I had cancer, and I won't treat others like they are special. People with cancer don't deserve special treatment. They don't deserve smiles and laughter and kid gloves. They deserve nothing more or less that what everyone else deserves: opportunity. That's it. \n\nShe loses her ability to speak after her surgery next week. I'm getting the idea that this is a good thing for everyone."

Then one of the guys proceeds to tell me to die because I didn't get a four man EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE WAS SO SPREAD OUT like did he even know how Rez worked??? I had a bad day in comp today because of them and they had the toxicity level to tell me to die over a freaking video game. Sometimes I wonder why I bother with comp.\n\nTLDR: I didn't get an impossible four man Rez and our dps who sucked for the last three comp games told me to kill myself."

We've been going for over a year now and I've never been late and never missed a class.\n\nSo the class I'm currently doing (off leash control) starts at 8am on fucking Saturday morning. WHO DOES THAT?! I am not a morning person. I hate mornings. I hate getting up for work. I work all goddamned week and then I have to get up for class too.\n\nSo anyway, last night I didn't sleep too well (TIL it starts getting light at 4.30am, WTF). I needed to be in the car by 7.20am. \n\n6.30: pushed alarm back to 7am cause I'm a fucking master of getting ready in no time.\n7am: snoozed cause I hate the world\n7.10am: Got up, rampaged around the house getting ready\n7.20am: In car, we're good to fucking go. Fuel light is on. Car is not going to make the 35 minute drive. FUCK.\n\nI lose track of times here for a while.\n\nNo fucking fuel stations on my side of the road between my house and the highway. Every single goddamned light goes red EVEN WHEN NO ONE WAS WAITING AND I'M ON THE MAIN ROAD. End up staying on local roads for ages.\n\nEventually find a fuel station, kind of a fuck around, fill up, blast out of there. Get on the highway. NOTICE THAT IT'S 7.50AM WTF.\n\nNow I'm not proud of this. But I sped. And tailgated. The entire way. So much speeding was done. 140km/h in a 100 zone. I mean...it's not really impressive. But I never speed so it was pretty out there for me. Also automatic loss of license speed if caught.\n\n7.59am: Some guy was making the turn very very slowly in front of me. Scream a lot. Finally pull in.\n\n8am: See someone run in a second before me. They get to go into their class. Sweet, I should be fine then.\n\nNOPE. My teachers class had been going for all of 20 seconds and I wasn't allowed in because I would disrupt it.\n\nSwore. Called my dog an idiot because I didn't have time to put her head collar on and she was lunging around like a spaz. Dragged her away fuming. Could feel the judging eyes of the assistant as I stomped off. She was probably thinking I was a dog abuser. \n\nApologised to my dog back in the car before screaming my fucking head off. Then I drove really erratically and dangerously home. It's now 9.14am and I'm going to go back to sleep BUT I'M SO ANGRY!\n\nThe worst thing about it is that I would probably have easily made it if I got up on 7am alarm and left slightly earlier. So I can only really blame myself. I hate that shit."

I've never done it, but it's a totally normal thing to want after a fight with your parents, right? And everyone thinks about suicide sometimes, when the fights get particularly bad and someone threatens to call 911. Right? That's normal, right?"

We love to travel and are trying to do more and more of it but I am hesitant. She has this huge problem where she has to get those shitty fucking meaningless touristy things for her family and friends. This time she went over bored and bought $300 worth of crap that says the name of the country on it. Stuff that means nothing and will probably just get thrown away by people who \"appreciate\" the gesture but really don't care about it. Fuck that, that is so much money to literally throw away.\n\nIt gets better though. We found out later that it is to much to carry with us (go fucking figure) so now we need to ship it home. Shipping over 8lbs internationally is fucking exsepnsive. So there goes another $400 just to ship that pointless shit back home. She has spent $700 to send people useless junk.\n\nWe are by no means wealthy and could have used that money to stay on vacation for another week, but no making sure people who don't give a shit get their worthless crap is soooo much better than traveling longer.\n\nIts fucking ridiculous and I am pissed off beyond belief. No matter what I say she won't budge on the subject. I have even had some of her friends and family say to her that they hate getting it because it clogs up their house. Did that phase her? No. \n\nI love this girl and she is overall a great person, but this one huge flaw has pissed me off beyond belief. Agdgdgsfsgh. I hate this."

People's taste will be wildly different from person to person. But I've got to ask, is anyone else noticing a huge dip in quality movies/tv shows on their platform? Like, it seems like Netflix is taking off a ton of great shows and movies in lieu of C to D rated crap. Want examples? Well, the original seasons of Futurama are gone, most movies directed by Stanley Kubrick are gone, same for Tarantino films, as well as a ton of miscellaneous films from other great directors. What's been added recently? A ton of Bollywood films (if that's your thing then cool, but not really my taste), a ton of D horror films, some terrible Netflix originals, and really dumb shows like \"Real Stories of the ER.\" I'm not saying that there isn't anything interesting left on Netflix, but I am saying that it seems to me that the platform is being overrun by a lot of shit, and it's as if Netflix isn't too concerned about the quality of the movies and TV shows they add. It was a sad night when I went to go watch a favorite of mine 2001: A Space Odyssey, only to find that it'd been taken off. Maybe it's a regional thing? I've been wondering if maybe certain parts of the country had different listings than others. I doubt that to be true, but it's just a thought. Anyways, me and my friends are pretty pissed off about it. So... yeah"

I hated how you always tried to keep me from my other friends, how you constantly tried to get me to hang out, even when I was clear that I couldn't or didn't want to. Every interaction I had with you was based off of you guilting me into continuing our friendship. You were the neediest person ever. I can't believe you invited yourself over to M's house EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL FOR HOURS JUST BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE PEOPLE ON YOUR BUS. M and I used to have fun on the bus rides home, but then your needy ass came in every goddamn day demanding so much attention that we literally had to set up a schedule for who would talk to you on which days like we were your goddamn babysitters. Those bus rides were long, and we were already exhausted from school and having to be with you prior. I can't believe M and I literally had to run to the bus if we wanted to sit in the same seat on the bus ever. I can't believe you invited yourself over to M's house without even telling her until you were there. Do you realize how horrible and drained I felt just being around you? I was embarrassed to be your friend. You were a b**** to your poor parents, who were two very lovely people I would like to talk to again when you aren't around.\nI don't regret anything I said about you behind your back. I meant every word of it. I feel like I could handle being friends with anyone after spending three years hanging out with you. I get that I said some mean shit, but you still had no right to cuss me out the way you did when you found out. You know why? Because you were a manipulative, conniving, controlling b**** to me and all my friends for years before then, and you only found out because you literally took M's phone and went through our PRIVATE TEXTS while locked in her bathroom while you were bumming around at her house after school just like you did every day after school. Then you did it again later to see what we were saying. Then you had the nerve to try and rebuild our sham of a friendship. You might've apologized, but I'm 100% certain you were never sorry you gave me a goddamn panic attack when you cussed me out the first time, and I'm glad I broke then instead of later because I got rid of your b**** ass way before M did. Those last few months of middle school were great. The car ride to school was uncomfortable (you never should have invited yourself in though, so that's on you), but everything else was great. I loved not having to worry about being your babysitter and entertainer all day. I'm glad I dropped you, especially after your high school fiasco.\n\nI'm still in shock that you and O, your new asshole high school friend, could be so inconsiderate and rude that you actually threw food at kids from other tables. It's your fault that one girl got so mad she came over and punched W (who is great and kind in every way and never deserved it). I'm glad O got caught with weed and got kicked out, I never want to see his horrible face again. Last I heard he brags about persuading uncomfortable girls into having sex with him, which I'm pretty sure is just a fancy way to describe rape. I'm proud of myself for being a stone cold b**** to you when you tried to weasel your way back into my life. I'm glad you dropped out after tenth grade because now I never have to see you again for as long as I live, although I feel very sorry for your parents now that you're their problem 24/7. Is it true that you don't even do schooling anymore and your mom just drives you around to look for acting roles to audition for? Because if so, best of luck, I guess. You'll definitely need it with that shitty personality of yours.\n\nAlso, you were definitely an accident. There's a reason your sister's a decade older than you and your parents are in their sixties."

There are white racist assholes, black racist assholes, muslim racist assholes, and so on. There is no generalizing, except for saying that anyone this misinformed needs to get the FUCK OFF TUMBLR AND RIGHT INTO THE REAL WORLD, LIKE HER. I also think it's worth mentioning two things: something she said and systemic racism. 1) she said that if she didn't want him to be white, that was okey-dokey, but if I didn't want him to be Mexican (which I actually didn't care) IT WAS RACIST AS FUCK.\n\nHmm.

IT'S A REAL ACTUAL PROBLEM AND THERE IS STILL DISCRIMINATION TOWARDS MINORITIES IN THE COURTS AND STREETS. IT IS REAL AND IT HAPPENS. However, you people don't know dick about shit. While real efforts are made to stop these issues and actually do something useful, you people sit on your asses with your iPhones or computer tablets and take a nice bite or the bountiful food you will never run out of. You then pretend to be TRIGGERED after hearing something about racism and then proceed to either get offended on a minority's behalf and tell off and grace the racist individual with your knowledge (UNLESS said racist is a minority then it's technically not racism cuz they're not white AMIRIIITE?!) OR, you will blow things WAY out of proportion in the fake story you will put on your blog for the sake of making you seem like a good and progressive person. Let me lay down some truth to you right here. YOU ARE NOT FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT. YOU ARE NOT SMART. RACISM AGAINST WHITES IS STILL RACISM. Holding a grudge against an ENTIRE RACE FOR A REALLY BAD REASON (this applies to ALL races) AND SOMETIMES NOT EVEN REALLY KNOWING WHY just FURTHER PROVES HOW MISINFORMED ALL YOU ASSHOLES ARE. You see 1 dumb racist asshole on tumblr and you become a dumb racist asshole and so on. I can't believe how much I've been needing to restate this fact. YOU PEOPLE AREN'T FUCKING SAVIOURS, OKAY? YOU'RE ALL JUST FUCKING RACIST! \n\nAnd to those who I just triggered, I am speaking to those on tumblr as a whole website who spread this horseshit, not those of you who are sane. And I have made that ABUNDANTLY CLEAR, partly because despite tumblr being a fucking website with a MASSIVE USER BASE AND y'know, not an actual race of people. So back to those who think whites can't be prejudiced. You wanna know something? I'm white, and have been left to ponder whether or not I should be ashamed of the color of my skin. I guarantee you I'm not the only one who has done so. In history, no less. People who inflict that feeling on others should actually fucking kill themselves, or just take the time to get their facts straight and not be racist. So what I'm trying to say, essentially, is that you have the same mentality as those who were opposing black rights all those years ago. Both of you: cling onto the past, overgeneralize a LOT and constantly use blanket statements, assign blame, cause fear, and suggest that one race is better than the other. But the worst part? This time, you're too blinded by your arrogance and showered with compliments and labels of \"equality\" and \"this girl's fightin' the good fight\" to realize you're nothing more than another brick in the wall of racism. So me, all my muslim, asian, black, and hispanic friends, and basically every other educated person on the planet IMPLORE YOU: Stop parroting bullshit and let the sane people handle these issues.\n\n\nAnd just for the record I am not interested in anybody telling me what an asshole I am, or how I'm wrong. Spare yourself the trouble.\n\n"

            "value": "This is a rant that will require some context first.\n\nSo I began my second year of university, living in a house with my high-school friend who we will call Kyle. After having lived in residence, we decided this year we'll rent rooms in the same house together. See though, Kyle isn't the most financially comfortable person out there, so I had to settle for a house with 9 other house mates, that is old, unkept, relatively far from campus, and overall disgusting. Carpet has huge black stains, who knows what that was. Shower floor is black with age and dirt. Of course though, I was fine with it at the time, because it was all so I could live with my best friend Kyle. \n\nNow over the summer, between first and second year, Kyle basically didn't speak to me, which was a huge red flag. Responded maybe twice on facebook, never initiated conversation himself. We saw each other one time, and that was at a party we didn't expect to see each other. I saw university friends living 5 hours away more often than I saw Kyle, who lived twenty minutes away at most. At this point I was already pretty weary and unhappy with Kyle. Wtf kind of friend just ignores you with no preceding conflict.\n\nWell now schools back, and I've been sharing a house with this dude for 3 weeks now. In no way did Kyle seem resentful towards me or upset. That's when I realized, this dudes just an ignorant self-absorbed secluded asshole. My experience within those 3 weeks further proves this, seeing as he has so far denied 90% of any proposition to hang out. I invite him to a party? \"Nah I'm staying in tonight.\" I invite him to go to a store 2 bus stops away? \"Nah it's windy as hell outside.\" I invite him to hang out in my room? \"Sure man I'll be there in a few minutes.\" Never comes. The only time we see eachother is when he needs to do errands, and I'm conveniently around to keep him company for that short time. Otherwise, this guy basically sits in his room all day, and as of yet has made no attempt to actively be my friend or to even have a social life with other people. \n\nSo here I am, living in a disgusting house of ten people, 20 minute walks away from my other friends, bored out of my mind, because the one person I thought would keep me company is too ignorantly intent on not giving a crap about this friendship to even care. I could have lived in a beautiful 4 room house, hardwood floors, clean shower, quiet, 1 minute from campus, close to my friends. Sure I would have been alone, but I'd be just as fucking alone as I am here at the moment with this piece of fucking garbage Kyle! I am overall very upset with my situation right now, Kyle 100% fucked me over because he honestly forgot to care about this friendship. I am certain I did nothing wrong to upset this guy. I honestly believe he either thinks he's too cool for me (he has no other friends besides me so wtf?) , or that he is just too self absorbed to think about anyone besides himself. I was the good friend, sticking with Kyle even when I was forced to live in a crappy place, I considered  the dude my brother, and now he rarely speaks to me.\n\nFuck. You. Kyle. "

LET'S JUST LET THOSE FUCKING DANGEROUS GANGSTERS DIE, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT BLACKS WHO SPEAK EBONICS DROP 200 IQ POINTS SO THEY CAN'T EVEN HOLD JOBS AND DAMN! THOSE FAT BLACK HOS COULD NEVER GET OFF THEIR FAT ASSES TO WORK. THEY BETTER SPEAK REAL ENGLISH WITH A PHD IN MATHAPHYSICALCOMPUTERBIOGINEERING AND WORK 40 HOURS A DAY WITH NEGATIVE TWO KIDS (Because if you have kids and are poor you deserve it fuck those kids) OR ELSE THEY DON'T DESERVE GOVERNMENT MONEY. Oh pale freckled blond haired blue eyed sam is from africa and he got an african american scholarship intended for blacks because fuck the meaning behind it plus the fact that there are plenty of other scholarships you can apply for and you don't need those few for blacks because you aren't black.

IT'S NOT FAIR THIS IS RACISM!!)  AND THAT A MALE CAN'T GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT BEING SCRUTINIZED (omg why wont people stop judging me for looking like a homeless man!!! But if bitches be trippin cuz her breasts are fairly big and wearing sexy clothes fuck her she was asking for it)      \n\nIn short, FUCK YOU. IT ALWAYS HAS TO BE ABOUT WHITE PEOPLE (mostly us guys because those damn females are just so emotional and crazy riiiiite?) EVERYONE ELSE LUBE UP BECAUSE FUCK YOU SIGNED FUCKER FUCKITY FUCKING FUCK FUCKS.\n\nI don't hate reddit. I get that there are different groups of people with conflicting opinions and that the site has no one say over anything. There's lots of great stuff on here, but all the scattered (and blared) racism, mysogony and general minority hating over time pushed me over the edge.

His face makes me sick. \n\nMy ex was not only abusive but also the most pathetic, insecure, horrible little man. Bit of background, my fiancee left me in December 2016 and I'm heartbroken and on a 2 month bender. I meet this guy in February 2017 through my now ex best friend and her boyfriend. I was incredibly vulnerable at that point as well as fucked up 24/7 and got carried along. \n\nAnyway - he is the most sad excuse for a person I've ever encountered for many reasons, some legitimate and some petty.  \n\nHe is pseudo smart. He regurgitates the same stupid facts constantly to make everyone think he's worldly and intelligent but he's actually the dumbest person I've ever met and it's so infuriating. \n\nHe never took his clothes off during sex. And I'm talking SHOES, socks, jeans (have you ever felt a fucking zip on your clit???) T shirt sometimes A JACKET, a fucking SNAPBACK yet forced me to take my shirt off when I didn't want to, and my socks even though my feet were cold - yeah socks during sex seems a little weird but when you're riding the dick of some lazy loser who is fully clothed,  who'll never get on top, it's a little bit more normal.\n\nHe wouldn't let me touch his hair and even if it was an accident, he'd go crazy. He owned two hairdryers and went through a bottle of hairspray a week to the point his hair was completely stuck together and had the consistency of a potato chip. \n\nI'm usually a devout Christian but sometimes go through some really hard phases where I struggle a lot, use, get violent, depressed, promiscuous - Bipolar related - he told me after I went to church (screamed at me) that my God wasn't real, it was all bullshit, that I'm stupid and none of it ever happened.\n\nHe took me to the houses of really violent, and kinda creepy dealers. \n\nHe never came to my place, I constantly had to get a ride to his place, he came to my place ONCE in 4 months and it was only because I dumped him for being a complete ass. \n\nHe got me extremely drunk and fucked up knowing I'm an awful drunk, even worse when I'm on a cocktail of different substances, then kicked me out of his friend's car in the dark to walk a mile home while staggering and so wasted I couldn't even text because I accidentally burnt the ceiling with a cigarette (not exactly my fault if I was allowed to smoke in the car and his friend was driving like an idiot and on MDMA, how was I supposed to stop hitting the ceiling when the car was being driven that violently? \n\nHe thought it was ok to let me in the car of a guy smoking a joint while he was driving and the guy was intentionally exhaling the smoke so it would go right in my face while I was sitting behind him even though I told him I didn't want to get high. \n\nI asked him to roll me a really shitty spliff with hardly any weed in. He knows I'm an awful stoner, I get incapacitated so quick. He rolled it with a shit ton of fucking keef in it. If you know, you know. I was GONE, I was so fucking freaked.\n\nHe acted like he was some sort of father figure to his sisters (he goes to his Mother's once a week, ONCE, and puts some fish fingers in the oven for them) and used it to guilt me when I pulled out of some plans because I didn't feel too good. \n\nMade me cry on the phone simply because I was worried about him being out with friends and fucked up and he hadn't got into contact for hours, I texted his friend to ask and suddenly I'm being bombarded of calls accusing me of trying to cheat on him and screaming at me to never speak to other men without telling him again. \n\nHe bit right up to my collarbone super hard because I wore 'low cut tops' at college and he didn't want other men looking at me. My shirts aren't very low cut for someone with B cups. I don't even wear push up bras. \n\nHe made me delete all my platonic male friends off Facebook (2 boys in my college classes who definitely weren't boyfriend material and were basically little boys) and my best male friend from school - if he'd listened to me, he'd know that my best male friend from school was the first person to be nice to me when I moved there and we'd been friends for 7 years and he'd never ever tried anything because we were totally platonic. He'd helped me through the hardest times and I was so fucking offended. \n\nHe constantly accused me of talking to my ex fiancee, so much so that I had to actually talk to my ex fiancee who WAS IN ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP to tell him to block my boyfriend. \n\nHe asked me how I got so good at blowjobs. So I told him that I'd given a lot. Starts screaming at me and won't speak to me for hours. We'd openly discussed his sexual history, including telling me about taking the virginity of a girl we see almost daily which really upset me. And he asked the question. So why cry at the answer?\n\nWhenever I looked nicer than usual and made an effort, he was CONSTANTLY convinced it was for some other guy. \n\nTold me my mental illness was bullshit and all in my head and that it can be controlled by my diet. I have severe Bipolar disorder and a long family history of it, so much so that it showed itself while I was extremely young and I was diagnosed very young too (in the UK, that's pretty fucking rare that a 13 year old gets diagnosed with ANYTHING by the NHS mental health services) \n\nHe couldn't do anything without weed and cried and raged constantly, wouldn't go out or even touch me. So I ended up buying his weed and he never paid me back, ever.\n\nEnrolled in my college for September last year because he wanted to keep an eye on me (we'd been broken up months) so I didn't go back. I'm now NEET, again. \n\nHe randomly messaged me in October, ignored him for a while and it turned out he was trying to get a reaction out of me, and did so he could put it on his Snapchat story and screenshotted it to show to his new college friends, and told everyone it was because of my mental illness and that I was a 'nutter'.\n\nI cried over the London terror attack and somehow that equated to me being 'racist' so he begins to go completely crazy then starts punching things and leaves to go and take out his anger or he'd 'fuck' me 'up'. \n\nI needed plan B and I got upset and was crying, he left the room instead of comforting me. I had to phone a friend then my Dad. My dad had to take me to get Plan B, then the next day it made me feel horrible and I texted him, he didn't reply. He was out getting fucked up while I was suffering with this stupid pill.\n\nHe wanted to get me pregnant. \n\nPerformed certain sex acts on me without permission, I was too timid to outright say no, so I was kinda jokingly saying stop, closing my legs etc etc. Didn't work.\n\nHeadbutted me (a 5'6, 120lb girl, he's 6'2 and way bulkier than me) in front of his best friend and my ex best friend and her boyfriend, when they left late at night he completely let loose on me knowing I couldn't go home (was really off my head and couldn't let my grandparents see me like that) because I give out cigarettes when I'm drunk and I apparently gave more to his best friend than him (I was fucking drunk, on the ground, with no top on. Does he really think I'd know who I was giving cigarettes to?). Later that night he proceeded to rape me while I was too fucked up to even muster the strength to tell him to fuck off. Assuming it was to get some control back. \n\nHe got mad at ME for a man hitting on me in a bar. \n\nBerated my father even though he has never met him nor had any contact with him. He also refused to meet my parents or stepparents or brother. \n\nBest part of it? My so called friends, after seeing chunks of all this going on, didn't say shit and are still friends with him to this day, even though he threatened to go to their houses to kill my ex best friend and her boyfriend."

Time is getting short so I've started looking for apartments. Given that I have ten GODDAMN days left to find a place, even an apartment can be iffy. \n\n First of all, the idea of me living in a small ass apartment with my mother is a pretty shitty situation. Honestly, I would like to avoid that, but whatever, I'm going to do what I have to.\n\n And this gets to the point that is really pissing me off. Time is short, I'm not 100% sure I can find a place in time. Ok, so I need a contingency plan because it's just a good idea. So, I start planing. I figure my mother could stay with my sister as she has some extra room.\n\n So at this point I talk to my sister and explain the situation, telling here that I'm running out of time and need a backup in case I'm unable to find a place in time.\n\n Turns out this was a mistake... Despite the fact that she has a spare room she starts crying that she doesn't have the room and she can't take our mother in even for a week. And to make matters worse, she starts suggesting I get a short term apartment.\n\n Did you just listen to a goddamn fucking thing I just said you stupid goddamn bitch? So after an argument, I get pissed off and tell her to fucking forget it.\n\n So I've gotten into an argument with my sister and I'm pissed off. But I still need a plan and since it involves my mother I decide to talk to her.\n\n That was my second mistake...\n\n So she goes off on some bullshit about me being defeated before I even started. What the fuck? Did you not fucking hear a goddamn word I just fucking said you fucking bitch?\n\n Then it gets worse, she goes on to tell me how I need to get an apartment and all this bullshit I'm already doing.\n\n I know my mother is dumb as a rock, but fuck me. I don't believe this shit, nobody is listening to me and apparently I'm not allowed to have a fucking backup plan. I've got to believe God will find me a house at the last minute.\n\n And to make matters worse, I took my mother in when she didn't have a place to stay. I've help my sister out many times in the past and I've never asked for anything in return.\n\n And what the fuck do I get for trying to be a good brother and son all this time? The one time I ask for fucking goddamn help all I get is bitching and moaning and fucking people telling me what I should do.\n\n But apparently I'm the asshole because I got pissed off. \n\nSo fuck me, I'm running out of time, I can get no help from my family. I was a fool to think my family would actually be helpful.\n\nEven after a huge argument a few hours ago, my mother has fucking came to ask me about fucking goddamn apartments and to tell me what I should do while I have been writing this post.\n\nFuck me, I'm so fucking pissed off I just want to break something.

His injuries are so severe that they can't medevac him...They had to call a NICU team to make the one and a half hour drive from the nearest pediatric trauma center\n\n\nOf course no one believed that much damage happened in a fall. The father was immediately taken into custody and admitted to shaking him (which is still a lie. Shaking doesn't explain the broken bones).

Lot of Jeresy's Mikes.  \n\nAnyways, new pizza joint opened recently in the area, and we talked about ordering from there, they had a lot of good sounding specialty pies.  So we all agreed to order a couple of the pies, and split them, kind of like a tasting almost, figure out what was good.  There were wings too, and subs, we got a bit of everything.  I knew this was going to be an expensive luncheon, and in the name of good pizza and wings I'm willing to do just about anything.\n\nFood arrives at about 2PM, and here I am, stuck on a chat with a customer.  They set up everything on a table on our call floor, being the weekend most of the other teams aren't there so we have space.  We had divided this up among five people, including two large subs, three large pizzas, and about fifty wings (since we wanted to try a couple of the different flavors).  Helping a sweet old woman with her iPhone, had to do a lot of work, I don't get off that chat till 3:30PM.  I grab some food, a couple of wings, a few pieces of the now cold pizza.  Pretty good, but I don't have a lunch till much later in the day, so I have to get back to work.  \n\nWhile I'm working, the three other people involved in this decide to take the rest of the food, leave work early, and have one of their many Sunday night drinking parties.  Not that I'd ever get invited to those.  They also took all the food with them.  I ended up paying $28 dollars for about 11 chicken wings and roughly 1/8th of a pizza.  I hate them.  So much right now.\n\nJoey Tribbiani was right.  Don't share fucking food."

It did not go well, not with plain water, not with plain soap and water, nor with dishwashing detergent. It simply wanted to mat together, in a bad mess. We seemed to be making things worse. But, our main concern was to try to wash off any remaining insecticide in the fur. \n\nSo we gave it just enough limited washing with soap and a soft wet rag and some drying with a soft cloth, and since the creature did not seem to be in pain, no broken skin, no signs of poisoning, we secured it in a recovery area and hoped that nature would take its course, planning to shear the areas if need be the next morning.\n \nNature did take its course. By this morning, most of the [material] was gone (probably from licking), and kitty seemed fine.\n\nTo whoever leaves dangerous pesticides laying about instead of properly disposing of them, FUCK YOU.

When your married, all the other person does is drives you nuts with expectations that seem normal but are never up to fucking standard to the point you want the fuckers who fed you all that hype in your single years, private parts included, to fuck off and disappear off the face of the earth, forever.\n\nI'm writing this, on Valentine's day, sitting in my car, coming to grips with the fact that no matter how, what, where, or why one plans something not of their forte, it's doomed to fail....As I do every fucking year since I got in this relationship 8 years ago.  Every year, it does not hurt less.\n\nThe flowers are always dead, late, cancelled, or not available.  The dinner plans are always NOT what she wants to do.  The gifts are always things she was \"joking\" about wanting, regardless of how nice, expensive, elegant, or fill in some other thing that makes it not a joke to the other party.  So you make multiple plans and tell her, they all fail.  You make plans and don't tell her, she does not understand and thinks you planned nothing.  You sacrifice time on the job when you should be working to fail over and over and over.  You tell her you're not doing anything in a fight the day beforehand because of her shitty manipulative behavior, she's mad when you're a man of your word.\n\nYou can't win....Then you look back and you don't miss the days when you were single either.  Sitting in your apartment, horny, tired from a hard day's work, wanting at least someone to talk to but you have nobody.  You jerk off trying to remember what the last time you had sex was like only to realize it sucked for both of you because neither of you would be touched by a forty foot pole by the opposite sex if they knew what darkness lies beyond your exterior, and you lack in experience because the entire dating thing is so fucked and business like anyway.\n\nAnd that's key, business. Marriage is not a part of love, or your beliefs, it's a binding contract for business, tax, and commercial purposes.  Love is just a woman's business of finding a man to support her freely who is rich (good luck unless you're a size 2 model), handsome (pick one or the other, you can't have both), has all of his shit together (does anyone ever get their shit together and actually fucking KEEP it together!?!?), Is nice, but not a pushover, can take charge without being an asshole (pretty much everyone is),but can shut up and let her do whatever she wants, sensible or not!  To men, it's a pledge of love that becomes a legal binding business document to lose regardless of how right or wrong anyone is. \n\nBut the suit and tie motherfuckers who run this fucking ball of dirt WANT it this way.  Because it makes, and keeps them rich.  That grand and mighty magical ball of wanton sex and dishonest friendship we call love, keep em chasing after it like a horse with a carrot dangling before his face, so it notices not the big swindle going on in the background.\n\nIf you work for big business, kill yourself. Marketing, kill yourself. Focus groups, kill yourself. Florists, go stick those roses up your candy ass.  Candies, go binge your own diabetic poison. Friends of the wife, go play in traffic, singles who think it's better, it's not, married fucks, your a bunch of manipulative, yellow, smug, fake, plastic, shitheads.  If you wear a suit to work or work for a card company, fuck off. \n\nLove is dead, and y'all killed it! I hope your fucking happy, is that money sucking your dick right now?  Is that golden ring licking your cunt better than that virgin who tricked you in high school?  How bout Dem divorce papers! I hate humanity all year around, but nothing is growing more angry, spiteful, and willing to retaliate than happy fucking VD day. And if your single, might as well do that because the last miserable man trap at the bar will probably gift you something you don't want.\n\nYour supposed to love this person till you die, 365/12/24/7.  Not for one retarded day that make some grandma who named her candy company after what she desires so much because of an ocular issue.  Not for one retarded day where a company shockingly close in name to \"skidmark\" gets an annual bonus because you put one in your pants when you saw the bill for some shitty ceramic cherub or worse yet, some fucking piece of cardboard covered in sappy shit.  Not because everyone a fucking round you enjoys acting as another idiotic spokesman for another shitty corporation somewhere worldwide.\n\nFuck Valentine's day.  I hope hallmark becomes a fire hazard, cupid gets butt raped, and that I can have a chance in hell to skewer these emotionally chilly, materialistic fucktards in hell."

She will eat meat so long as someone else paid for it, which seems like a terrible excuse for a loophole.\n\nEvery restaurant choice for a birthday or special event is entirely contingent upon her ability to tout her vegetarianism. For instance, my wife's family was planning to go out to eat for her father's birthday. I proposed we check out a new barbecue spot, since I know my wife's dad love it and everyone eats meat... including my sister-in-law. Not only was my delicious idea shot down, but I was regarded as being rude and careless about my sister-in-law and her family's \"vegetarianism.\" We wound up going to a second rate noodle house and lo-and-behold: the vegetarian is enjoying a heaping plate of spring rolls, riddled with shrimp.\n\nIt's really hard to hear someone say, constantly, that they're vegetarian, but then have to watch them nosh on turkey at Thanksgiving.

I hope he is tucked up under your trunk. Because I cannot even fathom the horror that would happen if we missed him when we looked under the hood. Honestly. My fiance was crawling under your car squeezing as far under as he could, to save this animal.\n\n But you were just too busy kissing that nasty looking guy against his green nissan.

My Wife and I take him to the Vet who gives us the option of giving him medication that could potentially keep the degradation from progressing(but not make him better), or euthanize him.  He doesn't even have the energy to lick peanut butter off my finger while he dies in my arms.\n\n* I finally tell my parents that I am Transgender, as I have started HRT, and they disowned me.\n\nSo, that has been the last month, up until today, this afternoon.  I, pretty much, just need a shoulder to cry on.  My Wife and I have been switching off on being that shoulder, and we're exhausted.  So, I post on a friends facebook page(my facebook messenger is fucked up, it keeps telling recipients that I cannot accept messages), saying I'm distressed and asking her if she can hang out.  She deletes it, and sends me the following(censor being my name IRL)\n\n>-----, I need you to not post stuff like that on my facebook pictures and statuses.\nYou make it look like we're going through some sort of breakup and we're not.\nI've already had multiple people ask me who you are and what's going on.\nI know you're going through a lot right now and I really hope it gets better for you.\nEventhough the things *(Other Friend)* and I are going through are completely different from what you're going through it doesn't make it any less difficult for us.\n\n...Yeah.  She is having Jet Lag from her shopping spree in Japan, other friend has work stress.  I get it, that sucks, but...really?  Since I've been driving truck ever since I separated from the Navy, these two are the ONLY two friends I have.  And she's mad because other people are talking to her.

I was working full time as well, but 2 days ago on Thursday I lost my job, after a year and a half of being excellent in it (I got praised by the staff a lot), but they had the position cut off (it was some government office job, which you can't control how many positions there are because it from's up above), and I had to leave (it's equivalent to being fired, I have all my rights dw). \n\nSo now, I gotta get a new job, figure I'll try searching for something in my field (computer science) but I can't seem to find any... and I'm really worried of not having a job and start eating on my savings (which are only like 5 paychecks~).\nI also raise a dog by myself and rent my own place, which is REALLY cheap (I mean, really, it's 50% the market price in my city for this size and area). So right now I will get my last paycheck on 1.10, and I will also get some sort of compensation for being fired for extra 3 months should I not find a job by then...\n\nBut I'm just so pissed I feel like I reached the tipping point and am about to just explode all over the place. My boyfriend's trying to help me calm down and all and just chill, but he's also go his own problems at life and all and he's busy at his family's (family illness).... and I'm so disappointed and pissed off with everything ugh. \n\nI don't have a license yet, I tried getting one but I keep panicking during the tests and I fail the driver's tests, so far failed 4 I think (yea it's been long enough I forgot how many I took...) and I'm really not motivated to do anything regarding that.\n\nAnd this week I found out my laundry machine just kinda got fucked up and won't work properly, and I can't really fix it, plus fixing it will be as pricey as getting a new 2nd hand one from someone around here, so I rather just get a \"new\" one... but I can't really carry one for 2-3 miles by myself, without a car, and when I just asked my parents to help me out with that, something I almost NEVER do (because I know exactly what kind of treatment I'll get) results in \"uh I'll see if I can during the week.. will let you know\" from my dad, which might come off as ungrateful from me, but it really isn't, because I almost never ask for any kind of help and the several times I do I am always the last priority in everything, even after they both (my parents) asked me to take 2, not 1, 2, loans on my name for some big $$$ to help them during a crisis, something I just did without putting them through the whole \"uh ok so I'll do it in like sometime ok\" bullshit I ALWAYS receive. \n\nand I mean for fuck's sake I never ask for stuff, and getting a new machine is, um, lets see, kinda urgent!! And it's the weekend and I could just finish this today before we're caught up in all the new week agenda's and people are busy etcetc. I found a person who's willing to sell me their machine, but I need some lift for it, and since it's the weekend here - there's no professional's service to hire, and I don't have a car like I stated, and just UGH fuck I'm just feeling like every little thing right now just helps me get closer to the edge and feeling of just wanting to die in some ditch without all those worries.\n\nit's not even just about the damn laundry machine really, it's about everything that is resembles to me right now... which is just that I'm stuck in this position right now, being unemployed (thus having time to think too much) and alone (since bf is at parents') and just really frustrated with my life... I hate when stuff's going out of direction or hand and I have to rethink things and try to fix the damn situation with an all hands on deck situation... UGH\n\n\ntl;dr I am really pissed at the world right now and I fucking hate how everything is shitty. "

Her boyfriend - very cool guy, so at least there's that - practically lives with us, and yet nobody has yet to put him on the lease. Every time I try to talk to her about anything that needs planning or doing around the apartment, she gives me an attitude. Just today she had the gall to tell me she DIDN'T have an attitude, when just a couple weeks ago I asked her if she could go ask milk and she told me \"I'm not leaving this apartment.\" Not, \"no, sorry.\" Just \"I'm not leaving this apartment.\" And she says \"how about we clean up after ourselves, K?\" when a week ago she LEFT THE APARTMENT WITH HER DIRTY DISHES ON THE FLOOR with my NOTEBOOK as a COASTER. And THEN she has the gall to tell me she's said things that she has NEVER said. Some may be because I'm hard of hearing, and therefore I don't hear everything she says (a point she always ignores, because FUCK ME, amirite?). However comma, she said my mother told her not to use certain chemicals, and while I've researched that it IS true that pregnant women shouldn't be doing so, MY MOTHER NEVER TOLD HER. SHE'S EITHER LYING OUT HER TEETH OR GOING FUCKING INSANE. And SHE wants to abandon ME because \"I'm always complaining.\" NO. FUCK YOU.

We're fucking leaving already. It's 7. Fine, my fault. I should have been prepared, considering she always goes to places an hour or two early while shouting at me about how we'll be late, like she is doing at the moment. All the while, she's also randomly inserting 'Get my (item) I forgot it in (synonym of somewhere)', forcing me to listen to every sentence else she gets even madder that I'm not getting shit she forgot.\n\nAlright, we're out. Did something to anger me that I've forgotten on the way out. In the car, she says the steering wheel's too cold, and asks me to look for gloves around the backseats, then glares at me when I say there are none. So we're driving to school.\n\nBut suddenly OH YOU HAVE TO GO TO MCDONALDS HERE'S A STACK OF COUPONS I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE YOU LEFT SO YOU COULD PREPARE SOME MONEY BUT NOW WE'RE ON A MOVING CAR BUT FIND THE RIGHT COUPON AND MONEY GL. I try to ask her if we could just not and go directly to school. Hell, the mall McD doesn't even open until 7, and they're incredibly slow for the first hour.\n\nFuck no! I end up having to reach for my backpack in my backseat, searching for money. I'm not usually very nauseous, but someone woke me up with only 6 hours of sleep, in combination with moving car and angry shouting = massive headache. But I find a $20 bill and the right coupon, and think I can nap a bit before we get to McD.\n\nYO HURRY AND ANSWER ME ARE WE GOING TO THE MCDONALDS AT (Insert place) OR THE ONE IN THE MALL'S WALMART? Of course, when I open my eyes, the turn to the former McD is literally 5 seconds away, and by the time my brain processes this, she's at the turn but not in the right lane so she's just stopped there fucking with traffic, so I tell her we're going to the former McDonald's.\n\nOh, but the turn has too much oncoming traffic, so she decides it's taking too long so we're going to the mall McD. She starts yelling at me about how I should have known about the traffic and shouldn't be greedy about wanting to go to McDonald's there. And she says I'm purposely trying to fuck with her. Yes, me, who was trying to sleep the entire time, was fucking with the one who wouldn't shut up.\n\nSo we enter the mall parking lot AND HOLY SHIT TELL ME DO WE TURN LEFT OR RIGHT? We've been to this mall every other day the last 2 years, and I don't remember a first time going there, so I'm going to assume she's been familiar with the mall my entire lifetime, but apparently she doesn't know which end of the mall Walmart's on, despite it being the part of the mall we visit second most, besides the food court, which happens to be the direct opposite end. So I tell her left, only to find I could see Walmart from where we were pretty clearly anyway.\n\nBut she doesn't get to Wal-mart. She goes to the mall entrance about quarter-length of the mall. I ask her why we can't go directly to the Walmart entrance, and she starts yelling at me saying she doesn't know where I want her to go and that I'm driving her insane. Doesn't know where to go? IT'S THE END OF THE FUCKING MALL JUST KEEP DRIVING. I didn't even say that though, as she suddenly starts doing u-turns, literally driving in circles. I tell her to stop the fucking car and I get off, having to walk a lot more than necessary to Walmart, which luckily had just opened. I buy the shit, go back to the car, shit's fine.\n\nExcept the car isn't fucking there anymore. I should remind you it's about 7:20 in the morning according to later angry recap by her. There's 1 fucking car in the entire parking lot and it's not hers. It was the same color and similar shaped too, so I actually walked up to it before I realized it was empty and saw it wasn't the same model. She's not fucking parked and I don't see her on the road where I was dropped off. And she left with my damn backpack too.\n\nI stood their for a while, seething.  I walked around in circles seeing if she'd come back. I waited about 2 minutes before deciding fuck it, and I went back in, and headed to the food court end, which was the side of the mall facing towards the school. It's about a twenty minute walk, and springtime Canada. I didn't even feel it though because of how angry I was. I think; if she didn't mean to leave me their, she would have realized sometime during the 20min walk that I'd probably left for the school. She had my backpack, which she would bring if it was an accident. So I ate my McD in front of the school's main doors, and generally dawdle until 8. Still not sign of her. I decide to go up to the library which opens at this time; she's probably not coming after what I now know is 40min.\n\nBut when my first class starts, my teacher gets a call that my mother is there. God dammit it took you fucking how long? My iPad in the backpack had full volume and sound effects, so I had tried facetiming myself from my iPod to annoy her when I was in the library. I bet she brought it back because it was too fucking annoying or something, and didn't want to leave it in the car.\n\nSo after school I come home, and bitch is mad at *me*, cause I left her in the parking lot. I say I didn't see her there, in an accusing tone, which she seems to miss or is ignoring. She says she doesn't fucking believe that, as she was right in front of the entrance. Really? I walked from the entrance to that single parked car in the parking lot without noticing this other car just plopped in front of the entrance? Even more bullshit. I tell her if she doesn't believe I could miss a car just in front of the door, then she should stop saying she was there because I obviously wouldn't have missed it if she had been.\n\nI also ask her why she then didn't fucking see me come out of a doorway. Was it really that hard to keep track of the people coming in and out of a door you were apparently right beside? I remind you this was when all the small shops in the mall were closed and all the big ones only just opened. I literally only passed 1 person in the mall and 2 people at Walmart/McDonalds when buying my breakfast during the morning. As well, the mall entrance to Walmart was closed, I had to exit and enter from the Walmart entrance, which she claims she saw me do without even my prompting. It was literally impossible for me to have bought the combo and sneaked out another entrance.\n\nShe suddenly changes the topic to how cold her fucking fingers were because she had to wait in the car so long only for me to not come out. She was cold? *She was cold?* She, who was sitting in a damn car with heating? She immediately follows by saying my stunt wasted a lot of gas because she left the engine idle the entire time she waited and actually fell asleep. Oh yea, must have been real cold in a heated car while you were sleeping. Apparently, she waited for 40min in the car before going in and 'searching all over for me'. She really thought I'd still be in the mall after 40min? It takes how long to eat a McD combo? What the hell would I have done after that? Go clothes shopping? There's an EBGames and I could have potentially been in the food court and that's it. And of course, this would be 8, so she should know I would have left for the school whether I did so immediately after buying McD or until the last minute.\n\nAnd once again, the accusation that I did everything on purpose to mess with her. That I fucking walked for 20 minutes in the cold past two major intersections without a jacket when I could barely keep my eyes open when I was still in the car, just to leave her in the frigid setting of a heated car. That I did it to waste away her entire morning, even though she apparently slept through most if not all the time I apparently wasted her, and somehow this 40min nap set her yardwork schedule back by 4 hours. \"I was supposed to be done before 12\" she was finishing up when I first got home. \n\nAnd she's asking me to apologize. To hell with her."

Another aspect of conceptually good shows is the Netflix anime. Do you know what it's like to be interested in one only for the animation style to be the laggy 12 fps bullshit that is only watchable for the most dedicated of fans? Finally, I want to talk about location-selective movies and tv shows. If you look up The Big Bang Theory, or a popular show you might find interesting, it will be available on Netflix DVD rental, but not online. Now if you go to anywhere else in the world (yes anywhere else, in Japan it worked) those shows will most likely be available, probably because DVD rental isn't that big there.

I know the names of all her friends from her hometown, the names of all her ex-boyfriends, and pretty much every intimate detail about her life whereas I don't think she's ever even asked me how I was doing once! She brags about her grades, and random guys she goes out with, and parties she goes to on weekends constantly. I kinda just dealt with this my first few months in college because i was happy and eager to make friends. But I have changed, and she has gotten worse in terms of self-absorption. Any word I can squeeze into the conversation goes through one ear and out the other with her. I feel she doesn't actually listen to what I have to say unless she can somehow recall a story about herself based on the topic. She also always tries to one-up me and its irritating. Even the most obscure things, she will make a story about herself with. For example I was having dinner with her and a few friends the other day and I was talking about how I tutored math over the summer and she obnoxiously interjected and started telling a story about how SHE tutored clarinet for more money. She also gets weird around my other close friends....\nUpdate: When I start talking to someone I recognize, she'll just walk away sourly but yet I have to meet all of her stupid friends from high school that I don't even care about. She also always tries to outsmart me and condescend, as if she's talking to kindergartners. She tries to correct me and tries to prove she's right even when she's wrong. Like once we were talking about damn hover boards and I mentioned how they are illegal in NYC and she tried so hard to prove I was wrong until I showed her\nUpdate 2: on the intenet and she was like \"oh well that's because it's recent so I didn't know about it...\" Probably the most irritating thing about her is that she assumes I am so invested in her life. It's second semester and the only thing I am focused on right now is doing well in my courses especially since I don't live on campus anymore and am not interested in partying/drinking/boys any more. She will call/text me when i'm in the library 2 tell me elaborate stories about a boy she has a crush on\nUpdate 3: every opportunity she gets she tries to rub in my face that some random guy asked her out and how she's seeing a movie with so and so or kissed so and so. when i don't care at all. I am not in college to hear about someone talk about boys 24/7 and it's annoying that she thinks i want to hear it. She will FaceTime me when i am at home trying to relax just to show me that she's getting ready for a party and which bar she's going to etc. She will always ask if I'm going to watch her snapchat story\nUpdate 4: As if my life is so uninteresting I have to watch hers. Even when I say no I'm too busy to watch her snaps she gets offended and whines that whatever she's doing is more interesting than what I'm doing. She also has a habit of sending me screenshots of text conversations she has with guys asking her out and then pretends she sent them by accident, but i know it's just because she wants to brag...\nUpdate 5: She always talks about her looks and even feels the need to discuss her cup size and how her hair is so nice. She always sends snapchats of her outfits to me expecting compliments in return but when I got my hair blown out for a birthday party, the next day in class she said in a platonic tone, \"when did you change your hair?\" giving me little side looks because i look better then her.\nUpdate 6: She has an annoying habit of beginning to talk **** about someone but when I start agreeing she switches it around so that it looks like she is the noble one, and not being a trash talker. She also pursues relationships with guys I used to have a fling with. Like this one guy who I had a thing with a few months ago ignores me now for some reason and she spent days rubbing it in my face how he talks to her on Facebook and doesn't like me anymore. She then called me for nearly two hours\nUpdate 7: sending screenshots of the guy talking to her on Facebook and how he asked her to hang out. Although she knows i no longer talk with the boy meaning i do not care about him, she went on and on about him as if she knew him better than I did. She was so certain he was in love with her just because he texted her to spite me. I even told her he was just texting her to get at me but she refused to listen. Then when he never texted her again after that day she started trashing him\nUpdate 8: What she doesn't seem to understand is that I have zero interest whatsoever in her relationships or personal life, yet she will always tell me dumb stupid stories about some boy she kissed blah blah blah but when i try to bring up something important that i need to talk about she will just give one sentence answers and then not text me for hours pretending er phone was dead so she could avoid conversation about anything but herself.\nUpdate 9: She also always feels the need to tell me every assignment she has to do and how much work she has. Like, we're in college you're not the ONLY one who's busy and stressed out. She acts like she's the only person in the world who has responsibilities and snapchats pictures of her studying for no reason at all.. this is not high school where everyone is competing in the exact same classes. We are in college and we're adults, doing our own thing our own way there's no need to try to one-up me and\nUpdate 10: compare yourself to me because what you do in class has no impact on my life whatsoever. She needs to tell me every thing she's studying and what she's majoring/minoring in all the time yet when i decide to talk about school she acts uninterested and doesn't even look like she's listening. She is competitive to the point of being juvenile and its just weird\nUpdate 11: like in one of our econ classes i took out notes i had outlined from the textbook and she hadn't prepared anything. I didn't even notice or care but she felt the need to justify herself when she saw i took notes by saying she already knows the material and was so busy doing \"6 hours of calc hw\" to take notes. i was sitting there confused like did I ask you?!?! When she sees I write something down during lecture she quickly looks at my notebook and copies it down and she taps me to show me\nUpdate 12: her notes and ask if they are right like you know that's right why are purposely tapping/distracting me for your own self-benefit?! We have i-clicker question in that class and before I could even read the question she taps me to try and explain the answer and when I don't agree she argues about why she's right. Then when she gets it wrong she looks at me badly for her OWN arrogance and says \"I don't even care!\" \nShe will FaceTime me just to show me that she's hanging out with people or going to a party, and always talks about every single damn thing she does on the weekend as if I give a rat's ass. She gets all silent and moody when I'm with friends and we're all talking normally about something that's not about her yet she expects me to remember names of people she was friends with in 4th grade when she retells stories about them. She always needs favors when it comes to boys, and even once asked me to help her clean her dorm room just because some guy she met on tinder was coming over. She talks about random cute boys from her classes that i don't give a shit about and tells elaborate stories about how they made eye contact. She sends screenshots of her tinder matches and texts them to me asking me to guess who the person is even tho i never fucking know or care.. She interrupts me when I start talking and never shuts the fuck up by telling an hour long story about the most pointless shit AHHHHHHHHHH. Someone vent with me, lol. If you read all of this, ur awesome <3\n"

I mean they try to express their friends being special snowflakes when really it's them that is the actually snowflake. I mean, just because you like other things doesn't make you a special snowflake, that's just your preference. I don't care if you listen to Vocaloid, or if you listen to Pierce the Veil. I get it everyone has there own taste in music, just please stop flaunting around what kind of music you like, or bringing down everyone else who's music isn't like yours. Just stop. Or I don't care if you watch anime, or watch PPG. Everyone has there own taste because everyone is different, some will like what things you like, but others wont, but that is not an excuse to think you're better than them. Or calling someone a slut or whore because they wear short shorts, or tanktops. That's just what they're comfortable in, or they at least want to look nice, or atleast what they think in there version is nice, just because you rarely show skin doesn't make you any better. I mean hell I always wear a sweatshirt only because I'm always cold, I don't wear it because I think I shouldn't show my skin. Sorry if this sounds ironic, but it's just what I think, anyway do you guys know any special snowflakes?? I know one person who acts like their whole world is shit. They go on like they have depression, or how they cut, or how they're allergic to alot of things, and how they have to take medicine, or how they don't like talking about it but always brings it up. It annoys me, like my friend gave my snowflake friend a bracelet that says, \"Happy\" and whenever we're around she just asks, \"Why did i get this bracelet? I'm depressed.\" Word for word. And it annoys the shit out of me, I get it you're depressed you could talk to us about it, but please don't bring it up every second of the day. Or my friends will just play a simple game of \"Finish my Story\" and she always tries to bring up her life, about how she is moving or how she is depressed, and it bugs me because we'll just be in a middle of a good funny story then she'll be like, \"Wait guys, I have a story. Once upon a time there was a girl named (her name) and she was depressed and told her friends that she was moving, and that she would never see them again. The end.\" and it bugs me, I get it you're moving you told us for a long time, you also told us about depression and how you have it, but please stop ruining the moment. Then we'll walk in silence for a few minutes around the track, and I'll just say something like, \"That was random,\" Or, \"Uhm okay? Let's just finish the story!\" and I'll laugh and she looks at me like I just murdered someone! Or she'll say that we didn't let her talk about a \"serious talk\" during school, but she doesn't even bother to tell us over text because, \"We're not going to take it seriously.\" What? Or one time she said, \"GUYS I'M GOING TO THE WORST PLACE FOR CHRISTMAS.\" and we'll go, \"Where?\" in the group chat, and she's all like, \"I'M GOING TO DISNEY LAND! (insert crying emoji 5 times)\" and I'm just sitting there looking at my phone and mind you, none of us (Us being my friends) have been to disney land and she's complaining about it?

I get it she has problems and she could talk to us, but atleast please STOP TELLING US EVERY SECOND OF OUR LIFE. I'm sorry if I sound rude but on how many times she brings up her 'problems\" a day is incredible. Anyway this is my special snowflake story, and If you have any stories then.. share them?

A week later I was at work and my boss asked me to take a receipt over to another local business that we operate with. The road I was crossing was a four lane with a turning lane in the middle. In a small town like mine, everyone can just cross the first two lanes and wait in the turning lane to cross the other two. So I crossed the first two and here I am, standing in the turning lane waiting on an opening in traffic,when a police car on the inside lane is coming my direction. I watch it ease towards the turning lane and his inside tires cross the yellow line into the middle where I am standing. I freaked out. Well he got close to me but I backed up, almost into traffic behind me, but he was close enough to me that I could see him on his iPhone. And better yet, it was the same guy that pulled me over for texting and driving. Seriously I should have let him hit me and sued. Anyone else had an experience catching an officer thinking he is above the law? A state trooper also told me about when he got his new charger and took a friend on a joyride and got it up to 168 mph on a 55 mph highway. It really grinds my gears."

Once they go on a rant, just say, next time there is a crisis, you can get drafted for the war just like us, and be away from your family for possibly years. If they say that is truly fine with them, they pass, but MOST will say no.

This is against Feminists that are HYPOCRITES (and yes, lots of them exist where I am) also, equal pay, opportunity, and more all sound great.

I signed up for anatomy and physiology. \n\noff that topic, im in a medical terminology class, and tonight when I get there after my fucking 45 minute commute, we find out that the professor weve had since august is now not teaching the class due to \"personal reasons\" and a new, weird guy is taking over. He just got the assignment to take this class TODAY, actually a few hours prior. So for a half hour, hes going back and forth with other students asking what we were doing in this class. then he says, \"ok well next week were gonna do these chapters so ok bye\", and I stand up and go \"are you kidding me I drive almost an hour out just for this class today and youre basically saying were doing nothing all week? (its a night class once a week)\" hes like \"unfortunately I have nothing prepared\". SWEET SO I WASTED SO MUCH FUCKING GAS WHEN I COULD HAVE FUCKING STAYED HOME.\n\nBack to the classes, I get a letter in the mail today saying that the class I scheduled for last month was apparently just the lab class and someone nicely scheduled me for the lecture at 8 AM 3 DAYS A WEEK.

She only lets me go to the gym twice a week but shed rather pay a private bus $30 a week to take me home and do nothing but sit down and do shit. With driving she only lets me drive until I brake too hard or make any small mistake, in this case she flips the fuck out and makes me switch seats. When I first started going to get togethers and getting popular she said I could only go to every other party and when I asked why she said because she felt like it. No reason why. She is also super lazy and when Im doing something and she tells me to get her water or anything and it takes me a while to respawn she starts yelling until I do it but god forbid I ask her for something.\n\nI dont know what to do shes driving me crazy with all of these rules and honestly im not one of those teens that run away because I wouldnt have anywhere to go and I shit you not, I'd probably get punished if I return.

They were having a sale on eggs that day, so my mom decided to buy that huge as fuck carton of 60 goddamn large eggs.\n\nAfter getting the rest of the groceries, we load up the car and my mother decides that 6 year-old-me is careful enough to hold this heavy-ass box of unfertilized chicken embryos.\n\nBut not before leaning in real close and saying, \"Si tu rapturas un solo huevo, te voy a dar una chinga tan buena que nunca te la vas a olvidar.\"\n\nTranslation: If you break a single egg, I will beat you so hard you will never forget it.\n\nWell, that terrified me and my tiny hands tried to hard to clamp down on this big box. Unfortunately, I'm the biggest fucking fuck-up and the eggs began to break. With each lurch of the car or break, I could hear the shells cracking. Before I knew it, two huge egg yolks dripped out onto my lap.\n\nMy mother saw. She screamed, \"PINCHE BABOSA!\" (FUCKING RETARD!), park the car on the side of the road and proceeded to get out of the car. She grabbed me by my hair, pulling me out and letting the rest of the eggs crash all over the street.\n\nThis enraged her even more. She shrieked at me to stand still, then bent down and began to collect the remaining surviving eggs. Then, one by one, she threw them at me. They mostly hit my shoes, but all I could do was cry silently as she screamed over and over again about how stupid I was, how I was a failure, how I never listened to her, that I was rebellious and lazy...\n\nOh god. My stomach is cramping up. Ugh, this memory hurts, man! But I gotta get it out, dammit!\n\nSorry about that. Anyway... After she destroyed the eggs, she proceeded to land as many hard slaps across my back, head, ass, etc that she could reach. All this while heavy traffic is passing us. No one fucking stopped. But why would they? I obviously deserved all this shit. I'm a bad person. I need to be put down like the mangy dog I have always been. Absolutely trash.\n\nMy mother then lifted me by my hair again, threw me back into the car, and we went home. My father never exited the vehicle during the entire time. He refused to step-in. He wouldn't even look at me when I was back in the car.\n\nWell, we get home... And my mom notices that there is now egg yolks and whites all over my shoes, tracking down into the car carpet. She then noticed that, during her beating, I had pissed myself in fear. Disgusted, she screamed at me for being a fat, dirty pig and ruining her car and my clothes, before telling my father to take me inside to clean me up.\n\nDad and I didn't talk at all while he changed me. That is until he decided to give me this golden piece of advice,\n\n\"You know this was your fault. You need to listen to your mother next time. Then these things won't happen.\"\n\n... FUCK! I AM SO FUCKING-GODDAMMIT!\n\n"

I was involved in a nation wide extracurricular program during highschool (will not be saying what it was called, but it was in Canada). In his program, we had what we called participation guidelines. These were basically a set of rules that we brushed up on 2 or 3 times a year, as well as on the first day of any multi-day/night exercises. Two of these were \"right to pass\" and \"responsibility to try.\" Now, these seem pretty simple, you have the right to opt out of an activity, but you should have a legitimate reason to want to do so. Unfortunately,  while the right to pass is pretty clear cut in its meaning, responsibility to try is a little more vague an open for interpretation. The problem being that the interpretation held by the entire leadership of this damn program, basically negated the right to pass. The right to pass gives you the ability to look at the climbing wall, say, \"I'm afraid of heights,\" and go hang out with the other passers for an hour. But some idiots higher up, decided that instead of responsibility to try, meant EVERYONE who was physically capable, had to at least try to do something, completely ignoring potential psychological issues. This was less evident my first year in the program, but my second year it started to go downhill. One day, we were doing rock climbing on an actual cliff face. Now I had tried indoor rock climbing and was terrified by it, so here was no way I was getting up on that wall. I expressed this desire well in advance, but, when myself and one other guy were left the only ones who hadn't climbed, all the adults were really pushing us. After another person who isn't afraid of heights volunteered to help me, I very reluctantly clipped in. 2 feet up the wall, I'm already freaking out, by 5 feet (I should point out I'm over 6 ft so from my perspective it was much higher) I'm very nearly having a panic attack. After 10 minutes death gripping the wall I finally convince them to let me come down, and that I'm not going another damn inch up that wall. I'm finally down, visibly shaken, and now they're trying to get the other guy up\n Now he's more scared of heights than I am, and he's flat out refusing. He could see the fear in my eyes and had no desire to get on that wall. It takes a CO practically yelling at him about the responsibility to try and how we were setting an example for the basics (this exercise was split into three groups, basic, advanced, and national, and it should be pointed out that the basics weren't fucking there). He finally just says fuck it and clips in, he gets half as far as me and is even worse off. So now they've got two teenagers scarred for life and they're patting themselves on the back for enforcing the responsibility to try, by pretending the right to pass which we had discussed 5 days earlier just didn't exist. (A little long but I'm leaving it as is)\n\nTL:DR, right to pass and responsibility to try are great guidelines, but misuse of the latter negates the former\n\nSorry for wall of text, I need a snickers, I don't press enter when I'm hungry"

Now, it's actually not the cable companies that are at fault, but they have the clout to make a difference, but fail to do so!\n\nI'm talking about commercials, of course. These television broadcasters have gone completely off the fucking rails. They put at least 5 minutes of commercials into every 10 minutes of content. It's absolutely ridiculous! If I watch an hour long episode of, say, Lethal Weapon, I get at least 20 minutes of commercials. It's nuts. Not to mention the overall content and selection sucks. Meanwhile, I can have an amazon prime, hulu, and netflix account, with no advertising, a much better selection, and a mere fraction of the monthly cost of network television. \n\nMeanwhile these morons, these out of touch jackasses, continue to try to make up new ways of attracting customers, and all the while wondering at their shrinking customer bases! Their answer is to jack up prices, add more commercials, and lobby against online streaming.\n\nThe cable companies respond by introducing data caps to punish their customers for online streaming and video downloads. A subscription to Starz or HBO costs a mere dollar less per month than my Netflix subscription. That's right; a single channel costs about the same as an online video library with thousands of available movies and television shows. How on God's green earth does that make any sort of sense?! \n\nI can't wait to see what the television entertainment industry is like in 20 years. These greedy stupid fucks have been sucking people's wallets dry for decades, and now that internet speeds and quality have advanced to an acceptable level, they're getting hit right where it hurts: their bank accounts. \n\nI hope these dumb shits keep going down the same path. It will be a source of great pleasure to watch these broadcast companies go tits up one after another over the next twenty or so years.\n\nOh, and while I have always been against theft of any kind, in lieau of the theft that the broadcast companies have been involved in for years, I refuse to pay for quality television. I will certainly continue watching Game of Thrones, but you can bet your sweet ass I won't be paying for it. I'm getting charged a hundred and fifty bucks a month for TV, and having to sit through commercials on top of that. As far as I'm concerned, these fuckers have already been paid, and they won't be receiving a red cent more from me."

I bought the car brand new but since it was starting to show age (2008 model, 160,000 miles) me and husband decided to buy a new car. The neighbor across the street noticed and wanted to know what we were going to do with the car. I said I was going to sell it but she wanted me to let her make payments. Very stupidly I agreed and called my husband to run it by him first. Being the nice people we are we thought this was a way to help someone out. She cried happily, promised to make payments every single month yadda yadda she piled on the bullshit thick. And I was idiot. \n\nA month and a half later she paid half a payment. Two weeks later the rest of the payment. And nothing since and she's had it since May. We agreed on 3,000 total. Why don't I repo the car, you ask? Because I was a dumbass and didn't put my name on there as a lien holder. I honestly thought individuals couldn't - only finance companies. All we have is two signed receipts. All I can do is everyday hope the car's motor blows up. \n\nMy husband confronted her last week and was like look you either catch it up or give the car back. He was being a total hardass because being nice wasn't getting us anywhere. The messed up thing is her mother drives it more than she does. They are so messed up they turned the engine off coming down the road and rolled it into the storage building but little did they know we were watching them lol. They're faces were priceless when they shut the building door and they noticed us. Guess what? They are now moving. She gets a basically free car, and we get burned. To me she is a thief. This has totally hardened me and I will never help anyone out anymore because people just don't give a fuck anymore. I've always done my best to help people when I can. It would different if she at least gave 20 here and there to let me know she won't totally screw us over. \n\nAn attorney said we won't get the car back but we can sue them for money. It isn't worth it though because it will just cost us. I would feel guilty as hell if I did something like that to someone. Ugh fuck helping people out!!!!"

I've already got enough bullshit to deal with. I just want to get this done and out of the way so that I don't have to worry about it anymore. My future is at stake here."

This might be another big factor leading to this pile of sh*t I've landed myself in.\n\nI honestly don't expect any reader because I'm writing here mainly to keep my anger in check, and also just to systematize my thoughts on this. If there's anyone reading this super long as rant, I apologize in advance for any writing mistakes. I'm honesty enraged like damn writing this and I'm punching the keys on my keyboard like there's no tomorrow. I write in a manner suggesting that I'm telling this to someone, but tbh it's just to get it out of my head. Also I'm not entirely sure if this should be in this sub or the rant sub, but following my judgement I'm going to post it here.\n\n-----\n\nI'm still living in this flat until next week. The flat has 2 rooms, 1 closet room which I assume is off-limit to me (and I have no desire to go inside so I never did), 1 shower, 1 separated WC, 1 kitchen without stove or microwave. There's a big \"living room/area\" - basically most of the lower level is unused and has a lot of random stuff lying around like bikes, tools, decorating pieces. Most of them are covered in dog fur. The place is decorated pretty funky but I suspect that's not the work of my flatmate. The reason for that suspicion is because I can't bring myself to believe that someone who decorated his place with such details would leave it completely filthy and covered in dog fur, and rarely have I seen him clean anything except for the base of his dish rack once, and occasionally emptying the trash cans (obviously because they're filled up every once in a while). I used the trash can in the kitchen a few times at first, but then I felt edgy since I didn\u2019t empty it so now every time I prepare food and have some trash, I put it in a separate bag and take it up to my room to throw it away myself. I'm not sure if my flatmate is the owner, because he kept emphasising that I have to pay rent on time so he could pay the whole rent.\n\nI don't want to state my flatmate's real name here since I'm afraid it might violate some rules somewhere or even his privacy, but let's say his name is John Doe. When we first contacted he said his name was Doe. I only realized his full name when I accidentally look at an envelope addressed to him. (It was on the table in the living area, there was no content on the envelope except for his name and this address. I did not purposely look, my eyes were just moving around as I walked into the flat.) I mean, why wouldn't you tell your flattee your full name? I ended up never addressing his name in texts. This is an odd detail and probably adds nothing to the story, but it stood out to me from time to time so I just want to mention it briefly.\n\n**Some faults of mine** I will totally admit to because it's true that these are my bad:\n\n+ At the first viewing, I didn\u2019t look at the place more thoroughly, and did not consider my own preferences more seriously. I thought that with this price, I can suffer through anything. But once I started living in this place, I realized that there are a lot of small things that can collectively take their tolls on me and make me super stressed, such as the lack of personal space, the lack of washing machine, the lousy shower, the kitchen that has a lot of flies and no stove, dog fur everywhere, etc.\n\n+ I did not pushed for a contract, or tenancy agreement, or any legal document that has a record of our common terms, the price we agreed on, how it's paid, the bond number, any personal preferences, etc. This is mostly because I don't understand the law clearly enough when I totally should - it's for my own benefits after all.\n\n**Some issues:**\n\n+ My room has no \u201cdefinite\u201d doors or windows. My room door can\u2019t be fully closed. I was provided about a yard of elastic rope with hooks on both sides. Once end is hooked to the pipe next to the door and the other end supposedly is for me to hook on the doorknob to keep the door close. But even when it\u2019s hooked close, there\u2019s still a 2-3inch gap between the door edge and the door frame, because the door is not the right type for that frame. There\u2019s also a small window looking from the closet room to my room, and it\u2019s just an empty frame (no window doors). The main treat is the biggggg window looking straight across to his area. There\u2019s no window door as well, just a concrete frame about as big as a room door laying horizontally (sorry if it\u2019s hard to imagine). There\u2019s only a thin make-shift curtain for privacy, but especially if there\u2019s light in my room and none outside, it\u2019s basically see-through.\n\n+ There are things that you can only realize once you've moved in for a while. One huge issue with me is noise pollution. When I say this, people might think I'm unnecessarily sensitive, but if you experienced it long-term like I did I don't think you would be more sane than I am. Firstly, my flatmate coughs a lot. We don\u2019t socialize much so I don\u2019t know exactly why, but with the weed and cigarette smell all over the place, I can only assume it\u2019s because of smoking. It really takes its toll on me; he coughs from the moment he wakes up in the morning until night, and even in his sleep. Since there's no closed, personal space (because there's a huge window with just an empty frame in between our rooms), I have to hear his coughing extremely loud. It's like when you're sitting in a movie and someone behind keeps kicking your chair. You don't know when they're going to kick again, and for how long each time, so the whole movie you have to be in constant anxiety and anger. \n\n+ He also watches movies, documentaries, etc. with high volume and sometimes he plays loud music as well. He also clicks his pen and farts loudly. Now I know it might not be my place to dictate whether someone can fart in their own apartment, but my point is that because I'm too used to being alone, these collective sounds make me feel very abused in terms of noise.\n\n+ This might be overreaching, but at night when it\u2019s really quiet, I can hear music and sound from his side which sounds like the radio playing all night every night. It\u2019s not too loud so it shouldn\u2019t bother me but anyways just something I notice. I just want to note down any detail there is about this place.\n\n**UPDATE on the noise situation:** A few nights ago he had a girl over and they played loud, \u201cclub-ish\" music from 8-9pm until almost 2am. When I say loud, it\u2019s friggin\u2019 damn loud. I dislike trending tracks e.g. Bieber\u2019s stuff, and those were most of the songs played, so that made it extra annoying. I didn\u2019t say anything because I thought it was Friday night, so maybe they thought they were allowed to do so, seeing that it\u2019s the weekend the next day anyway. Also, I don\u2019t have a habit to complain about stuff with people (which is not wise sometimes, but it gives me great anxiety if I have to complain about something. I would most likely feel like I\u2019m the wrong party for complaining and disrupting the peace between us.) Besides, I thought I was moving out in less than 2 weeks so whatever. \n\nI got fed up after 12am because I thought they would at least have the decency to turn it off after midnight, but the volume wasn\u2019t even turned down by a tiny bit. So I recorded it with my phone from my windowless room. On Sunday night there was loud music again and I recorded it again. I\u2019m not a bitch; I don\u2019t sit and wait in the dark for the first note of music to play and start recording right away to score some evidence. I let it go on for as long as I could tolerate and if it was still on, then I\u2019d record it just to have some concrete stuff.\n\nThen last night I pulled an all-nighter as usual because exam month. I honestly can't do anything in the morning. At about 3-4am I was hungry so I ate some baby carrots with hummus. I am aware carrot chewing is loud, but I thought it would even out all the times I have to hear him cough. It would never be a problem if there were proper doors and windows separating us. Then after that I was still hungry so I cooked some chicken in my pressure cooker. I tried to wash and prepare everything as quietly as I could, and once I everything was in the pot and I pressed the button, there was no more noise. The pot cooked pretty quietly in my opinion because everything was sealed in. Chicken chewing was not loud.\n\nThen the next day he txted me complaining that my cooking was too loud it woke him up. My light was too bright at night, I shouldn\u2019t keep the light on because it shines right into his room and it\u2019s hard on the electricity bill (which I\u2019m already paying extra). He then asked me to be quieter at night. Seriously? I was raging like shit in my head, and it was so tempting to flick him a sarcastic comeback, but I only replied \u201cOK\u201d because I don\u2019t want any drama especially since I\u2019m moving out soon anyways. Thinking back, I now fear that my \u201cOK\u201d might serve as proof that I admit to these issues being my sole fault.\n\n+ He hardly ever cleans the place. At least ever since I moved in and observed. The house is covered in dog fur and when I first moved in I asked to borrow a vacuum, to which he replied that he did not have one (still doesn't). In fact, there was dried dog poop in my room. That was unacceptable because I actually moved in a few days later than the date we agreed, which should give him quite a lot of time to at least clean the room to appeal to the new tenant (me). Sorry for the gross details, but the pieces of poop were so dry to the point that they broke into dust when I tried to vacuum them, which said a lot about the amount of time it was left there.\n\n+ The bathroom was filthy when I first moved in (the dry areas were dusty and the wet areas were... very nasty), and now it's still the same even though we use it everyday. He hand-washes his clothes, so all of his dirty clothes is thrown in water in a large bin; dirty clothes + water + long time = horrid smell. It was placed right inside the shower area. I honestly hated taking the shower because the smell in the shower was so bad. The sink in the kitchen is full of filth under the steel frame to hold cups and plates. **UPDATE:** these last few days somehow the clothing bin didn\u2019t smell that bad, so my fear of taking showers in my own flat has subdued significantly.\n\nI'll admit, I'm selfish. I could've been the bigger person and clean everything, even if it's just for the sake of myself being able to live clean. But I don't want to take over someone's mess because they neglect it. I don't want to be the maid of the house. I can bear the filth just long enough, so I don't want to clean it for him. The most I can do is clean up after myself so it's always as clean as it was when I first came. I actually did take the 2 bath mats to laundry once. It was such a waste of money because there were only 2 mats for the same amount of money that I would use to wash my 1 week load of clothes. I didn\u2019t want to handwash those filthy pieces of shit but I didn\u2019t want to step on them either, so I decided to take them to the laundromat. Ever since I did that, it has been more than a month and they're still not changed again.\n\n+ Since the space is too open here, sometimes when he wants to invite girls over, I would have to stay out until 10 or later. I initially didn\u2019t mind, even though I'm not a social person and I prefer staying at home, doing stuff on my own especially when I don't have class or work. He recently complained that I'm home too often, he doesn't want someone who's always home (which, he is). He even assumed that I lied about being a student because I \"don't go to class\". This term I only have 2 papers left, and one of them has only one class per week in the evening (the rest of the paper is for discussion and group work). My job doesn't require me to go out every single day. This is not very related, but every time I go out, I would end up going shopping, so that's why I usually stay at home to prevent that. (I know... Bad habit.) But, even if I was a shitty student and kept skipping class and had no job, why is it his business? He\u2019s not the mother-in-law of me (??!!??)\n\n+ This is a mundane thing, but when i first moved in, there was half a pack of toilet rolls left. I would say there was about 4-5 rolls left? I can't remember precisely but there were not so many. I assumed with the high utility bills ($150/week), this is something my flatmate would cover. However when the rolls ran out, he asked me to buy a new pack, which I did. It was not much, I think it was $5-6 or something but it still bugged me because I felt unfair, but I wasn't sure how exactly it was unfair.\n\n+ It's my fault that I didn't ask for a contract right at the beginning. But recently I did finally ask for one, and he said that he didn't want to give me a \"tenancy agreement\" because he would have to prove his income and he didn't want to do that. (I mean why???) Besides, he said, the space was rented out to me on such an incredibly low price so i shouldn't demand anything. That argument is not totally senseless, but it still sounded unreasonable to me. I wasn't the one demanding the rent to be lowered or anything. It's that price with or without me. Without a contract/agreement I'm powerless should any financial issue rises. This is also what I'm fearing the most regarding my bond money once I'm moving out.\n\n\n+ **BIGGEST ISSUE OF ALL (b/c involving money):** On the advertising site, the room was listed for $150/week, plus $150/month for bills. I didn\u2019t think much about the monthly final amount when I moved in. In his initial txt he told me to deposit \u201cone month\u2019s rent of $750\u201d as the bond (which I understood as $600/month + $150 bills). Then when I transferred the first month\u2019s rent of $750, he txted back immediately saying I must transfer $50 more. He said $150/week doesn\u2019t equal $600/month, since one month has more days than 4 weeks. It sounded logical, but thinking back he was the one planted the idea that $750 equals one month\u2019s rent in my head.\n\nAnyways, that was the minor part of it. $800/month is logical enough so I obeyed. He then asked me to deposit another $100 for extra electricity because I use my floor fan too much. That also sounded logical, so altogether my monthly rent is $900. Here comes the confusing part. Initially I set my monthly auto-payment on my mobile banking app at $750/month to his account. It is my bad that I forgot about it, and I will admit to that. \n\nSo: 29/03/2016 in the morning, I transferred $900 manually, thinking I didn\u2019t set auto-payment. Then around afternoon the same day, my mobile banking automatically transferred another sum of $750. Here, I will also admit that it\u2019s my fault for not making the situation clear right the moment it happened.\n\nI waited for him to txt me immediately, saying that \u201cthere\u2019s an extra $750 in my account\u201d, as fast as how he txted me to pay more in the previous month right after I deposited not enough money. Instead, he didn\u2019t say anything. I have severe anxiety about confronting people, so I thought everything is recorded by the bank, I have evidence, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem even if I don\u2019t notify him. I would just deposit another $150 next month and then it\u2019ll all be settled. I WILL ADMIT THIS PART IS MY FAULT. Looking back, I can\u2019t believe how many friggin\u2019 time I got myself into confusing situations just because of my fear of confrontation. I will seriously sweat all over and my heart race will increase, and I will get dizzy if I must confront anyone even if it\u2019s not a bad conflict situation. Sometimes I really hate myself because of that trait.\n\nSo before the 29th of April (I think it was a Friday judging from side details that I remember), I felt uneasy about that sketchy situation with the extra $750. I asked him to check his account to see the $750 I mistakenly deposited last month. He said he can\u2019t check it, it\u2019s all with his accountant and that person is not available till next week. So I said OK as long as you will check it. (Our chemistry has not been too shitty since I moved in so I trusted him. I know it\u2019s unreasonable, but yea).\n\nNext morning, the 29th, I transferred the $150 left. Immediately, he txted me back saying why is it just $150. I replied saying I\u2019ve already explained yesterday. I also sent him a screenshot of my own banking statement, where it clearly showed the $900 in the morning and the $750 afterwards, all came to his account. He replied \u201cDon\u2019t understand. Pay the rent pls.\u201d I got so pissed, but I tried not to sound pissed in my replies because I didn\u2019t want conflict. I told him again to check his account and it would be illustrated clearly there. He insisted that every detail was with his \u201ctax account\u201d, which he couldn't check until the next week.\n\nI then replied saying that he immediately got back to me the last two times I transferred less money than I was supposed to, so clearly he has notification of some sort saying how much money was transferred, and when. Going by that logic, obviously he would also have a record by the same mean, showing that I transferred an extra $750 in March. He replied saying that he got notification on his phone when a transfer was made, and that was how he knew the times I transferred less money. But to check past transfer, everything must go through his \u201ctax account\u201d, which was unavailable till the next week. Wtf is this logic? I was so dizzy with anger I didn\u2019t even notice how illogical his argument was.\n\nHe urged me to pay the $900 for April, saying that he had to pay the full rent immediately. He said that when he checked for the $750 and saw I was telling the truth, he would refund that to me. By now I felt super edgy about the whole thing, so obviously I refused to do so. I don\u2019t necessarily struggle too much financially, but I\u2019m not the richest student in the world. The $750 was already a large extra sum, so even if I wanted to transfer a new $900 to him, I couldn\u2019t. I told him that he should definitely be able to pay the total rent to whoever he was paying to, because the $750 was definitely there. He replied saying \u201cFine, don\u2019t pay the rent. I\u2019m giving you 3 week notice. You must move out by the 22nd.\u201d Then he also moved on to complain about how I was always home, seemed I lied about being a student because I hardly went to class, etc. (irrelevant, and not his authority to comment on).\n\nI replied saying that there was no \u201cDon\u2019t pay the rent\u201d because it was frigging paid. I moved on to defend my student status (which I shouldn\u2019t have). The thing is I wanted to move out anyways, as I told him already the day before. He made me notify him a month in advance, but since he now gave me the 3-week ultimatum, this bit actually worked to my advantage. \n\nTwo days later he txted me saying that I should tell him when I was going out and coming back because he had people viewing the place. I gave him a brief schedule, adding that people could totally view the place even if I was home. This was when things got a bit more annoying. I told him in that txt that the next day I\u2019d be out at 3pm. Came 3pm and I was almost ready to go out (I ended up going out at 3.10 or 3.15, took a bit long to get ready) when he txted me \u201cYou said you were going out at 3\u201d, like I lied to him. After that, every day he would txt me asking \u201cHey when are you going out today\u201d. Even my parents have never monitor me like that. What if I wanted to have a spontaneous coffee and I didn't know when I would be home from that? Or if class was cancelled? Or if I had a date with someone but we changed the plan? I had nothing to hide so I replied him every time but I still felt like my privacy was violated.\n\nReturning to the $750; he told me that once his \u201ctax account\u201d was available again he would check it, but he never got back to me on that. So after one of those txts asking when I was going out, I replied with a time, following by asking him again to check his account for the $750. This time finally he replied saying \u201cSure, need your D.O.B, full name and account number\u201d. I thought to myself, yessss finally some progress. I txted him my details. He replied with \u201cThanks\u201d, which I took as an acknowledgement of the info, and as a promise that he would finally check that.\n\nThe next day (2 days ago), he txted me asking when I was going out AGAIN, and I replied with the time as well as the question if he checked his account yet. He then replied to me discussing about the time, but did not even mention about the account checking part. \n\nAt this point I\u2019m almost sure he knows about the $750 but doesn't want to clear it up with me. I just don\u2019t know how to deal with this.\n\n-----\n\nWell I\u2019m moving out in a few days and the only thing I\u2019m nervous about right now is whether my bond will be returned in the correct amount. He txted me just now saying that my bond would be returned to me via internet banking, but I\u2019m not so confident that it would be returned to me in full amount. I'm not sure if things got shitty because we don\u2019t like each other or smth, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna be that much of a smoother ride for the next tenant.\n\nI contemplated posting this anywhere, because part of me felt like such a brat complaining so much, especially when I didn\u2019t have the balls to complain it straight to the other person\u2019s face. I\u2019m also not entirely sure if I should ask for legal advice from some source, if it\u2019s worth it or if it would actually work since I don\u2019t have any contract or tenancy agreement.\n\n"

Its been hot and so they have been shut up in a hot house with probably no food or water for days.\n\n\n   The barking has become nonstop and I am worried these dogs are going to die,  i called the police to try and get them to help and was told nobody would do anything, and so now I have to just listen to these dogs sounding frantic and its the worst thing ever!

There is no underlying conspiracy by the government to ignore the \"dangers\" of a vaccine in order to get it to market - if so, do you have ANY IDEA how impossibly huge that conspiracy would have to be to be maintained?  You see, it's not only the FDA looking at this stuff - in order to sell to any other part of the world, that regulatory agency inspects the company before agreeing to buy the product.  So the company would not only have to \"pay off\" the FDA, but also the European Union, the MDHA (Australia), Japan, China, etc. and so forth.  My Christ, get it together, it's not possible!\n\nAnd for all the people claiming the stuff in the vaccine is more dangerous, FUCK YOU!  All of the ingredients that go into a vaccine, including the FUCKING SUGAR used to grow some cells, are tracked and tested rigorously for YEARS before a process can be put into place and approved to manufacture something that goes into a human.  Just because you can't pronounce the name of the fucking chemical doesn't mean people don't know what it does or how it acts in the body!\n\nAnd yes, even though I'm vaccinated you DO pose a fucking risk to me!  Why?  You're giving the virus additional breeding grounds by being susceptible!  All a virus needs to do is find a host and mutate around the vaccine for it to be unstoppable, and infect people that used to be protected.  That's it! \n\nThe true fucking irony here is that non-vaccinated people get the protection from those of us that aren't stupid and got vaccinated, so their \"I NEVER GOT THIS SHOT AND I'VE NEVER GOTTEN SICK OH MY GOD\" excuse isn't valid in the slightest!\n\nTL, DR: Fuck you, anti-vaxxers, and rot in Hell."

            "value": "For almost the whole year I had to work with this damn \"teammate\" for two group projects in uni.  His work ethic just makes be go GGGRRRGGHHH! Let's call this lazy guy \"Joe\". \n\nFor the first project this year which was done last semester, Joe did no work at all despite me giving him all the necessary resources and direction, even when I tell him to ask me any questions and clarification. I've practically done most of the work along with an actual hard-working teammate. By the end of the project, the only thing Joe finished was a single asset. Group members are all given the same grade for the final project. My project earned one of the highest grades out of my entire class. Yes that also means Joe gets a high grade......................I'm sure you can see why I'm pissed.\n\n\nFor my second current project, I tried to stop Joe from joining my new team at all cost since I didn't want to deal with his lazy ass bullshit. What shits me though is one of my new teammates happened to be friends with Joe and they weren't aware of Joe's work ethic, if you could even call it that. Annoyingly Joe ends up being in my new team.\n\nMy team is two and a half months into the current project and guess what? JOE'S BEING A FUCKING LAZY ASS AGAIN! I've even dumbed down some of his workload in hope he could at least finish simple tasks, but at this point I don't see why I even bothered....\n\nI've created private chats on Facebook for my team for organization and I can see exactly when each member has seen a message. In almost all instances, Joe doesn't read the messages and I KNOW he uses Facebook on his phone. I AIN'T BLIND! I CAN SEE THROUGH THIS BULLSHIT.In this day and age, I highly doubt most people don't use Facebook at least once a day.\n\n\nWhenever I assign a task to Joe, I say \"Are you 100% sure you can finish this by x?\" and then Joe's like \"Yeah no problem. I can get x done by tonight\". If you can't keep your end of the bargain, DON'T BLUFF AND SAY YOU CAN DO SOMETHING WHEN YOU CLEARLY CAN'T!\n\nI've had enough of this fucking bullshit. Me and my new teammates have worked really hard and I'm not going to let Joe earn another high grade from doing nothing. I plan on bringing this up to my tutor and do whatever it takes to make sure Joe does not earn the same grade as me and my teammates. He doesn't deserve it. Honestly I don't even know if my tutor will intervene.\n\n\nI have no idea what to fucking do anymore. Joe's non-existent work ethic has essentially put a huge workload on me and it's FUCKING stressing me to no end. If only if I could just punch him in the face once. HECK a single punch wouldn't even begin to relieve me.\n\nOh Joe......why am I so fucking lenient to you? If I were to rage at Joe, he won't work. If I continue being nice to Joe, won't work. Such a shame that I can only be passive-aggressive. \n\nFUCK YOU, JOE! FUCK YOU!"

This is especially the case for video games, seeing as many games nowadays don\u2019t even come in the package finished! Oh well, I guess I can play the Dark Souls series and hone my skills\u2026\n\n\u201cDude, you things today suck ass compared to how they were back in the early days. I feel I was born in the wrong time period. I\u2019d rather go back to the 80\u2019s and play on arcade machines, ride a skateboard and..\u201d\n\nHEY ASSHOLE, it\u2019s 2016, and the 80\u2019s are more than 30 years back in time. Plus, aren\u2019t you, like, 21? Not to mention, if you seriously want to live in the past, you can do that. Go out and buy a T.V. with vacuum tubes inside, buy an NES, buy a lava lamp and a cassette player while you\u2019re at it!\n\nJesus Christ, I know that people like these have been around since, I dunno, like the 50\u2019s, but one thing that really pisses me off about people these days is the fact that nostalgia runs their psyche. As if they live off of the space-time aura that encompasses the before time, and that they have to suck the life out of the things in the olden ages. You know I\u2019m kidding about that part, but I don\u2019t have too much tolerance for people who complain about the modern day.\n\nNow, I have to give some of these people credit where credit is due though. Because, without the human feeling of nostalgia, we wouldn\u2019t have a reason to look back at the things we used to love as a species. I remember when we kids used to hangout at the weirdest locations and just talk about nonsense all day. I mean, we have some of those in our congress, but that discussion is for another day! Anyway, we\u2019d have our Gameboys, comic books, Saturday morning cartoons, and toy guns for play. For me, more specifically, I always doodled on anything I could get my hands on, and I can vividly remember how I used to have a fuck ton of imaginary friends at my behest because I only had, what, one other friend for my whole existence up until now. \n\nWait, wasn\u2019t this supposed to be a rant or some shit? Oh yeah!\n\nNostalgic thinking, at its core seeks to give a feeling of compassion for something that gave us happiness in the past. The problem with people who constantly talk about Asteroids and 80\u2019s hair is that they always complain about the fact that \u201cthings today aren\u2019t as good as they were in the 80\u2019s\u201d or 90\u2019s or even the early 2000\u2019s, to this current day. What\u2019s the reason for this downpour of the pessimistic view of the present day? Was it really as good as you think it was? Or were you too much of a fucking child to see the bad things that happened behind you as you played with your toys?\n\nMemories have lots of validity, but there is just too much in the way of the true memory to see what actually happened. And, in fact, I\u2019m pretty sure that is true, because according to many studies involving the memory of people in their 30\u2019s and up, their memories aren\u2019t correctly stated as true. This is because the feelings, emotions, stimuli, and mental development of a person changes overtime to accommodate new information that we swallow up everyday.\n\nMy God, if this isn\u2019t enough to sway someone\u2019s opinion, then maybe I should take it another step forward, you sack of shit!\n\nRemember pogs? Well, actually they had a lifespan of a couple of years, making them age faster than the equivalent of that in the milk that they were popped off of!! Remember furbies? If you consider those a good use of human energy, then let me just tell you that they\u2019ve had at least two revivals in the last two decades, because some jackass decided, \u201cHey, remember those little furballs they used to sell? Why don\u2019t we appeal to our audience of 25 to 30 year olds and make them again!\u201d\n\nMy God\u2026 At least video games age better than those fads of the past. Let\u2019s take a look at something like Castlevania II - Simon\u2019s Quest. I know, it\u2019s a bad choice. But, just look. LOOK. This piece of shit was on one of the first consoles that Nintendo made, and rightfully the most memorable. Back in the mid-80\u2019s there wasn\u2019t too much to start with, but a lot came out of said console. We got a lot of good games, and a lot of shitty games like Simon\u2019s Quest. It deviates from the first game, making it have RPG elements, quests, secrets, and game mechanics that equal those of madness! The same thing happened to The Legend of Zelda, with its second iteration being more of an RPG adventure type. More people have respect for this sequal, simply because it does a better job at utilizing its features, like spells, power meters, and attacks.\n\nThe NES, the time it lived in, didn\u2019t have a quality standard, which is pretty much required today. Shit like all those unlicensed games would NOT slide. That is why the SNES was made in 91\u2019, because the point of nostalgia and past remembrances is to IMPROVE. If all you do is look back on something that made you wish you wanted to live in that time period, and scoff at the advances we\u2019ve made, then all I have to say is: Fuck you, I\u2019m happy with what I have. You should too!\n\nI guess another aspect of the past people look to is music\u2026 Yeah, I can see why they\u2019d say such things. My God, the music today can be such ass. But, just think for a second, there are thousands of groups, bands, and artists today that make music for almost no payout, and it\u2019s because they love doing it. Don\u2019t you dare tell me there isn\u2019t good enough music to listen to, when there are so many artists making shit just for your entertainment! Many bands I listen to don\u2019t have worldwide acclaim, and most of them still make music in their garage, or at home.\n\nOh my lord, fads. FADS. What makes you think that it\u2019s okay to gawk at fads of past generations and shit on the ones of today? Fads don\u2019t last long for a reason, and that\u2019s because they are meant to entertain our interest for a short period of time, to look cool for the masses or for your friends. It wasn\u2019t meant to be a lifelong obligation.\n\nDon\u2019t even get me started on politics of the past. They were and always will be hiccups in the system. Take Ronald Reagan for instance. I\u2019m very sure that his second term in office started with the onset of alzheimer's disease, and not to mention, he began the war on crime. The war on crime movement has gotten so bad, that innocent people have been sentenced to death row for doing nothing, but getting caught up in the system\u2026 Oh yeah, and \u201cno child left behind\u201d was from an earlier time in history wasn\u2019t it? Look at how our education system is doing right now, considering the fact that WE ARE LOWER IN MATH THAN EVER and people are literally getting dumber these days because of it.\n\nSo yeah, I guess you\u2019re right. The modern day does suck. But there\u2019s many reasons for that, and they all started somewhere. But you can\u2019t just complain about them. Make a fucking difference in the world. Go out and petition for things, talk to whoever is in charge of things, do something! God, the 90\u2019s were the days weren\u2019t they?!"

            "value": "**Background:** I'm a 21 year old recovering heroin addict (7 1/2 months off opiates) who happens to be a male of caucasian lineage. My family has a history of serious mental health/substance abuse conditions; neither my parents were addicts but both had severe MH issues while I grew up; still think pops has a mood and/or personality disorder. My girlfriend of 4 \u00bd years and I recently moved from New England *aka: New Skag-land* to the Mid-west for a plethora of reasons. I\u2019ve completed the institutional gauntlet (rehab twice, psych wards thrice and many detoxes) was homeless from 2013-2016 and spent a brutal winter living in my Honda Accord. I have seen family members struggle to cope with life; uncle committed suicide when I was 12 then another person die from addiction related complications... Lost a few friends to the great beyond as well as the concrete jungle (prison). I was almost a statistic in the war that has lasted **46 fucking years** and counting...\n        \n-  The \"war on drugs\" was *suppose* to be like the \"war on poverty\"; merely a metaphor intended to signify struggle and eventual triumph. I fucking wish.  I was forced to go to rehab at 16 for my first time which was an abysmal failure. I went my second time at 20 for 4 months and it helped a great deal since I applied a lot of what I was taught but never reached the root cause of my addiction. Thankfully I\u2019m about to start seeing a psychiatrist whom hopefully will be able to bring my subconscious to the forefront.   Since leaving rehab in late January I have somehow managed to use weed/one occasional stimulant moderately after 7 years of having no control. I understand if I smoked or used anything daily I would eventually fall back into old behaviors. Like I said rehab helped a lot and got me on my feet but the journey isn\u2019t even near the halfway-point regarding my mental stability. The only topic I can\u2019t personally relate to is growing up in true poverty, I was fortunate in that respect but a home is only as good as those inside it. \n\n- I\u2019ve noticed a lot of regular folk, TV pundits and articles are comparing Trump and Nixon as of late; mentioning watergate and if Trump will be worse/similar to Dick. There\u2019s an understandable collective anxiety about how the next 4 years will pan out but at least he\u2019s pretty damn incompetent\u2026 can't even pass a major piece of legislation with repub. Majorities in the house + senate. Nor is he the most intellectual man to ever *grace* the oval office (Truthfully I think he\u2019s illiterate)... Nixon was not only incredibly brilliant but he \u201csingle handedly\u201d caused one of the most heinous domestic policies ever implemented.  That policy was\u2026 the \"war on drugs\" this one policy effects/affected more Americans and people in the western hemisphere in general in such force the carnage and innumerable suffering is truly unfathomable.\n\n       \n- **Now not all of Richard's motives for implementing the policy were despicable.** Nor was he the mass incarceration king but he certainly got the ball rolling **(Regan was)** The president wasn\u2019t the first to prohibit substances or even be considered to be drug czar; he worried about the youth (due to his known racism he probably only care for the white youth, minus the jews he really hated them) and saw drug use as corrosive to the mind/society; social rot was the exact terminology. The generational gap and circumstances of that time influenced the youth to experiment with sex drugs and music, talk intelligently and openly about the issues while promoting peace. Everything was in the pursuit of self-discovery and unity. Due to how culturally different the two sides were the young were looked upon as if they were suffering an affliction via drug use/lifestyle. There was no relating, communication or interacting; the youth resented the older generation but understood their thought process. The older gen were old fashion so there was a disconnect across the board; the public were quite frankly terrified them. To make things *better* the media outlets released accurate reports of Vietnam troops abusing large amounts of Heroin, everyone expected upon their return the Vets would cause an uptick in crime and burden society as a whole. Don\u2019t get me wrong Heroin was a huge problem particularly with the antiwar/hippie movement, many famous artists died from overdose and the negative qualities were truly fierce/dangerous but the Veterans used it to cope with the brutality of war while the hippies did it purely for recreation. The (soon to be disgraced) president opened up **methadone clinics** and offered treatment options to those who fit the right profile. Overall the majority of Americans were confused, scared and full of anxiety due to such chaotic, turbulent times. Those who don\u2019t seek out change tend to plant their feet in defiance and close their eyes to reality.  \n\n\n- Minorities on the other hand were purely targeted with malicious intent. It was a little over a decade since segregation was made illegal so racial tensions were still extremely high so it logically makes sense the president was a racist. They were stirring the pot and making progress all by their own doing which infuriated the \u201csilent majority\u201d. Nixons\u2019 presidency was a cumulation of pure chaos and the only control/power that was certain was the rule of law. Dick had to show dominance to fill his strong persona and any hesitation would be met with sharp resistance. **\u201cIn 1972, for instance, Nixon's reelection bid sought to capture longstanding concerns about black crime and drug use among white Southerners \u2014 in what's now called the \"Southern strategy.\" To do this, Nixon shifted to the right on drugs with a tough-on-crime platform.\u201d** If the president appeared passive when it came to minorities, specifically African Americans his chances of reelection would fall. It\u2019s not like RN was conflicted about his option another 4 year; after all early prohibition of the 20th century was accomplished by playing off stereotypes and a heavy propaganda campaign that still lingers with the elderly/misinformed folk to this day. Dehumanization that confirms the country's white population of their racial bias\u2019 is a recipe for a silent oppresion under the pretext of justice.\n\n     \n- I hope he didn\u2019t foresee possible unintended consequences that would occur years, decades and persist almost a half century later. The late 60\u2019s early 70\u2019s were boiling over with tension and rage due to civil rights as well as the quagmire that is Vietnam. Nam\u2019 ended up attracting hoards of leftists who were antiwar to their core. The walls were caving in from the pro-peace/civil rights lobby and the final straw for the paranoid egomaniac was when the predominately white pro-peace social organization started supporting one another to pursue a mayridge of progressive agendas from civil rights, eliminating poverty and much more. This signaled the beginning of the end for Washington's status quo; if you follow history/politics then you\u2019re well aware that the establishment is always very comfortable with the status quo and attempt to eradicate all bubble bursters.Times were changing and there was hope galore. All of this became a true thorn in Nixons ass, the already paranoid man (watergate gives clues to his thought process. Dick was ahead by a landslide yet still felt the need to be as certain of victory as possible) felt the pressure so Nixon and his admin. created various drug enforcement agencies, implemented the Controlled Substance Act (CSA), ok\u2019ed no knock warrents, mandatory minimum sentences and more.   \n\n\n\t\n           Don't fear Trump, he may do damage but orange man outdoing nixon? Forget about it.\nThink, do some research and change the world for the better. We don't need anymore ideologues or for you to further validate your confirmation bias, that's for damn sure\u2026  By the way, Reagan was much worse than Nixon. \n"

            "value": "It seems like every single time I have a discussion with someone about gun rights they completely miss the fucking point. It's actually a fairly simple concept to understand. Simply imagine the world without guns, without projectile weapons of any kind. Imagine it realistically, rather than these ridiculous notions some fools have about utopias.\n\nHistory has proven that anything but a utopia would exist. It would actually be nearer to survival of the fittest. While grouping up and forming communities was the primary contribution to our survival, weapons have been extremely important in our evolution by setting one group above another. With weapons like clubs and swords, surviving a hostile confrontation would have been a matter of fitness and dexterity. Truly, a world where the strong are capable of feeding on the weak with little to no repercussions.\n\nThen enter the bow, the sling, the spear, and similar ranged weapons. Even the crossbow. They make survival somewhat easier, but they still require some degree of skill to use.\n\nEnter the gun. Very little skill and practice required for a beginner. Easy to pick up, a little more difficult to master. Suddenly the size of a man's arms don't matter as much. Someone a fifth of his size can defend himself.\n\nGuns are among the best defenses the weak can have. At the very least, they put us all on an even playing field. A man in a wheelchair can be just as deadly as a hulking giant or a trained martial artist.\n\nWhen it comes to violence, and it always does, always has, and always will, guns are the best defense of the weak.\n\nTaking guns out of the hands of the citizens destroys the balance we have with the government. By losing our weapons, we become the little kids in the playground, and that leaves us with nothing but hope that the bigger kid, the government, doesn't turn out to be a bully. Sadly, history proves that is rarely the case.\n\nResponsible use and ownership of guns can secure a community against threats both internal and external. Using mass shootings and other criminal activities as an excuse to restrict, regulate, or ban guns is nothing more than offering a community a bandaid. \n\nInstead, we should be focusing on what causes people to commit said mass shootings, and attempting to get to the bottom of *that* problem. Disarming ourselves is not the answer. \n\nSince 2001 on, we should have learned by now that guns are not necessary for mass devastation and loss of life. In fact, they are not nearly the most efficient weapon for killing. Nor are they that easily accessible (despite certain claims and myths that have grown up around the subject), even in the United States. \n\nIn fact, as a number of high profile attacks in Europe have recently shown us, it's far easier to simply grab a car and drive it through a crowd.\n\nThere are some out there that believe we should simply have a national registry of firearms (already is one...), that should monitor the sale and possession of all firearms. While that already exists to a degree, these same people suggest making private sell illegal (which it is, if you're knowingly selling to someone you believe should not have a gun). Let's be clear; the law already sets up a prevention of any issues arising from private sells to individuals that should not have guns. *If someone is willing to break that law, they are *just* as willing to break the other.* it makes absolutely zero sense to try to ban that. Also, how on god's green earth would you enforce it? Monthly visits? Please....\n\nSince enforcement is damn near impossible, we mights as well just give that up and make it illegal to sell a weapon to anyone that you believe may be a danger... Oh wait, we already do that. \n\nSo if we shouldn't get rid of guns, and we shouldn't monitor every single firearm, then what should we do? Easy; keep the status quo. The laws we have in place on firearms are comprehensive, and possible even a little too restrictive. Especially depending on who you ask. \n\nAs far as mass shootings... great, so that's our issue in the United States. Meanwhile many nations in the middle east have suicide bombers to deal with, and the more western European nations have their own mass violence to deal with (vehicles anyone?). \n\nThe way we deal with violence from guns is the same way we deal with violence from knives, cars, bombs, or even boiling oil. We don't ban it, instead we punish illegal use of it, and do our best to find the root cause of escalating violence. The root cause of escalating violence now days is *not* guns. Guns have existed for centuries at this point. As far as guns that are available to average consumers, there hasn't been much technological advance in many decades. To blame a static item such as weapons an an *escalating* trend does not make sense.\n\nObviously something else is causing a rise in violence. While guns are *not* the cause, they are a protection against the individuals that perpetuate these acts."

I had installed vagrant because /r/php claims it's the solution to all the world's problems. It's sortof like a middle man for VirtualBox (or VMWare if that's what you use). You can configure it to forward ports so you can access stuff on the VM. I HAD TO RESTART MY COMPUTER THREE TIMES BEFORE THE VM WOULD START UP BECAUSE SOMETHING WAS USING PORT 8080 WHICH WAS BULLSHIT.\n\nOnce I finally beat vagrant into submission I had to setup nginx and php. That went okay... for a bit\n\nThen I tried using composer to install laravel as a dependency of my project but why do something sane like that? You have to download the laravel project itself and add your code to it and add ALL THE DAMN CODE TO YOUR REPOSITORY. Composer kept shitting itself by downloading a copy from its host website and OVERWRITING ITSELF INSTEAD OF DOING WHAT I TOLD IT TO DO. I had to go to a third-party site to find out how to properly install laravel.\n\nComposer complains that the json extension for php is not installed. \"apt-get install php5-json\". COMPOSER CAN'T FIND IT BECAUSE THE INSTALL SCRIPTS DIDN'T ENABLE THE MOD. Googled, found how to enable json.\n\nNow composer complains I needed the mcrypt extensions for php. That's fine so I run \"apt-get install php5-mcrypt\" and restart php5-fpm. COMPOSER STILL CAN'T FIND MCRYPT. I search online and get mcrypt working. I try to continue the installation, composer complains that /var/www/laravel is not empty. So I switch to that directory and do \"rm -r *\" and try to do the installation again. It still complained that the folder wasn't empty. APPARENTLY RM DOESN'T DELETE FILES STARTING WITH A DOT. So I deleted the two files rm decided to ignore.\n\nI finally get laravel installed. I go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ and get a blank screen. I check the nginx error log and the JsonSerializable interface doesn't exist. I did some googling [AND THE INTERFACE IS NOT INCLUDED IN DEBIAN'S BUILDS BECAUSE OF LICENSING BULLSHIT](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=63520).\n\nFOUR HOURS OF WASTED TIME SETTING UP SOMETHING /r/php considers to be the greatest thing since sliced bread."

I wanted you to GIVE ME MORE TIME., instead, you would make plans with your brother, even though i asked you constantly to spend time with me, you would give me the same fucking excuse, \"im too tired and busy, and what about me? i dont ever have any time for myself.

She said this is how we should show love, and if I don't listen to her I don't love her. What a sick fuck she is, 10 years older than me. Did she get off to molesting a 7 year old.\n\nWhen ever my father physically abused me, I thought it was purely out love. I thought that I was the problem, and that he was trying to fix me. My mom described me as the spawn of satan, and treated me like shit. Constantly gossiping about me and saying shit behind my back. I always thought that I deserved it and that I was what was wrong.\n\nWhen I was bullied in elementary school, I stole my parent's money to make people like me. It worked for a while, until my parents found out and got all sad. I remember my teacher finding out and then I told her about that my parents would hit me if she told them.\n\nShe found that I had 280 dollars, and she told them anyway and didn't believe me. At the end of the school year, everyone in the class hated me for various reasons. They realized I was just fake, and was not cool at all. So they went back to the bullying, trying to fix this issue the teacher recommended that I have a lunch with the guys from my class.\n\nShe invited all of us, and talked to me about dealing with the tension in the class. I wanted to go, but then when I got there I heard them talking about me again. Calling me a gaywad and stupid shit, and I felt like something snapped in me. I got so angry, and I left and ate on my own. When my teacher saw me later, she yelled me that I wasn't savable I was a lost cause.\n\nI just sneered and left, at that point I tapped into just a little bit of the hatred that was in my heart. After that I went to a different school, where I stayed quiet all the time. People tried to befriend or sit next to me for the first month but I never spoke. I slowly opened my shell a bit, I realized that a group of blonde girls found me funny.\n\nEspecially when I pretended to be grumpy and broody, that made them laugh a lot. I made a lot of friends and had a decent tie with the people at that school. One day I called into the school office, they said there was a package for me. My old teacher who said I was a lost cause had the class write me goodbye letters and a bunch of cheesy shit.\n\nI looked through a few of them, when the lady who gave me the package said I had nice friends. I just started to laugh with malice, then I ripped up the collage and threw it away. I remember vividly the anger as I said to her shocked face \u201cTrash made by trash, fucking idiots.\u201d After that I stole my parent\u2019s money again, I always hated them so stealing didn\u2019t feel bad.\n\nAfter that I had no more bullying, but those fake friends faded away. I got used to being completely alone, and if anything I enjoyed it. I loved when summer rolled around and I could be alone all day everyday. I never kept in contact, I never answered texts even from people that were supposedly my friends and turned down every invitation. I would continue to steal money from my parents to hurt them, and then pretend to have fixed my ways.\n\nJust to steal more money, I had always enjoyed the catharsis of my anger. I could be angry at them consistently for weeks, and one day I beat up my dad for messing with me. I had always been beat around by him, and for once he got what he deserved. But because of that I was sent to my uncle\u2019s house and had to live with his stupid ass for weeks.\n\nI hated it but at least I was away from my parents, since I planned to leave permanently once college rolled in. I decided I needed to be on their good side to survive the one and a half year till college. So I acted very good and kind, hiding all the anger in my heart. By my Senior year of high school. I had online college classes, and didn\u2019t attend school at all for the most part.\n\nEveryday I would dodge people and I actually liked it, I could be free and calm which gave me significant reading time. I learned a lot of things, got a job, wrote 3 published novels and when college started people thought I was funny and smart. Although I was very cold to most people, in groups I made every laugh. Although it is because I am more afraid in groups and I work better under pressure.\n\nWhen it\u2019s one on one, no one\u2019s a threat to me so I act coldly to them without any fear. But I cracked under the pressure of PTSD nightmares and slipped up and told someone about them. She oh so kindly decided to take care of me, and constantly stayed by my side. She became my best friend, and later I met another girl who also decided to take care of me.\n\nShe became my girlfriend, and on separate occasions they each snapped at me. My feelings of loneliness came back, and I realized they are no different from my teacher. I feel so incredibly lonely, no one has any kindness they all just come to have a laugh at how pathetic I am. I have been unable to tap into my anger for a while, but now it is back and it feels good.\n\nIf I am just a fucking joke, then I don\u2019t give a single shit. Screw off world, and all its inhabitants I have always been betrayed. I don\u2019t care enough to believe in good people, I am just sick of constantly being betrayed. No one is kind, and I will never believe otherwise. I don\u2019t care if that makes me pessimistic or if I am just an edgelord or some dumb shit. I don\u2019t give a fucking shit about anything anymore, the whole world can burn for me I just want to stay in my loneliness."

My coworker, who I've always considered a close friend... maybe not anymore, has known about it for awhile, as we're very close outside of work, so we talk a lot. She knows about my relationships and I hers. \n\nFor the past month or so, whenever she sees this guy walking through our department, and we're working on a project or talking or something, she'll make it a point to stop and talk to him and begin flirting with him right in front of me. I don't know if she realizes it or if she's doing it to upset me??? I don't understand. I have never, and would never do that to someone when I knew they were interested and had something going with that person. I mean, yeah, we're not in a relationship, I don't own the kid, but damn if it doesn't hurt. I just find it a little childish to be honest. Even my other coworkers who I am also friends with have noticed it when I'm not around and told me, mainly because they thought we were together, and they were confused, it's that bad, her flirting I should say. I know I need to talk to her but I'm so angry and hurt right now over it that I wanted to get all of this stuff out before I do that so I don't blow up on her. I know it's dumb of me to be so upset over something like this, but maybe it's because I would never do it myself, so seeing someone else do it so shamelessly really bothers me??? I don't know. It's getting bothersome though. \n\nI want to talk to my dude about it and see if he notices it too. Like when she's flirting with him in front of me, he'll joke with her but it seems genuine, and not edging towards romantic, but like she is. I feel like he's not interested, but I want to ask him to make sure. I don't know what to do but I feel better now that I got this out. "

Shouting, denying food, stealing from them. I literally heard about an incident today where they left a kid in a house which was about 30'C (85'F), locked her in and took the air-con remote with them so she couldn't cool it down. These people are fucking evil, but no matter how many times they receive complaints from the kids, other foster carers, or other human beings the foster service does nothing. They verbally abuse and bully children who have already taken too much shit for one lifetime, they get paid for it with my taxes, and they fucking disgust me. \n\nThank you Reddit for being here, I don't know what I would've done.

Then eventually the sales manager decided he wanted to retire so he did that. Nobody liked the star salesman so they fired his ass the next week. \n\nLet me introduce Wayne. He was the guy that stepped into the role of salesmanager. This was a very crucial time for me because while he learned how to do his job he would often talk to me about how things worked. He used to be a teacher so teaching something reinforced it in his mind and he always ate up how interested I was in it. \n\nWayne eventually left to be an LED salesman and right now we are in limbo. I am the acting sales manager now but won't be when we sell the franchise. But because of my new title, if the other salesman has a deal, then I have to drop everything to work it. I have to stop making myself money to go make him money. I get NO EXTRA COMPENSATION for MAKING HIM MONEY. Doing the sales manager job is easy peasy.\n\nWell the other salesman is the biggest dumbass I have encountered ever. There are a few things I need to make a car deal work. If someone says they want their payment to be $200, and they are describing car features of a 30,000 car. Then maybe you should explain that to them. Have a conversation. ITS FUCKING EASY. Hey man, you realize for a $200 car payment at 60 months that is 12,000. So either we can lower our thinking about the car, or I can see what the payments would be for a car that has all of the features you are looking for. Nope, in this salesman's mind, I'm just supposed to lose money on a car to make the customer happy. My bottom dollar on the car they wanted was literally $27000. Where am I going with that much car? I don't keep $15000 worth of gross in my cars. So I tell him no man we need to switch them to this car. Stop selling the car you have them on, you landed them on the wrong car. He says Okay as he walked out. Then he shows them the same car in a different color. This happened until eventually they landed themselves on the car I told him to show them. \n\nSkip to the next scene\n\nHe comes in and tells me okay, they want payments. I said, \n\n'Did you create a deal?' \n\n'Oh, no, do I need to?'\n\n'Well I need a deal number'\n\n'Oh, okay'\n\nThat is EVERY FUCKING DEAL. EVERY DEAL needs a deal number. EVERY DEAL needs a paper trail. \n\nHe goes and creates me a deal and comes back.\n\nI say'Okay, so what do I need to do'\n\n'I need payments on the car you landed them on'\n\n'Did you get a credit app'\n\n'Oh no, do I need one?'\n\n'Well I need a credit score to assess the APR'\n\n'Oh, okay' \n\n\nGoes to fill out app.\n\nComes back without an unfilled app.\n\n'What's the best APR you think you can get her?'\n\n'So are you selling her APRs now or are you filling out the credit app?'\n\nHe shot me a look. 'Okay man'\n\nHe came back with a signed credit app.\n\nI said \"Is this how you spell this name? He's only been on the job for a year, I need another year work history, also I need a work phone number, I need the physical address of his home, not the P.O. Box, and there is not enough numbers for his social security. \n\nHe looks at me like I'm dumb, snatches the paper from my hands, and points at the work history on the back of the paper, and then shoves the paper back on my desk.\n\nI said 'Okay, thank you, I also need what he did there, the address there, and the phone number there.' (Which the banks don't need but they all have a space for me to put them into and if he wants to act like a dick, then I can be a dick.)\n\n2 trips and another credit app later I pull credit. He then tells me there is a trade. I ask him what they appraised it for.\n\nHe says' 'Well, I haven't gotten it appraised.' \n\n'Why not?'\n\n'Because you haven't appraised it yet'\n\n'Holy shit dude, how many times do I have to tell you take it across the street, I'm not going to invest $20000 of someone else's money without someone giving me formal training.'\n\n'Oh, okay'\n\nHe comes back about 30 minutes  later, customer waiting.\n\nI said' What took you so long?'\n\n'Oh I ran into Maryann. Her dad is real sick and may need a kidney transplant and she m--'\n\n'Dude, you all ready have her money. You have a customer over here waiting on you and you are going to make them want to take their money elsewhere.'\n\n'Oh, okay'\n\nSo finally I put numbers together and I send him into his office with them. He comes back.\nHe says' they don't like those payments.'\n\n'Okay, I don't like bills either, where do they want them at?'\n\n\"I don't know'\n\n'Why don't you know?'\n\n'I didn't ask.'\n\n'Why didn't you ask?'\n\n'I don't know'\n\n'Okay, well I hope you like making minis because I'm going to give them all of your gross.'\n\n'Fine.'\n\nHe calls me into the office.\n\nThey want me to come off another $60 a month. \n\nIt was there, but I didn't do it. I closed them instead.\n\nThey were jumping from a vehicle that got 12 in city to one that got 32 in city. Nearly triple the gas mileage.\n\nI said 'Man, what is a gas bill other than a car note that you put into your tank, am I right?'\n\nThe guy nodded his head\n\nlong story short he told me to send it into the banks\n\nI had the salesman put it together. The bank sent back that I had mispelled the name. The salesman had filled this book worth of paperwork out with the wrong fucking name. I called him and told him to refill it. In not so nice words I might add. Finally he had enough of the verbal abuse and \nsaid 'YOU ACT LIKE I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THIS FOR NINE YEARS!'\nI said 'NO, YOU ACT LIKE YOU HAVEN'T DONE THIS FOR NINE YEARS. I WOULD HAVE SENT ANY OTHER SALESMAN BACK INTO TRAINING ALL READY. BUT YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE I'VE GOT.'\n\nHe paused with his mouth open for a second. He brought my packet back to me 10 minutes later.\n\n'They want TTL included' \n\nmind=blown\n\nWe have to fill out the paperwork again.\n"

Monday to friday they start at 6:45 am, it is very loud and most of the time the walls and floor are shaking. Today, a saturday, they are working, too. Starting at 7 am with scraping stone off the ground and hammering on new cobblestone for the road to the bridge. The metal \"klonk klonk\" drove me insane. I'm a student and I am in the middle of my exams right now. I could not work during their working hours during the week but I calmed myself thinking about the weekend. It's normal that they are working during the week but this morning it was enough. I have to learn very much and also have to build things, a 13 hour day is normal for me and I am not getting anywhere near a health amount of sleep. So I went down and talked to them rather harshly but they were just \"No, we start early so we can call it a day at the right time\". Why on earth do building workers have to start so early and not think about others? Most people say \"It's simple: go to bed early\". But I can't, I have to learn and work, too. Why do they have no respect for all the other people around them? The average person doesn't get up between 5 and 7 am as far as I know. Sometimes I just think that building workers are just stupid and self centered and are just thinking \"I have to finish on time so I have a free afternoon\" - just work like everyone else. I don't have free afternoons either. If they started at 9 and worked to 5 pm, the should not complain, but noooo don't take away their precious afternoons. I am so sick of this. It doesn't make it any better that they stopped working half an hour after I got down and talked to them. They might think \"oh, we are respectful\" but they aren't. I couldn't get back to sleep and I am still so angry that there is no respect whatsoever. Some of you might be building workers: So tell me, why on earth do you start that early in the morning? It's not hot during the day, so it's not for avoiding heat. Do you just love it to wake everyone up?"

I hear arguments against both of their views on women and minorities, or scandals and cover ups and people seem to choose based on which one disgusts them less. However, today i am curious why in the hell No one is talking about their fucking POLICIES!!!! it's like everyone just forgot there is a global entity here that needs to be guided through the undying fuckery that is civilized existence. So if your still reading this, these are my suggestions of things to think about when selecting which shit stain you want to bitch about for the next 4 years. First off, why the hell is everyone talking about Trump's Language and all around douchbaggery as a HUUGE point to discourage his supporters while his policies on economy and foreign affairs make as much sense as sending Louis Black as a hostage negotiator. seriously, anyone that knows anything about how economy works knows that jobs literally cannot come back to a country once they've been outsourced; and cutting taxes on the rich by targeting the poor is like trying to fill your pool by spitting in it. And Hilary, fucking Hilary is a lying sleez, most of us i think can agree on that. Whether it's her scandals or just her face you just hate hate HateHer. But the thing that blows my damn mind is that people see the stories and investigations on the news and think she's any different from any other politician, she's not. Almost ALL of our politicians are bullshit artists/ Criminal scum-bags, saying Hilary for prison is like squashing a single ant in hopes of demoralizing his queen. If we arrested every Criminal politician we would literally have about 3 politicians. Sounds nice right? There is REAL justified concern with Hilary, she has flip-flopped, taken wall-street money all while preaching attacking wall-street, and lacks favor with some foreign leaders. But you don't fix a system by snipping a faulty wire, you must replace what you remove with something that works. So that argument \"I'm voting for Trump because he's not a politician\", is like saying im going to my mechanic to fix my stage 4 colon cancer. and why not, you've tried the doctors and they suck, why not give this mustard stained gentlemen a try, right? that my friends, is how you wake up one day with an alternator in your ass, and ya know where you'll end up? BACK AT THE DAMN DOCTOR! if you want to fix the system you have to start at the faulty parts, and it's neither of these candidates but the system that spawns them. so instead of hating on each other over which turd we think is shinier, maybe just maybe, we could work together and revisit that document we worship that was designed to govern people 200 years in the past for the route of our issues, and with it maybe address some of the issues that ensued by bastardizing that same document to begin with. That's it for this rant, and as always, keep it classy."

They can get better on their own. They can exercise, journal, or draw. They don't need medication.\"\nThe teacher stood their for a moment, staring at her, then said, \"Alright, well this IS an opinion piece....and that IS your opinion....so I guess that's alright.\"\nI raised my fucking hand and said \"Ignorance regarding mental illness.\"\nTeacher asked me to elaborate. The class was looking at me. \n\"There's clearly a lack of education regarding the topic. Mental illness isn't something that someone can choose to have; brains afflicted with mental illness have structural and chemical abnormalities.\" \nThe teacher said that was fine for a topic.\nThe girl then raised her hand, and so did her friend, and the teacher asked if they had a different topic. They both said they wanted to add something regarding this topic, and the teacher said no. \n\nFast forward a week, we've done research on our topics. The girl chose to write about something else. BUT SOME OTHER CHICK CHOSE TO WRITE ABOUT HOW MENTAL ILLNESS ISN'T REAL. \nI was shaking when I presented to my group about my topic. She went right before me. I was shaking because of anger/being anxious about what people would think about the topic. Luckily i have extensive knowledge regarding the topic. \nWhen people asked her to elaborate, she had NOTHING. Absolutely fucking nothing. IT FELT AMAZING. She was just like \"I...i just think that it isn't a real thing.\" \nWe were supposed to bring in 3 primary sources to support our arguments. SHE COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. \n\nI can't stop thinking about it though. I get a shot of adrenaline when I remember her saying it. \nI'm someone who went through two years of in patient residential treatment at a very young age. Fuck, I know that mental illness is real. I know what i'm like when I'm off of my meds. I know what other people I know are like when they're off their meds. \nFUCK \nAnd i talked to the teacher after class, and apparently her young child is going through mental health issues currently!!!! So she's totally with me!!!! "

            "value": "OKAY. When I woke up I was like most ill informed about what was happening in Ferguson. I'm Australian, we don't get much coverage on it. \n\nI only really got into Reddit recently cause my boyfriend showed me, so when the whole Ferguson shit went down, I was getting my information from Tumblr. *that was my biggest mistake.*\n\nToday, I finally researched what the hell happened and made my own opinion. Thank you Reddit. \n\nHowever I am the only out of my friends who have actually researched what the fuck is happening in that town. People are congratulating the people destroying the town. People on that fucking website are calling this a 'Mockingjay' moment from the Hunger Games. Calling Michael Brown a hero. But the fucking kid was an aggravator. The kid attacked a store clerk 10 minutes before Wilson tried to get him to stop j walking in the middle of the street. Then he fucking attacked Wilson. \n\nBUT NO, WILSON ACTED THE WAY HE DID BECAUSE OF PRIVILEGE. \n\nNo. Wilson acted like a cop. He was attacked. He followed his training. Is the training questionable? Probably. Should Wilson be a public enemy like Tumblr and the world is trying to make him? Fucking no. \n\nHe was a good cop. The dude got an award for being a good dude. And let's think about if this was white on white, or black on black, would we of heard about it? No.\n\nWhen I tried to talk to my best friend about it, who is blind sited with the shit Tumblr is posting right now, she told me not to talk to her and to unfollow her if I disagreed. \n\nI showed her this:\nTHE WITNESSES SAY:\n\nWilson drove his car and yelled at Brown to get out of the middle of the road. An assault took place in the car.\n\nSome witnesses say that Wilson pulled Brown into his car. Some say that Brown pulled Wilson out of the car. Somehow, Brown breaks free (or releases Wilson) and runs away.\n\nSome witnesses say that Wilson shot Brown a few times, Brown surrendered with his hands up, and then Wilson continued to fire and kill. Other witnesses say that Wilson told him to stop, Brown charged at Wilson, and then Wilson fired and killed Brown.\n\nTHE EVIDENCE SAYS:\n\nThere definitely is gun shot residue in Wilson\u2019s car. There was definitely a struggle in the car.\nBrown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, with no shots in the back\nPERSONALLY: I\u2019m inclined to believe the cop. The official autopsy (there were 3 that were done) says that the direction of the gunshot wound on Brown\u2019s forearm indicated that Brown\u2019s palms could not have been facing Wilson. Brown\u2019s palms were likely down, not up so it\u2019s less likely he was surrendering with his hands up as testimony said. Forensic pathologist Dr. Judy Melinek said the hand wound was consistent with Brown reaching for the gun at the time he was shot. The gunshot wound to the top of Brown\u2019s head was consistent with Brown either falling forward or being in a lunging position; the shot was instantly fatal.\n\nAlso, when you take into the background of Brown (who hours before just robbed a store as well as had marijuana in his system at the time of death), it\u2019s not hard to believe that Brown could be violent and attack the cop. Especially in a town that hates white cops.\n\nsource: Reddit\n\nAnd tried to tell her that as soon as the evidence went against the witnesses statements, they back tracked it, but she didn't want to hear any of it. No one does. No one cares that this 'Poster Boy' of theirs is in fact a criminal. A low end criminal, but still one. \n\nYeah, of course I agree there is racial profiling in the US. But for fuck sake this is not the case to try and get justice. The evidence is against Brown. Brown is as guilty as all hell. He never had his hands up. He never said 'Don't shoot.'\n\nA town is being burnt to the ground all because of this. See what you have fucking done social media? Are you fucking proud? People's jobs and businesses that are *BLACK OWENED* are burnt to the ground because you want *justice*. \n\nFucking be ashamed you assholes. "

Sure, I don't check these things. Except for 2 hours before 7 she was just sitting on the couch doing nothing. Well why didn't you handle the god damn clothes before 7 then? In fact, why the hell are you telling me what to wear when I have perfectly fine clothing for tomorrow?\n\nMe: \"Well why didn't you say anything when I pulled it out?\"\n\nMom: \"I totally did!\"\n\nMe: Oh, so I just didn't react from when I took it out, unfolded it partially, told you the size which you clearly heard, unfolded it more, put it on one leg at a time, and then pulled up? \n\nMom: No I told you before I gave you the bag!\n\nOh okay. So she told me during that giant tirade about how people were stealing from her and how hard her life is and all that bull. Yea I totally listened to that entire thing.\n\nIn addition, when she mentions events in the past, she likes to add in \"Now I told you here it was a bad idea but you didn't listen\" or \"I specifically said (thing that removes all blame from her)\" or \"I had a feeling this action that somebody else and totally not me did was wrong, but I couldn't say anything because reasons\", so I'm not even sure if she mentioned it and I didn't bother listening or if she didn't at all.\n\nSo apparently she mentioned it once before she told me to try it, and then decided to be completely silent as I pulled out the pair she didn't want me to wear for the entire duration up until they were completely on my body. \n\nFive minutes later, she's till bullshitting about how I'm purposely wasting her time, when suddenly she says this: \"You always blame others for things you do wrong\".\n\nOkay, context: That's something she does. She does stupid bullshit or act rudely, then anywhere from immediately to the next week, she'll suddenly retell the event except this time everyone else did what she did and she couldn't do anything about it because god hates her. This is especially the case when it turns out whatever the fuck she did screwed us over. And claiming that other people do exactly this is something she also does after I called her out on it a few years back.\n\nIt doesn't even make sense in this context. I didn't say she unfolded the shit. So I ask her \"Are you talking about yourself?\"\n\nThen she says I'm purposely saying things to aggravate her and start an argument. Yea, so those five minutes of you insulting me don't count? Okay.\n\nThis is another thing she commonly does. She starts talking to someone about something completely irrelevant or tells them how to do something their perfectly capable of doing, then when they disagree or ignore her she raises her voice at them and insults them, then proceeds to say that everyone she knows really likes arguing with her and making her miserable.\n\nFuck her."

Then I'll shit on him again and again until he learns to live with my shit on him. Now he has to go everywhere with fresh pigeon shit on him, and he will get weird looks, and he'll have to explain for the thousandth time that \"there's a pigeon stalking me, shitting on me everywhere I go. No I'm not crazy.\"\n\nThe video of him getting knocked the fuck out is the best thing I've ever seen. 10/10 would watch this neanderthal get brain damage again.\n\nI know you fuckers are out there, reading this.

Still, the E.R. is for people who have been shot or are suffering a heart attack or fell off their roof and have a piece of copper pipe jammed through their spleen, not people with troubling but not life-threatening skin maladies who have somehow run afoul of some greedy corporate swine who make millions of dollars off of other people's pain and suffering. \n\nI wish this country had some kind of socialized healthcare, like every other fucking first world country on Earth, then I could be seeing a doctor right now, and if it is something sinister, I could be taking an antibiotic.

The only time he spoke to me, was to bum a square or voice that he's hungry. He hasn't showered in like 3 days and he smells off-putting. I told him he can shower whenever he wants, but he refused. He got hungry 8 times a day and depleted my pantry and wallet, again without saying thanks once. He's a longtime friend so I couldn't work up the nerve to tell him straight up. im fed up, because I wasn't expecting an 18 year old to act this way. No job, no school, no manners. He's the same way he was since the last time I saw him (years ago). I want to drive him home but roads are iced over and I have to wait.

Maybe I\u2019ll use some names for the important characters:\n\nMe - Me\n\nGF - My girlfriend\n\nJ - The friend in the group I felt closest too. We\u2019ve known each other for about 2 years and I thought we had really formed a strong friendship.\n\nB - The one that constantly annoys me and (I thought up until this weekend) J. B is cheap, greedy, and will never go out of his way for you unless he can get something out of the situation. He has never actively tried to be a friend to anyone, unless he can cop a free beer or meal off you that day.\n\nAnyway, we all travelled together this weekend and the trip was going decently smooth until the last evening there. We were playing some silly board game, and it was starting to get heated. Eventually B\u2019s team ends up losing, and he GOES OFF for 20 minutes about how it wasn\u2019t his fault, and neither was the previous round where he lost either. He first tried to blame my girlfriend (who was on his team) for \u201cnot being as intellectual as him\u201d, and that was the only reason he lost. Then he said it must have been because me and my GF are dating, so she let me win.\n\nThe whole time, we\u2019re all kinda laughing and play-correcting him, because this is just behavior we expect from B. Of course he won\u2019t accept defeat in a board game, that\u2019s just classic toxic B. But as he goes on, he gets louder and louder, and starts digging deeper with his insults at my GF, saying \u201cthis whole thing came down to one person, and I think we all know who\u201d. And I don\u2019t know I guess I was just fed up, with having to deal with his shit for 2 years mostly, but I started yelling at him. I said that he needed to shut up right now, that he is a poor sport and a shitty person, and that he was behaving like a child.\n\nAnd for some reason, THIS is where J chose to draw the line and start saying \u201cok let\u2019s wrap it up, call it a night\u201d. As if he was fine listening to my and my GF get verbally berated and just deal with B\u2019s general bullshit, but when I started defending myself and GF, and calling B out, that was too far? And that set me off even more. I said that I felt I wasn\u2019t getting the same level of friendship out of our relationships that I put into them. And things like \u201cnice job defusing this situation, you really chose the right person to defend here.\u201d B has never once been a good friend to anyone at work, that I know for a fact. J has come to me several times to complain about B being stingy and a bad friend, so it\u2019s even more upsetting that he didn\u2019t defend me here and even tried to shut me down when I defended myself. \n\nB still kept yelling that he wouldn\u2019t shut up until he wanted to shut up, and \u201cyes I am a sore loser, get over it\u201d.\n\nThe night ended with everyone going to bed in silence and we drove home in silence the next day. Today was the first day back at work, and nobody said a single word to me, but I already overhear J and B talking and laughing again. I\u2019ve always had a distaste for B, because he\u2019s always trying to scheme our hangout for what HE can get out of it for free. But I\u2019m equally as angry at J because I really thought he had my back and I don\u2019t know why he would ditch me like this. And now I\u2019m seriously considering not paying for the group split groceries, gas, and other expenses. I know that\u2019s a shitty thing to do (and something I would probably expect from B honestly). But the trip was actively ruined for me and my GF by two people very purposefully. If they felt it was appropriate to take away our enjoyment like that, then they can feel free to foot our bill too. Plus we already paid for the lodging which was the most expensive part of the trip.\n\nTL;DR: Went in group trip with GF and work friends. One jerk work friend verbally berated me and GF for 20 minutes. I told him to stop and that he was shitty. Other work friend who I thought I was close to decides to shut down my defense. Now I have no friends left at work and don\u2019t want to pay for a terrible weekend."

Yesterday, my husband and I stopped at my mother's house to take down our kids' trampoline, so we could put it up at our new house. It took longer than we expected, and so we were late getting to my aunts house for Easter dinner. \n\nNow, I was prepared to apologize for our lateness, but we had barely gotten through the door before my mother (who had gotten there earlier in the day) and my aunt laid in to me, in front of everyone, my husband and kids included. They began working on a guilt trip, as I was bringing a fruit and veggie tray for before dinner munching, but our timing brought us in fairly close to meal time. Again, I did feel bad about that, and would have apologized, but trying to say I made everyone suffer for the lack, when my family ALWAYS had an excessive amount of pre-meal munchies at EVERY family event, seemed excessive. \n\nYes, I was in the wrong for not leaving from our house earlier. (Though we live about an hour away.) However, other family members have run late for other events for all sorts of reasons, some legitimate, some less so. They have been late enough at times that things have had to be delayed. My one cousin is frequently late, as she has two very young kids, and their naps and such have often caused them to be quite late. No one else has ever been given a verbal beat down. \n\nI honestly wanted to turn right around and leave right then, but my kids had been looking forward to the yearly egg hunt and playing with their cousins and the family dogs. So I decided to take a moment outside to try to clear my head, because honestly I was just short of crying. But, true to form, my mom decides she needs to come out after me, to give a half-assed not-apology, followed by explaining that it happened because I had been so rude and disrespectful, and I KNEW what time things were happening, so why didn't I just plan better.\n\nSomehow, I managed to at least stick up for myself, which I can't usually pull off. Mom finally went back inside, and I hid in our van for a few minutes I forced down my tears before my face was a wreck. I was NOT going to make my kids see me like that. \n\nI went back inside and managed to fake polite for the next 4 hours. My cousins and their husbands acted like nothing happened, like it was just any other family gathering. I forced myself to eat, even though my stomach hurt so much at that point that I half-felt I'd throw up. \n\nIt was such a relief when we could finally leave. Once at home I could vent to my husband out of earshot of the kids, and finally cry out my hurt and frustration. I'd hoped that and a night's sleep would help reset my mood, but I just can't shake it. I wish I could tell them all they're a bunch of hypocritical bitches, and I'm done being the one in the family everyone else feels first email with treating like shit. Anyone else does something, it's all smiles and \"things happen,\" or at the worst, and small shake of the head. \n\nAnyway, I had to vent this SOMEWHERE. I know I'm not completely blameless. But  bitching me out is not OK! We were not late for dinner. The kids had to do the egg hunt after dinner instead of before. This is hardly cause for jumping down my throat when I enter the door. Assholes. "

'involuntarily' celibate? get real. the world is a miserable place. get used to it. and try not shaming people, it'll probably be helpful in the long run.\n\nsincerely,\nsomeone with a penis"

When I first saw them drive up into my driveway a thought to my self \"WTF!!!!!\" They look completely the same! They both have giant ass noses, wide load buts, and same waddle of a walk. A couple days later I found out both of them have some weird bone diseases and Maralee has a hip replacement (she has 2 in both legs now). I found out quickly that Elizabeth isn't a normal teenager. She is obsessed with anime and she reads at a level of a 2nd grader and does math in a lower 4th grade level (shes 14). They visited every weekend sometimes spending the night. Then during January 2013 they moved into our house and it has been hell since then. At first it was okay, but after a while they started hogging and hiding food. Soon it lead to Elizabeth stealing MEN'S deodorant and Axe body wash. This still is going on to this day. Towards the end of May Elizabeth started having things called ticks (a minor form of turrets). She missed the rest of school and eventually she said that she was faking it. Thats the thing, Elizabeth knows how to manipulate her mom into believing almost anything. For example: a while ago Elizabeth fazed a sprained elbow and there is no such thing as a sprained elbow! But her mom believed her. Oh and she is telling her mom that shes having ticks again...WTF! I not being hateful all of this is true. In November of 2013 my Dad told them to leave but the next morning he completely changed his mind. I don't know how Maralee did it but here brainwashing techniques are working because my dad has never been the same since then. These people are ruining my childhood....I wish this never happened. :'(. I just want them out of the house. Please help me somehow."

The white men of my family have gone off to fight in world wars, a Vietnam conflict, and a storm in the desert. A couple of them came back with less flesh than they left with. We have worked tirelessly in low/middle-income jobs. We give to the tax man, we get pulled over by the police, and we get scrutinized if we are someplace that is off our economic radar. I'm the first to graduate college in a line of white men hundreds of years long, but my comfort rests solely in the companionship of blue collar workers. We don't feel like we have had advantages and we are tired of being told we have. I grew up in a white part of America, so we weren't getting over on anyone or suppressing others besides ourselves. The fact is that there is a group of us, increasing in size every day, that is fed up, we aren't the Don Drapers, Ward Cleavers, Harvey Weinsteins, or Donald Trumps that people think we are; we struggle to raise a family, we struggle with mental illness, and we struggle to keep up with the ever-changing society that wants us to adapt to how they think white men should act, neutered. \n\nThe white male is a large population of this country, unfortunately, there are going to be a few that are going to go off the rails. Think of a white man over the age of 50, one that has worked in a factory his whole life after military service and drives an American made car. Now tell me how you think he can relate/understand 23-year-old making millions of dollars playing a game but refuses to stand for the national anthem in a country that offers him his opportunities. Or the white man is in his early 20's, educated, and lonely; he has been told his whole life he can be anything he wants to be, but nothing has worked out. He has lost out on jobs because of hiring quotas or layoffs due to outsourcing. Now he sits at home watching tv and some no talent, no personality, no skill having big butt woman rants on about how terrible her life is as she climbs into her Range Rover as she leaves her multi-million dollar home. What do you think runs through the minds of these individuals when they repeatedly hear themselves being called privileged? These men and the Weinstein/Trumps of America are the ones everyone should be scared of. \n\nMy rant will be dismissed by many, those many that refuse to understand the operating system that white men function under; I understand this.\n\nIt should be known that: I do not own guns, support the 2nd Amendment but do not participate in it; support a woman's right to choose, your body not mine; traveled the world and married a foreign-born woman; served in the military; liberal arts education; and my best friends are men and women of color and of varied sexual orientations.

I had a mental breakdown over the issues, stress, etc. I moved out, lived with someone else for a while and then got a place solo and was doing alright.

            "value": "I just really need to rant and I can pretty much guarantee that I don't have anyone willing to listen at this point.\n\nI HATE doctors. When I was younger I was sick quite a bit and got labelled as a hypochondriac. It turned out my headaches, dizziness, and palpitations were not all in my head... I had Grave's disease. I got treated and then rarely went to doctors. But the label stuck.\n\nI hit college and wanted to do and try everything. I ended up with headaches... and was told it was all stress (tbh it probably was... they never went away, but the meds they put me on worked and once my stress reduced the meds worked even better).\n\nAbout three years ago I started vomiting all the time.... for no reason. I had almost no stress in my life. I was taking a class but the stress was really low from that. I had a job that I loved and was living with my parents to save money (so no rent and almost no bills). The hypochondriac label from my childhood still was stuck in my chart, so when I went to the doctor and told them I had really bad abdominal pain and was vomiting everything I ate I was told to \"wait a month for it to go away\". I asked for something to stop be vomiting and was told to just wait... unsurprisingly I ended up in the ER really dehydrated. They gave me anti-nausea meds (bless them). I went back to my primary care who responded with \"what do you expect me to do?!\"... seriously!? I wanted to figure out what was causing it, but if nothing else to stop the pain and nausea/vomiting. Finally he ordered some tests which all came back normal according to him... they weren't, but that is what he told me. I was currently working as an EMT and thus was around sick people ALL THE TIME... so the fact that my WBC was incredibly low was something I should have been informed about. It wasn't until my primary care was out of the office and I saw a physician assistant that I was informed of this. I told them I was an EMT and actively working and the PA told me I probably should not be working with patients since my WBC were so low. So I take time off and find a different doctor... who doesn't do anything. Finally my WBC goes back up to the normal range and I get back to working (FYI being in the back of an ambulance already feeling like you are going to puke with really bad abdominal pain is horrible! I definitely thought I would puke on a few patients... only threw up in front of one). Finally I beg for a referral to a gastroenterologist who runs the gambit and can't find anything. He suggests surgery. I see a surgeon and sign up without any real idea if they would find anything. At that point the past doctors had convinced me I was just crazy... and I signed up for surgery, which is nuts! I wouldn't have is my mother hadn't convinced me I needed it, if for nothing else than peace of mind. Turned out I had Meckel's diverticulitis... which is incredibly rare. Think of it like an extra appendix (really it is tissue from the stomach that transplanted during development... the acid producing cells then eat through the wall of your intestines slowly... once it is open things can get caught in there (what happened to me) or it can continue to eat away until you hemorrhage (thankfully not me)). So I walked around with essentially appendicitis (in a different form) for a year and a half before it was taken out. I felt instantly better after the surgery... like night and day better. It was amazing! But obviously my chart is still tagged as a hypochondriac.\n\nEnded up getting a job in a lab, move out from my parent's house. Save for a new car. Have a really good year with great friends, my own place, awesome hobbies, and start selling some of my stuff from hobbies. Everything is great!\n\nA year ago I started to get numbness on my right side for no apparent reason. With my history of headaches/migraines I just assumed it was a new form of that, but called my doctors office which sent me straight from work to the ER. ER rules out all the bad stuff and sends me home. Go to doctors office when it continues to get worse and I get worsening dizziness with it. Can no longer drive. Develop a REALLY bad cough... sounded and felt like I was going to cough up a lung. See my primary care... told it is nothing, but given antibiotics. Cough gets worse. Ask for a referral to an allergist. Allergist isn't in the same practice as all the other doctors. Allergist is AMAZING! Actually treats me. Actually believes me. Eventually gets rid of the cough (albeit months later... but at least there are results)! During the fight with the cough I develop abdominal pain. I just assumed it was a result of coughing so much (fairly logical assumption). At this point I have already lost my job (from not being able to work with the dizziness, which is still going on) and have almost no stress in my life (back living with parents) beside not feeling well. Once the cough went away, but the abdominal pain doesn't I know it isn't from coughing like I thought... back to primary care who tells me to just deal with it. ... New primary care. Who agrees to order some tests. All the tests come back normal. So now I am dizzy all the time, getting numbness on the right side of my body, and have pretty much constant abdominal pain. Then I develop diarrhea to the point that I am literally shitting my pants... LITERALLY! I had already scheduled and appointment at Mayo for my dizziness and numbness... ask them to tack on the abdominal pain, diarrhea, and then nausea. They can't find anything. Told they can't give me anything for pain, can't give me anything for the diarrhea, and can't give me anything for nausea... I find out the referral was for headaches?!?... whatever. Come home. Every doctor says that Mayo didn't find anything so nothing can possibly be wrong. Go to a gastro doctor at home to treat possible IBS (the only thing that Mayo came up with)... she won't do anything and literally rolled her eyes at me. Go back to primary care who gives some Norco for pain (to be used sparingly) and something to stop me shitting my pants. Develop vomiting to the point that I can't even keep down water. Finally given something for nausea (after I literally beg). Told there was nothing more they could do... my doctor (who I have only been seeing since this all started) actually said \"you always feel horrible so what is the point in it\". I went home and cried. I was so close to ending it all... I mean what is the point. I can't go anywhere. I can't do anything. I used to enjoy life, have friend, have hobbies... that all go stripped away from me. Only thing that pulled me back was that I couldn't do that to my parents. That after all they have done for me I couldn't repay them with killing myself. ... Ended up in the ER on my birthday and they did nothing, ended up there a couple days later because I couldn't keep anything down. At least then they were able to help me. Went back to my primary care who told me it was all psychological and questioned why I don't have a job right now. When I told him I was dizzy most of the time, couldn't drive, and was having so much diarrhea and vomiting that it made it hard to so anything he just told me I needed to get a job. It was all psychological. Forgot to mention I did in fact go to a psychologist... who told me that there was nothing he could do for me because it didn't sound psychological... sounded physical. So nobody would help me.\n\nI just feel abandoned. I feel alone. I feel crazy. And I feel like I am a burden on everyone. I had a good life once, but it has all gone to shit. Cause I am crazy... cause apparently I want to be sick... cause nobody will believe me. Apparently I wanted to spend all my savings on doctors visits. Apparently I love that I can't go anywhere. Apparently I just don't want to work even though doing nothing drives me insane. Apparently I wanted to lose friends because I can't hang out because I'm embarrassed when I throw up or shit myself in front of them. Apparently this is what I wanted... What is the friggin point?!\n\nIf you made it this far I am honestly impressed... sorry to subject you to such a long post"

The manager was completely uncalled for, and he even held his hand up to silence me when I tried to politely explain (we were super polite because this occurred in front of everyone in the restaurant as we were taking our seats).  Please do not even put your hand up to silence me again.  I am just still in shock that this happened and we were approached with a group of people supporting the manager like we were there to \"rumble\".  I didn't realize Cracker Barrel employed bouncers for the millions of weak old people that visit there each year, since apparently they don't care how these people are treated!  My story:\n\nIt wasn't cool when Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (Ooltewah, TN) kicked my 80-year old grandfather out when he got confused, sat himself at a table, and then when confronted, got heated and even more confused. He shouldn't have been heated (and I'm sure he said some nasty things), but he has DEMENTIA. Since then, my mom has brought him back in that location, smoothed things over, and begged for the \"ban\" to be lifted. So, you can imagine my surprise and humiliation when, as we were being seated, a manager approached us and kicked us out. I tried to explain that he had been in since the \"incident\", but he cut me off and, with multiple people behind him (like we were going to pick a fight), ESCORTED us with his \"bouncers\" to the front to see ourselves out. I am mortified and beyond furious and feel like my grandfather is being discriminated against due to his illness, which is known to cause confusion and aggravation. He's 80 and feeble. He can't punch anyone, he can't flip tables, and he sure can't even remember the incident. You need to learn compassion and respect and get your stories straight. I purposefully chose to take time on my Friday night to eat with my grandfather there, and to be treated with such little dignity, and to watch my grandfather's confusion is sickening and disheartening. I will never eat in another Cracker Barrel again after this disgusting display of ridiculousness.\nIt has been confirmed by numerous family members that my grandfather has eaten at this location since this incident. My mother apologized on his behalf and made sure the staff knew he had dementia and also promised someone would always escort him to the restaurant. I want answers as to why my grandfather was targeted and kicked out!  A friend just told me she called the manager to talk to him (I didn't know she was going to call), and apparently he was a total jerk to her and wouldn't listen to her concern!  I am literally turning into the Hulk right now!"

I have my reasons, I\u2019m not here to rant about them. I literally found a whole subreddit devoted for precisely that. \n\nBut what\u2019s pissing me off more so than usual is that my efforts to see the new Star Wars movie are continuously thwarted. In part by my temporary job with inconsistent hours, making it difficult to commit to scheduling events. In part because of family Christmas traditions that I despise. \n\nAs a die-hard Star Wars fan, I have been working my ass off to avoid any spoilers of any kind. And I\u2019ve been doing a damn good job at it. Until a friend of mine (who also hasn\u2019t seen it) posted that her son came home and told her that one of his friends spoiled something huge. Her post was complaining about people spoiling things, so WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU POST THE ORIGINAL SPOILER IN YOUR GODDAMN POST? I can avoid clickbait headlines no problem, but there was no freaking warning! Months of careful internet precautions thrown into the main reactor of the Death Star!\n\nBut that\u2019s actually not why I\u2019m here. This is all just the precursor. Now you know why I\u2019m already in a bad mood, when my mom called me into the kitchen. As she did so, I muttered \u201cdamn it\u201d (for completely unrelated reasons, I had just accidentally refreshed a rather long gif with text that I wasn\u2019t done reading), and she asked why I was in such a grumpy mood. \n\nNow I\u2019ve been down this road before, hell I live on it, and the only way I can somewhat survive this season is by avoiding fights. All I wanted was to go upstairs and be left alone, I didn\u2019t want to get into my myriad of Star Wars and Christmas related frustrations, so I calmly said \u201cI have my reasons, let\u2019s leave it at that.\u201d\n\nShe acted insulted, and more harshly demanded \u201cwhat\u2019s YOUR problem?\u201d\n\nTo which I replied, slightly more aggressively than before \u201cLETS. LEAVE IT. AT. THAT.\u201d\n\nMom: \u201cWHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201csomeone who\u2019s TRYING to avoid an unnecessary fight but YOU won\u2019t drop it\u201d\n\nMom: \u201cYou NEED to calm down!\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI WAS calm until you kept interrogating me!\u201d\n\nEtc etc, dad intervened semi-uselessly, we finished our business, I went upstairs, and I could overhear mom and dad complaining about me behind my back as I started typing this. \n\nAm I in the wrong here? Am I missing something? Because to my mind, I:\n1. Have every right to be pissed off\n2. Made an honest effort to not let my bad mood ruin anyone else\u2019s night, trying to keep my problems to myself\n3. Am being blamed for escalating the argument that mom provoked by repeatedly disregarding my wish to not discuss the reason for my unhappiness (for the simple reason that discussing the source of said unhappiness is counterproductive towards my goal of erasing the spoiler from my memory).

We all finally recovered and my sister and I turned out great and My transgendered father is living a very successful life, quietly.\n\nNow that I have spilled some deep secrets, I saw what a true transition is and I see what kind of pain and turmoil it can cause.  My father would tell these people go fuck themselves because if they truly felt trans, they would be signed off by real doctors and go under the knife.  They wouldn't prance around on Tumblr saying they are a trigendered fox-kin or whatever the fuck they claim to be.  So those out there that thinks being cis is evil and trans is hip, FUCK YOU!  FUCK FUCK FUCK YOU!"

I'm sure they are nice people and I'm not mad at you and would rather you have a job than not.\n\nHowever, I would love for a higher up to see this post and I wish there was a better way to directly contact them because I sure as fuck would.\n\nI have lived in five separate households that have had Comcast in the past. Unfortunately, the choice is either Comcast, which claims to provide 25mbps or another service like at&t which provides somewhere around 2mbps unless I pay twice as much as Comcast for half the speed. No way in fuck am I doing that either.\n\nI have never ONCE had a good experience with Comcast. I have never ONCE thought \"Oh I'm glad I have Comcast.\" Sure, it's probably a bit faster than the 2mbps att that I could be getting, but for all the bullshit I have experienced, it might be faster. \n\nEvery fucking time I try to use the internet something goes wrong. I either download at LESS THAN 56 FUCKING K, the internet drops in and out or I get ridiculous fucking lag spikes in games. Now I'm somewhat of a tech junkie, but don't claim to know all of the engineering and infrastructure of ISPs, but I sure as fuck expect to get better service than I am (especially now, being close to a large city with hundreds of thousands of people).\n\nIt just boggles my mind that someone high up on the chain in Comcast deliberately lets all of this shit (and other customer service bullshit that I've heard about) go on ''unnoticed''. How bad of a person do you have to be to be okay with providing such a shitty service? It's not like the higher up's haven't heard any complaints about their company and think everything is going well. There's no fucking way that is happening. They are literally face fucking the United States by essentially saying \"Well, you don't have an option, so we don't have to improve our service. Fuck off.'' Makes me fucking sick.\n\n/endrant"

Now, I had nothing to hide, right? But when she saw my downloads and saw the song names, her overly religious side came up. \"What demonic song names are these?!?!?! This is why u are rebellious and u must spend d more time with God\" (im actually not rebellious. She always looks at me and never my sister even though I never rat her out about the hundreds of things she does. But nooo, it's always me. And my sister partially triggered this reaction of my mother) blah blah blah. For the first time,  I told her how her pressuring me of God all the time drives me away from Him. I couldn't take it anymore. She said \"oh, u only say this now cuz u have been caught. These are all lies!! This is what ur garbage music does to u!!!\" And she was yelling this to me at 2 a.m. the songs aren't bad at all. I love soothing House or future house or electro. But the song names were apparently sooo bad that she had to delete EVERY SINGLE ONE. Granted, I had about 300 ish songs. But none of them were bad. and I told her I will delete alot of them and reduce it to less than what it is, tomorrow. I told her to listen to the songs instead of judging them by names. She listed to  one song and even when I proved her wrong, she said \" u have to be careful about the lyrics\" no shit sherlock. I don't like songs that have grange lyrics either. But i dont even listen to the lyrics. I always go straight to the bass and I told her that. I don't even know why she was so mad. It's just a song name. Don't judge books by covers. Don't assume every black person is a criminal.  Don't call a sandwich disgusting if u havent tried it. She is so hypocritical and ignorant. She is also kinda racist even though she is a Christian.  Also she curses. So that's just gr8...luckily, she didn't think about my phone having songs.  Only the tablet. I transfered as many songs as I could from phone to tablet. And now I start from square one. God, like we can never have a 100% relationship cuz of her beliefs. It's always been 70% bond between us. I fear it will stay this way forever due to her ignorance and religious beliefs.\n\nThe song I showed her: https://youtu.be/2_LguMaZTpM\n"

Some people might consider it whining (as it doesn't really seems like the end of the world when put in text), but I don't care. I just want to get it out, so I wont keep smashing my fist again the table. I guess it just comes from hearing my girlfriend all devastated over the phone and there's nothing I can do about.\n\nSo to get started; she is currently in Berlin with her school. She just called me all teared up and sobbing and I asked her what's wrong.\n\nAs it turns out, her entire class has left her on the hotel. Her group of 5-6 girls wanted to go to some museum in the morning, but my girlfriend felt ill and wanted to sleep in. They said that they would come pick her up after they had been at the first museum, so she could come along for the next one in line (which she really wanted to experience).\n\nIt's been 4 hours since they agreed to meet at the hotel. She has tried contacting the whole class but almost nobody picked up their cell phone. The few who did couldn't tell her where they were as they didn't know the streets that well. Bullshit I say! She can't get in contact with her teachers and they have let all the students roam on their own.\n\nSince they have a policy of not leaving the hotel alone, she has been stuck in her room since then. We talked for about 30 minutes and I really tried my best to cheer her up. Luckily they are going home first thing in the morning.\n\nSo it seems like everyone has just frozen her out completely. The calls that she has made, has all (but the teacher's) been declined on the phone (you can hear a click when the person you're calling is declining the call).\n\nI told her that I'd like the phone numbers of everyone and I'd call them. I don't know how that would help as she also said; that would only make it worse...\n\nFor gods sake, they're all adults. My girlfriend is normally a very social person and kind to be around, which just makes this whole thing really confusing.\n\nMy girlfriend doesn't speak german, but she has decided to take a tour on her own. I told her, go for it as long as she stays near the hotel and don't get lost.\n\nIt's just really frustrating because not only are she missing all the tours and stuff that they were going to see, but we also had quiet a bit of trouble paying for the trip. It's obligatory and self-paid entirely, however a mistake with some papers has lost us a lot of income in the last two months and we had to loan from friends and family to pay our rent. Despite our young age, we normally live quite comfortably with a budget of what's equivalent to 2k USD per month after rent, insurance and misc. bills. That's great and all, but this trip has fucking ruined us for the next couple of months. It isn't bad but when the trip turned out to be so crappy and lonely for my girlfriend, it really pisses me off that those people would do that.\n\nWhen I'm going to pick her up at the train station tomorrow, I just hope that I wont see those people nor the teachers any near me. God, it pisses me off!\n\n**TL;DR**: GF and I spent a lot of money on a obligatory school trip for her. Class mates ignores her and leaves her to be stuck on the hotel. I can't do anything about it.\n\n"

She did not recollect that, but did make an announcement after EMPLOYEE_A's wife had their child.  HR_LADY then suggested I tell everyone at the Managers Meeting, which I thought was a good idea.  I left her office and was planning on telling all the managers next week at our managers meeting.\n\n\n\nToday, F_EMPLOYEE_B came in to my office to congratulate me on hearing \"good news\".

She told me that HR_LADY told her, and then thought that HR_LADY might have told her in confidence and to not tell anyone else.

It's a petty thing, I know, but these things build up over time.) \nAnyway, what I'm trying to express to them is that they're bothering me by doing this. The other roommates aren't even picking on me in a way that's funny or witty, they're just picking on me to pick on me. For instance, I'll ask them a simple question such as \"what are you guys watching\" and they'll scold me for asking the question instead of answering it. Their behavior has become extremely condescending that I no longer wish to spend time with them anymore. \nThe problem is, I know they're not doing this to be mean. Every time they pick on me, they get a laugh out of everyone else, so I'm pretty sure that they're doing this in an attempt to be funny. They just assume I don't mind because I have never, *ever* lost my temper or lashed back. \nI simply want to tell them how much they are bothering me, but I'm not sure how to put it in words. How do I tell them that sometimes they go too far with their teasing? Last time I complained, they said I was asking for it because I never stand up for myself. I'm afraid I'll get into an argument, but I'm not very good at expressing myself and I just end up stumbling over my words and sounding extremely illogical. Any ideas on how I can express myself more clearly? "

That post was swiftly removed. Now I'm pissed. \n\nHere is what I said on askreddit.\n\nI am not one to post very much on Reddit, but I browse the site nearly every day. I am keenly aware of the sarcasm in most of what people post on Reddit, particularly when it comes to \"hating\" certain groups of people. I get all that. My friends and I (many of whom, including myself are Jewish) play cards against humanity regularly and make plenty of offensive jokes. \n\nWhat I don't get is why the central administration of reddit thinks some hate, as parodic in nature as it is or is not, is more sufficient reason for banning a subreddit than other. I fully support banning subs that participate in illegal/immoral activities (sharing CP on jailbait subs, people's private pictures on fappening subs, etc.). The admins of reddit are using their powers for good when they ban subs like these. They're also doing good when they ban offensive subs like /r/fatpeoplehate as they did tonight. \n\nYet, they leave /r/gasthekikes unbanned and allowed to exist as actively as it ever has. Hate is hate, regardless of whether it is about race (in the case of /r/gasthekikes) or physical appearance (in the case of /r/fatpeoplehate), and it is frankly disgusting on the part of the admins of reddit that they have not come down with a clear ruling on how these types of subs should be handled. \n\nTonight, /r/fatpeoplehate was banned for violating the reddit site rule to \"keep everyone safe\". Good call on the part of the moderators. Later, /r/obesepeopledislike was banned for ban evasion. Fine. Subs that appear hateful in nature should be banned regardless of the help that they have given to some people, as some users of the site would argue. Yet, /r/gasthekikes is allowed to exist. Why? This sub, no matter how \"parodic in nature\" its \"calls to violence\" may be, it exists for the sole purpose of hate speech toward Jews. It prominently features cartoons of stereotypes of Jews, images of Swastikas, the phrase \"race war now\" to incite a \"parodic\" race war... even the name of the sub itself features a derogatory term for Jews. This is a disgrace to reddit and I am ashamed to be a part of any website that could allow this to exist.\n\nA much  less overt in its hate exists about black people called [the Chimpire](http://www.reddit.com/user/Jewish_NeoCon2/m/chimpire), though this is a much smaller community consisting of many subreddits as opposed to one main one.\n\nI do not believe that reddit should ban any sub that offends any single person. We can clearly see what happens when political correctness goes too far by looking at any of the posts on /r/tumblrinaction.\n\nI would like to note that my intention is NOT to defame the administration of reddit or the site as a whole. As I previously stated, I actively browse this site on a daily basis and truly believe in its power as a force for good. Nor is my intention to use this as my soapbox and preach about the wrongdoings of this site. I am honestly and genuinely looking for answers as to why this is allowed to happen.\n\nTL;DR - Hate should be treated the same in all instances, not treated on a case-by-case basis, particularly when the magnitude of the hate is as it is on /r/gasthekikes."

So it'd be really awkward for me to ask him to stop texting me and then us both show up to our friends place or something. You know? Idk. Should I just continue to ignore him until he stops texting me? Which I have done in the past... But it's always awkward when we see each other and he's like \"you never texted me back.\" \nAny suggestions? Should I confront him about it or just ignore him? \nI know he thinks of me more than a friend. He's told me that in the past. Also he has a girlfriend."

You.\n\nIn fact, I'll go so far as to say fuck you to anything that has no logical system, and which encourages the idiotic general public to just stream in, every man for themselves.\n\nHere's some context about why I am so fucking infuriated. Recent airport visit, and I am taking the long-term car park shuttle bus back out of the airport. Myself and my father put our bags up in the racks and sit down to wait for when our stop comes around.\n\nDuring this time, people going to the airport start getting on each time the bus stops. You would think some logic would prevail and they would first go around and unload all the people who are getting OFF, before accepting people who are getting ON. But no.\n\nSo our bags get buried under a mountain of other people's bags in under a minute.\n\nOur stop comes around, so we get up to leave. I manage to weave my way around the sheeple who stand around in the way refusing to move (god forbid they sit in an empty seat next to a stranger), dig my bags out from under the mountain, and take them out the rear exit to set them down out there.\n\nAt which point I notice my father is having trouble getting his bag, so I get back on the bus thinking helping him will be quick, right? Wrong.\n\nAt this same stop, the sheeple have started piling in like fucking lemmings, swarming around us even though it is quite clear we are trying to get a bag out. A woman with a pusher parks her ass right next to us, and her suitcase goes on top of the pile AS MY FATHER IS TRYING TO LIFT HIS SUITCASE! LITERALLY!\n\nAnd the bus driver? Fuck you, bus driver. You are the catalyst for all this bullshit you call a 'system'. He just sits there, when it would be quite easy to say 'let these people get off before you start getting on'. Instead he does nothing, just encouraging the utter chaos. He is that oblivious to what is going on that he starts DRIVING OFF before we have got the bag.\n\nEventually I snap. I tell the lady to 'Get the fuck out of the way', because 'Can't you see we're trying to get out of here?'\n\nOh, now the driver notices. He backs the bus over to the platform, realising I have to get off. Gets up, puts his hand on my shoulder as if telling me I have to get off. I tell him not to touch me, and that we are trying to get this bag. So he finally does his job, creates some order and helps my father get his bag so we can get off the bus.\n\nSo yeah, fuck you to the clueless general public who act like it's do or die and pile on in. This not only applies to this situation, but any. Hell, look at the subway. Signs everywhere telling you to wait until others get off, but still you horde around the doorways. Get the fuck out of the way.\n\nAnd fuck you bus driver for not giving a shit. And especially fuck you to whoever designed these stupid buses that despite being full sized like a regular public transport vehicle, have no room for people with pushers, a pissy little rack (when the whole expectation at airports is people come with huge bags).\n\nIf you're curious where this happened, Australia. I don't mean to talk my country down, but at least abroad in a place like the United States, the driver TELLS people to cut shit like this out. That was all this prick had to do. Instead he didn't even realise we were getting off, that is how oblivious.\n\nI'm probably irrational over the whole situation, and probably bias because I have hated the general public for a while (who wouldn't after working retail?). But screw it, thanks for listening."

She then shoots me down claiming that it's something that's causing it, and then proceeds feeding the fire with it. \n\nIn that instance, there was immediate friction between the two of us. No one jumped into the conversation to back me up. \nLadies and gentlemen, you add sage brush, leafs, or anything of the sorts to a fire then it's going to create smoke and ash. Just saying. I hate it when people think they're right. "

On Wednesday last week he had to leave the job site to get his medicine that he left by accident. We are talking about the stuff he MUST HAVE AT ALL TIMES TO AVOID PASSING OUT AND GOING INTO A COMA!!!!! They fired him because they said since he left to do that, he was stealing hours from them. They also deny him his vacation pay and told him it's not their problem he is sick, he is costing the company money and he is not welcome on their property any more. I don't understand how they could treat him like this after 10 years and he was always their best worker. He literally won company awards at the beginning of the year for it. I know it's because the owners new husband of two years has never liked him. I'm so pissed. We have two small children. I just needed to vent. I'm hurting for him, he was almost in tears with how they treated him."

Now that I'm completely broke, although barely less than what you paid me (especially with the workload I had), I had to pay what little money I had left to get internet so I can find another job! \n\nYou set everything up for me to fail and not give a fuck about what I do, so you're screwing yourself over too by not even allowing me to send that last email or finish the last report. You didn't even ask for progress of what I was doing, so have fun figuring out what work I was doing and how to finish it, especially when doing any work at all meant transfering documents onto a USB and doing work home, beacuse again you have never allowed me to do work at work or have internet at home to send and receive it.\n\nThe last two days since you fired me have been the most relaxing ones in years. The upcoming stress will not be on finding a new job or having money for food, it will be the agony of having to hold back cussing you out in interviews when I have to explain why I no longer work there.\n\nI can't wait to find a place to work where petty shit irrelevant to the workplace is put above actual doing work, having immature little shits gossip and make fun of myself or other workers there for how I walk because of my back issues that is severely limiting my ability to use my legs (on top of being in constant pain), not having sufficient pay or insurance (let alone a direct billing option when pay is limited and I can't wait to be reimbursed) to do anything about it, openly stating that there's a black mold problem in the office that I heard months later is still there which I know contributed to my random constant nosebleeds in the few months after I started working there and the fact that my head hasn't worked properly in years and that I've been on medication for anemia for two years (took months before that to get the diagnosis because I was spending all my time inside and outside that office either doing work for there or stressing about it), and having what I thought would be an awesome and fun thing of allowing dogs in the office end up being people fucking around the entire day screaming and the dogs barking constantly because of their shit owners (that can't even rationalize that bringing a dog that does bark into an office may be a bad idea, but why would that matter to anyone there, especially the executives). And, prick that kept asking me to bring my dog in and harassing me about yet another petty, irrelevant thing rather than my work - the past 6+ times I've said no fucking mean something.\n\nI was looking for work within months of starting there, but your inability to give me any time or resources inside or outside of work did not make that possible. No shit my work performance degraded, I was losing my mind and told that my work was not the priority, then give me no way out. You beat me to it, but I was desperate to get out either way and I will take the stress of finding a job, being broke, dealing with welfare and sacrificing all my documents on my work computer over being there another day.\n\nI have no one in my life to offer financial or emotional support because you completely drained an already strained social and family life, but this is a step in the right direction.\n\nThe last two days have been the most productive in years in any aspect of my life - I've completely cleaned my apartment, got internet (yay!), filed for welfare, sent two applications and drafted three more to be sent soon, opened about a dozen more to apply for, and spent the most time playing, walking and sitting in the park with my dog in months.\n\nI have no more need to suck up and bow down to you anymore, so go to hell!\n"

She sent me a PDF of the different plans, including the Plan ID numbers. Unfortunately, this information only included the basic coverage, not which medications were covered specifically.\n\nNow, going into this, I have a *long* history with dealing with health insurance companies with my illness, enough that I could write two dozen posts in here on it. But, I'm assuming you, the reader, don't know about how bad health insurance companies are. I'm assuming you're thinking, \"That's easy, dude. Just call them and ask if the medication is covered, right?\" You'd think that, wouldn't you? But you don't know about the bureaucratic clusterfuck that is the American Healthcare system.\n\nHIC = Health Insurance Company\n\nMYE = My wife's employer, where she is starting in 2 weeks\n\nMOP = Mail-order pharmacy, a place where health insurance companies have certain medication shipped from that can't be filled in normal pharmacies\n\nSP = Specialty Pharmacy, a super special place for extra special extra expensive medications are shipped from\n\nThis started around 11am. I contacted HIC. I explained that my wife was starting in a few weeks at MYE. The person asked for the company name. I tell her. She says that she can't find the company in the system. This is a company, remind you, that employs over ten thousand people. I provide her with the specific plan ID number included in the PDF. She can't find that either. She says I need to contact MYE's benefits department for the coverage information. \n\n11:30am -- I contacted MYE's benefits department. After explaining the situation to them, they told me that HIC should have the information, because they've been sending them the information for a year.\n\n11:39am -- Called back HIC. This time, the person was miraculously able to find MYE. She put me on hold while she looked into it. She came back to say that the medication was offered by MOP, and that I would have to contact them. I told them that my fear was that without any member ID information, since my wife wasn't an employee, we wouldn't be able to find anything. She put me on hold while she called them to ask about my specific medication. After around 15 minutes, she returned to say they believe it would go under the deductible, but when I asked clarifying questions about coverage she wasn't sure. I asked to be transferred to MOP to get more information. \n\n11:48am -- I explain the situation to the person at MOP. They can't bring up the information for MYE. Specifically, they can't bring up prescription information, only basic plan info (the same stuff I have in front of me). I ask why, and they say that without a member ID, they don't have any way to bring up the information. I tell them I feel like I'm in a Catch-22 situation. I need to find out if a specific medication is covered before I buy into a health insurance plan, but I'm unable to find out if a specific medication is covered until I buy into a health insurance plan. Once I'm in the plan, I can't get out without a qualifying life event. She agrees that it's like that. She says that if she had a \"Universal ID code\" from MYE, that would help her be able to find any information. She doesn't have that information because \"It hasn't been submitted by MYE.\" I told her I had just spoken to them a half hour ago, and they had assured me they had submitted all relevant information to health insurance companies. She contacted a supervisor, and they work with me on hold for a little while, and then come back to confirm they can't find any information without that. When I provide her more information about my medication, she realizes that it's considered a \"medical procedure\" because it's delivered via infusion. She tells me that I need to contact HIC to get coverage questions about that. I assure her that they're going to send me straight back to her if I contact them again. I also tell her that my *current* provider ships medications through a mail order pharmacy, so I assume it works the same way here. She offers then to transfer me to SP, because they might have better information.\n\n12:20pm -- Speaking with a rep at SP, and relaying the tale so far. They run into the same problem, where they can't bring up the information without a universal ID code. I ask her what I need to tell to MYE when call them to get that information, and she says that telling them they need a universal ID code will be sufficient and they will know what I'm talking about.\n\n12:45pm -- Contact MYE benefits department. I explain the entire situation, and I say I need a universal ID code to look up individual plan coverage. The person has no idea what I am talking about. The best they can give me is a group number for MYE.\n\n12:58pm -- I call back SP. The person kept on trying to see if I or my wife were in the system, despite me assuring her that we wouldn't be because she doesn't have coverage yet. I provided her with the group number, but it doesn't help. She tells me she will contact MOP to see if they can use the group number. She places me on hold.\n\n1:07pm -- I find myself suddenly hearing ringing in my hear. I've been inexplicably transferred somewhere. \"Hello, this is MOP. Can I have your member ID number?\" The person at SP had just transferred me without warning. I try to explain the situation. The person says they can't do anything if I'm not a member. I ask if they can find any information about plans, and they say yes, if I was a member they could punch it in and it would pop up. I ask them why they can't do it without a member ID number, and they say they just can't.\n\nI hang up and scream."

Someone who everyone else has ghosted because their life is better without him. He isn't a terrible person deep inside, but he apparently has no respect for my time or money. I will go thru some low lights of our friendship, and, I'm sure by the end you'll tell me it's partially my own fault for not just ghosting him too. And, you'd probably be right since everyone else in my life agrees. Met this kid in middle school, but, he's always been a spoiled, entitled kid. We're nearing 40 now, for some quick background. He's one of those people who feels it's perfectly okay to agree to something when he has no intention of following thru on his word. Back when were like 20, and I have literally 6$ to my name -  we're in a CD store perusing the rap CDs. He is short a few bucks for buying a Mystikal CD, and says he will pay me back tomorrow. I give him what I have, I am now flat broke. The next we're in a dunkin donuts drive-in, he is ordering a coffee/donut, and I am starving. I tell him to order me (I don't remember what exactly) and just to please cover it with the 6$ I'm owed. His response \"Nahhhhh. I can't\"  Yes, he decided that despite having plenty of money it was completely okay to change his mind about paying me, and now I have to watch him eat. Nice guy. Other things include telling me he'd be leaving in \"just a few minutes\" to pick me up, and I'd sit there, on a beautiful Saturday for a couple hours before he finally shows up, completely wasting a good chunk of my afternoon. This happened so many times I can't even type this without becoming angry at myself for being too nice. Other behaviors included the time he asked if he could buy a guitar I had, but no longer played. First, he haggles me on the price, and, once we finally agree to one, I hand over the guitar, plus stand and case with the understanding that he promise to pay in full the following week. I agree because I am now very financially secure, and it's not a huge deal. Or, so I thought. He had plenty of money to buy every upgrade / accessory for my guitar, and a super expensive AMP, but when I came to collect, he decided he could only give me 20$ (despite me seeing a wallet full of cash). He essentially changed it into a 20$ installment program, which is a giant waste of my time and resources. As far as I'm concerned, he defrauded me and conned me out of my property! Another classic example is when I was a frequent passenger in his car, and, we were coming back from a trip or party or something. We literally drive right past my exit (my 'rents lived ~3 minutes from the said exit) and I ask why he drove right past anyways. He said he \"wasn't ready to take me home yet\" and we head back to his house, which is a good 15-20 minutes away. He asks me to wait in the car while he showers quickly inside. I say sure and he is gone for at least an hour, leaving me sitting there. When he returns to the car, I press him for the hour he left me there and he seems oblivious to how long he had left me there.  And, I could've been home already as he could've easily dropped me off when it was even more convenient. So, why I am writing this now? Well, I stupidly agreed (after not seeing for a long time) to come see his new condo. I am much much happier without him in my life, as he brings me down, and still hasn't changed much since we were kids. He's called me sobbing or crying about his lack of friends, but I can't really look past how he treats me and other people, thinking our time and money are for him to manipulate and dispose of as he sees fit. And, again, everyone else is done with him, happily. Anyways, I head down, which the understanding that we were going to go grab dinner after he takes his dog to his 5pm vet's appointment. In fact, we discuss restaurants numerous times throughout the afternoon, so I think it's a done deal. But, It's rapidly approaching 5pm, and, knowing the vet is 15 minutes away, and, there's going to be rush hour traffic -I ask if we're going to head out shortly, and what restaurants are close to the appointment. He gets up, and we start the car. He gets a text from his girlfriend, and, leaves me in the car for 5-7 minutes, engine running while he goes inside again to talk to her. Finally, he comes shuffling out, and announces that he's not going to the appointment (we would've been easily 40 minutes late by this point). So, I ask him if he just wants to grab some food, to which he replies he's not hungry, doesn't have money for eating out, and also has no gas (tank was definitely on empty). So, instead of just fessing up, he bullshits me repeatedly, strings me along, then \"realizes\" he doesn't have gas or restaurant money. Oh, and the 10$ tool I picked up for him? He no longer wants/needs it, so I will likely end up returning it.  Honestly, I was annoyed, but also relieved that our evening came to sudden and abrupt end, and, once I got back on the highway I felt good that I was out of his shitty neighborhood, and I had fulfilled by requirement. No surprise here, but I was the only person other than his own mother who has seen his new pad. I guess nobody else cares. And, I think I've had enough of this kid.  Thanks for reading.\n\nTL; DR: I have a douche for a long-time friend that I should've ghosted years ago for constantly wasting my time and money. "

It's our \"snow vehicle\" and vehicle for hauling heavy big crap that won't fit in a little coupe.\n\nBut this whole shitstorm started with....\n\n....well, let's put it this way, what would you think if some random rich guy offered to buy you a new car because you've been with his kid in a relationship for only six months?  Would you take up the offer? or Would you refuse?\n\nLet me tell you what a smart person would do, they would REFUSE.  I'm not going to take a huge sum of money from a stranger I hardly know at that point - that was years ago.  How do I know this guy was not going to sue me if me and his daughter broke up and then take my only source of transportation away!?!?  C'mon, I may be poor, but I'm not a fucking idiot!  \n\nI've worked in industries where the rich and poor mix, in those industries, getting fucked over by the rich is the norm because \"nothing is free\" - I know this, so therefore, I'm not going to take an offer on a major lifetime purchase just because some random guy I hardly know at the time offers.  How do I know I'm not getting screwed - now I know that's not very likely now - but we've known each other years.\n\nBut fucking hell - if my car is not the achilles heel of this bloody relationship.  It's not even the primary vehicle anymore and STILL i'm getting shit for owning a very old vehicle.\n\nThe #1 concern on THEIR side is safety.  Let me tell you something, 90's vehicles are not that much different than what is out now.  Actually, older vehicles were BETTER without all that extra shit to break, and you did not have 3000 distractions everywhere like DVD players, bluetooth, navigation systems that can't understand verbal input properly, and other crap.  You were expected to KNOW how to drive a vechile properly.  And as a nearing middle-aged man with NO Accidents, 2 tickets over a decade in my past, and maybe a fender bender or two very early on - it's can be well assumed I'll be a fucking safe driver even if I was in a Model T dropping oil slicks everywhere.\n\nThey think I'm being \"Stubborn\" because I know what I want and what will fill my needs, rather than settling for a car that I don't like so much.  I've been researching a new car for over FIVE years - the two vehicles I've been looking at have been out of production for years now, and I could buy a reliable used one for a decent price - but nooo, they are \"too old\" - fuck that shit, a car is not judged by it's years - it's BETTER judged by online reviews by people who OWNED said vehicle, and it's better judged by a CARFAX report!\n\nAlso, I know how to fix cars.  One reason my car is so old, is I can fix most things that go wrong with it.  But at this point, it's like every other fucking week it's another problem.  It's telling me \"it's time\" - but I don't have a down payment yet, and I'm not going in just all willy nilly to some shady fucking dealership and letting some shifty eyed fuckhead called a \"Dealer\" fuck me up the butt because I want to impulsively buy a new vehicle - I'm using TACT, and PAITIENCE - two things that seems to be in short supply for most (stupid) people these days.\n\nLook, at this point I know them well and that they mean well, so fine, yeah, finance my fucking car if it's so important to you.  Otherwise, leave me the hell alone!  I know what I want, I know what to pay, I know how low I can negotiate!  I've done more than enough research on the subject though I might do a refresher before I pull the goddamn trigger!  I don't want some Fru Fru piece of shit because automatically a peace symbol missing one line means \"safety\" - it does not.  \n\nI'm not buying something that TAKES AWAY what I want in a vehicle - to me a \"New\" (to me at least) vehicle means UPGRADING!  IT should take what was best about your old vehicle - and UPGRADE it!\n\nNot to mention, I want a house more than a car at this point, but of course, everyone is like \"why do you still have that old piece of shit?\" why is it any of your business.  IT's called family politics interfering with what I want to buy because OTHER People think they are more sound of mind than I am despite me having done the actual fucking research.\n\nWhat pushed me past this point though fucking goes beyond just cars and acquaintance levels - it comes from the fact that the whining parties are the ones who won't even confront me, they are so scared, so pussified, they won't fucking come to ME about my vehicle - they have to go through someone else in the bloody family to talk to me about it, and then when confronted by me, they get cold feet.\n\nLook, I know what I want, I know how much to pay, I know to negotiate PRICE over payment cost to get a better deal. I've been reasearching every nasty trick in the book dealerships will pull on you to fuck you over.  I've read over 500+ reviews of the vehicles I've looked at.  \n\nThere may be a 3rd choice that fits what I want but the problem it lacks a major feature I Need for my particular needs with regards to cargo space.\n\nI don't want a 80's F-350 sized \"compact\" truck, I don't want a bloated version of the truck I already have, I don't want a CUV, I want somethign truck based, that handles snow, can get dirty and stiill be acceptable, maybe even preferred to, and that I don't have to be uber paranoid about dents, dings, scratches, and life.  I'm PRACTICAL! To me, a car is NOT A status symbol - it's a way to get from  point A to point B period, and get your SHIT from point A to point B - and if I have to undermine everyone to get what I know I require - I WILL!\n\nCan we just drop the fucking talk about my \"old piece of junk\" and move on.  I'm sick of it, it's been years now!  Yeah, I know, it's 25 year old, has 300K+ on it, interior parts are wearing out, and so on - oh, and all that bad press in the 90's was just media sensationalism!  FUCK OFF.  IF you want me to buy a new car - be helpful or just go the fuck away.\n\n"

And then die in my bed in my 50's-90's, totally under the radar.\n\nWell, looks like that's not fucking happening, so-called \"monetary mismanagement\" and the idiot suits and ties up top at my wife's job apparently seem to want to lay her off because she's the last person hired - this is the umpteenth time this has happened - why don't they fire the bitch that's always absent and has been for six and a half years.  I find this lackluster bullshit politics in our working world so shitty that if I could have the faith that I could start a revolution by getting a disturbingly high chunk of humanity to quit their jobs tomorrow, and shut the whole system down for long enough to bring on a great positive change, I fucking would!  But nope, now I'm going to have to be the breadwinner again, making budget cuts to meet our new \"within our means\" and doing a bunch of extra shit, all the while taking it up the ass from my job where the lazy succeed and the great fail as well.  Thank god I stopped caring awhile ago, that's probably why I still have a job!\n\nWe are not free, we are all reliant serfs to a kingdom made up of Corporate Suits and Politicians who run everything - it's a big boys club none of us normal people are in.  We are not free, we are slaves, slaves to the machine.  They don't give a shit if you raise the bar, or save them tons of money, or make worthwhile, educated suggestions to improve business - they only care about the bottom line, and that requires subservient sheep as the gasoline to keep the engine of business flowing, and I'm damn well sick of it.  If you stand out in any way, you are crushed like a bug - it's seen to that you are brushed away like a fly, a flea, and it's done in a very underground way so as not to raise suspicion by the other sheep who may be more observant and intelligent! WAKE THE FUCK UP!!!\n\nYou go to school for 12 years to learn to be a good little distracted sheep who blindly follows orders with only just enough understanding to run the machinery to get the job done.  Then if you want more money, with no guarantee that will actually happen - you front thousands in student debt to go to some brainwash internment camp called a college where they make it sound like you study and work hard, but where all I've seen is you sleep in class, party, fuck, and do the same shit I did in my 20's for free while I actually learned stuff on my own time!  I come from a family of college educated people, I'm doing EXACTLY the same as well as them - what's the fucking point?\n\nAnd if \"majors\" are so important, then why are so many bullshit majors with no real purpose?  I know, to suck more money from you, because if you study something like \"Women's Studies\" or \"Journalism\"  or \"Music\" - what kind of fucking job are you going to find?  Probably sitting at a desk a secretary somewhere!\n\nLet's see, what's the point in college and high school graduate when a GED holding guy with \"Equivalent\" experience is making the same amount as a National Merit Scholar Doctor and can't even afford a fucking house because his field requires being in an URBAN area where house prices are being driven up and communal living is a thing.  Fuck that shit!\n\nA few years ago, I had a friend who believed in the New World Order - I honestly know it has to be what's happening to us.  Makes sense - the communal living, the lack of reward for extended effort, treating your employees as a number rather than as a valued contributor, being judgy assholes to your neighbor - hell, the fuck we have a 90's Rehash and a Orange Faced Oompa Loompa with no qualification running for president should be sign enough.  Enough of the shit show.\n\nDue to work, life, and politics today, I'm convinced the best thing we can do as human beings, is just nuke the entire planet, and end ourselves!  Rid the planet of this virus called the human race once and for all!  Reset Button! Game Over! We lost!  Time to let mother nature reformat and reinstall earth!  "

I was happy for him, the poor dudes been lonely for so long it was about time he found someone to make me happy. I did not know Caitlin was 14 at the time.\n\nSince I was now officially in on their secret relationship, they kept me informed. Adam was the one who told me she was 14. Immediately I was uncomfortable. They've been in their online relationship for almost 3 months by then. I told him it was pretty gross and that I think he shouldn't be with her anymore because SHE IS A CHILD FOR PETE'S SAKE. But all I got was, \"Well I'm waiting until she is 18 to do anything.\" A load of bullshit that was.\n\nApparently someone reported him as a child predator on an online site made for that and cops showed up at his doorstep. It was then illegal for him to talk to anyone under 18. They both turned on me because it couldn't have been Adam's friends that knew could it? \n\nFast forward a year later, Caitlin messages me saying how much I ruined her life and that when she turns 16 she'll be able to talk to him again. True love yada yada. Tells me to go to hell. WTF. FIRST OF ALL YOUR RELATIONSHIP WAS DISGUSTING. SECOND OF ALL, IT WASN'T ME THAT REPORTED HIM, and third of all the cops wouldn't have fucking showed up at his doorstep if they weren't doing anything incriminating on skype. Like damn.

FALSE. i'm a fucking person, not a product you buy in a bottle at the local CVS and throw away when it's empty. you are an ass and will remain an ass and no woman, no person, could ever possibly fix that for you except your mother and father, and let's be real here it's a tad late for that.. and if this is how they raised you, they should be ashamed for being complete failures. your shitty attitude and piss poor outlook is so deeply ingrained you'll never see the sun again because your head is lodged so firmly up your pimply ass. i cannot wait until you are out of my life for good, and you find the magical rainbow cookie fairy woman that shits rainbows and unicorns into your mouth and has an endless milky spring of happiness and sunshine that flows from her sparkly abundant bosom that is always there for you and convenient and makes your life oh-so-peachy perfect and just fucking terrific. fuck you, i wish i were dead when i see you and so i didn't have to listen to your mindless cruel small-minded drivel every day."

            "value": "This involves a long story about last night and jesus christ fuck my asshole im annoyed about it among other emotions!\n\nIm from Scotland and I live with my girlfriend. Below us is a party flat, it NEVER fucking ends. Im 25 and shes 27 and the guys downstairs are late 20's. This flat has like an open house rule, one dude owns it and all his friends just take complete and utter advantage. I sort of feel sorry for the guy, but after last night have decided he's just as retarded as his mates.\n\nSo, I was in the middle of attempting to show my girl that Punisher short film \"Dirty Laundry\" when the buzzer goes. This often happens on the weekends as the party never ends, as stated before, so she answers it and lets the person in to the stair. That person was the owner of that flat (im fairly sure hes after my gf but ive met him once before and he seems nice so im nice), he was fucked out his face. He had been drinking since like 2, its now midnight, he had been taking a number of different things that only aided to his natural born retardedness. He could talk, he seems simple anyway so he didnt sound that different but after about 45 mins he just started all over again, forgetting he'd been telling the stories.\n\nAfter about an hour, it was obviously getting awkward, she'd mentioned a few times that she had to be up for 7 and id mentioned that I had to be up for a lesson.\n\nI went to make some tea and he told my lady that he'd go grab some weed. fantastic, we were going to get some sort of payment for putting up with him :)\n\nHe returned 2 minutes later with another drunk. This guy was a total baffoon, he was bounding around, rolling about and generally loud as fuck, but he was also very funny and we had a great laugh as he got caught up in our phone line like a tangled fish. He was a big rugby playing forward looking type ( for you yanks, thats the fat ones) and had a glorious chuckle.\n\nIt was fun, I was having fun, he was now the new guy who was funny, we were laughing, the owner of the flat was adding the occasional bit of wit into the mix and all was good.\n\nBut it started to turn bad. The rugby guy started saying some compliments to my girlfriend which was expected as she is hot as fuck, but the time between comments bacame shorter and shorter and I started to get pissed off. He then went to touch her hips from behind and I said to him \"dont do that, we are good now but if you touch her again we're gonna have a bad time\". His mate was loving the fucking macho-ness of it all and was telling me to punch him.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later I wne to make some tea and came back and as I came back he went and sat next to her, he started going to touch her again and i put my hand on his face and told him again. His mate once again singing for me to punch him. We all decided after that that he should leave and he started leaving, his mate singing still and me just wanting the guy to leave my house, he was not being threatening to me and im not the sort of person to sucker punch anyone.\n\nHe then turned and said something sleazy to her whilst walking back towards her with his hands raised toward her going in to test more boundaries! I got in his way and started to grab him, I thought this was going to be one of those, grab em and drag em things like in the movies but this guy was... a... rock! He didnt even move back an inch, instead, with him barely moving, his gravity or something pushed me back and he went back down and sat next to her. She stood up telling him to go and then he just sat in the middle of the sofa. And of course his retarded mate was still shouting and observing with a smile in the background.\n\nI felt my adrenaline rush and was thinking that I was now going to finally give in to this guys wish and beat the fuck out of him. His fat ass just sat there. I told him that he needed to get his retarded self out along with some stuff about him generally being a tard and I honestly expected him to... Still! Of course not, cos he was a rude idiot. I got in his face again and told him that I didnt want to hit him and that he should just leave. He was sat on the sofa and I was stood infront of him. if I had wanted to I could have really hurt him but I didnt. He felt my leg against his, shaking, and then started the age old schoolground put down of \"this pussy is shaking hes so scared\" and I, like the logical guy I was pointed out that my adrenaline was rushing because I was that serious about beating him up and that adrenaline can do such a thing. He kept saying dickish stuff to me as he very slowly got out over the next 5 or so minutes. saying \"your cool actually\" then saying \"naw, your a dick\". It was so fucking annoying.\n\nHe fucked off, slamming the door after him, going back to the flat directly below us and that flats owner stayed put once more. (Its funny cos he'd actually asked me about 10 minutes before the idiot came up if I wanted to go and have a play on his drums and I declined saying that I was having to sleep soon so didnt want to get my blood pumping.)\n\nHe stayed and all i wanted to do was calm down but he wouldnt shut the fuck up. He was being nice to me, and trying to say his mates actually really nice, which after a situation like that, where you see the evidence over and over again, and you know that guy is scum cos you gave him like 5 chances: its a fucking irritating thing to hear. Then he starts talking about how actually, \"he probably woulda battared ya mate\", and I start realising this new thing im feeling and it was HUMILIATION!!! Everything started to come together, this guy asked earlier if i lived here, i thought he knew that. He buzzed on our flat and came up to see if my girlfriend was here, i know its true cos he's sent her a few texts over the last few months asking her to go out mushroom picking. That plus the fact she's the most beautiful girl in the world is what made me realise that he was out to make me look like a prick.\n\nSo, my pissed off-ness started to emerge again but as you may now, know, i let a lot slide for some reason. i dont know why, but assholes really know how to waste my time and i cant get out of those \"street\" conversations where they talk about themselves and you feel sorry for them or like an idiot because you just dont have enough energy or care to empathise with them at all.\n\nWe were sat and my girlfriend turns and stares at me, the look of \"make him go\" is in the air and with only the slightest sprinkling of bullshit i say \"lets go to bed\". He starts exclaiming that we cant go to bed and midway through she leaves and then me and him have a wee moment... He says something along the lines of \"no way youre going to bed man, youve got tom jones on the tv and a comfy sofa, stay up\". I told him that we had shit to do tomorrow and we had to. He rejected this and said \"no way youre going to bed\", he then shouted my girlfriends name and we both stopped to listen for about 2 seconds. He then turned with a smile, sat down with one foot relaxing on the other knee and said \"im not going anywhere, my feet are down\" and all i can remember feeling at that moment was really fucking dissapointed. I said to him that he's being rude and we're going to bed but he can feel free to sit up and smoke his dumb brain's dumb acceleration herb on his own. I didnt say that, i was being a pussy about it. My girlfriend came back in as she was packing for her trip the next morning and he started asking what she was doing tomorrow... for like the 4th time (why do they all come to me!!). She was going to a wedding which I wasnt able to do and he started laughing and saying that her family must hate me and i must be a total cunt and stuff. He then commented on my unimpressed face, I nodded in agreement as i had basically given up now.\n\nThere were two more mentions of my unimpressedness and I felt like shit. I just said \"ok im off to bed then\" and left. My girlfriend called me back and said to wait for her. He then said something about not wanting to outstay his welcome, I said straight out that he had outstayed his welcome and he was being rude as fuck for the last ten minutes. Being told that infront of my girlfriend, he swiftly said sorry and left.\n\nThen, the door knocks. I go and answer it and its the owner asking me for his grinder. I made sure to shut the door in his fae as i went to go look. There was no grinder, there was never a grinder. i wondered what that noise was in the stair when he was at the door. I go back and say ill bring it back tomorrow, whilst the noise in the stair continued on, he said \"just drop it by later. its really important\" and left. The noise in the stair was the rugby guy chuckling like a fat ugly baby at their genius prank to every word the owner said.\n\nFor the next 2 hours, him and his mate downstairs were banging doors at a deliberately high level of volume AND retardedness and were playing music under our bedroom. The rugby guy even sat in the room under ours just talking to himself loudly.\n\nI opened the door at one point when i thought my bike was being damaged and heard the chuckles of idiocy once more from rugby girl. I felt like they were testing me.\n\nWhat the fuck should I have done?! I feel like an idiot kind of. I feel like the rugby guy was expecting to get punched cos he knew he deserved it, my girlfriend wanted me to, I wanted to so all parties seemed fairly ok. But i just could'nt do it. I cant throw a first punch but maybe its a good thing.\n\nIt'd be nice to hear if any similar stories"

I don't blame her, I probably sounded like a dick. Anyway, she asks me today to apologize to her, which I did promptly and sincerely.

I tell them I don't get internet, they put me on hold for 10 minutes and then hang up on me. \n\nI understand people who say \"if your internet isn't working, just go outside\" this isn't about that.

They're still getting paid, whether our internet works or not. And they're getting paid so much, one person switching to another service means nothing to them. \n\nThis problem won't be fixed.

            "value": "So I am so fed up with one of my teachers. A little about the class first:\n\nI get that this class is just an elective (Sociology of the media, apparently it's an elective now), but that doesn't mean that some students didn't *elect* to take it. The class is half people who want to take the class and expect to learn something (I fall here), and half people who are taking just because it was put into their schedule (that's a whole other rant, I have a billion of them about this school).\n\nNow back to the original subject of the rant, the teacher. This woman is a few crayons short of an 8ct set, yet she sees herself as delicate calligraphy brush. Whatever we are talking about she always has to make it sound like she is the all might decanter of wisdom. the class is largely monotone lectures, and she rarely actually engages the class (it's only 15 people, it shouldn't be that hard). However when she does call on someone it's not as if she is expecting intelligence. If someone is wrong she will correct them condescendingly, but even if they are right she will always find a way to demean them like \"I agree, also [obviously regurgitated technical jargon that nobody understands], but I don't think any of you will ever get that far into this subject. That's ok though, everybody is different.\"\n\nRecently she had us put the desks to the side of the room and sit in a circle on the floor \"Criss-cross applesauce\" (WE'RE FUCKING JRs AND SRs IN HIGH SCHOOL WOMAN. THE KID NEXT TO ME WREAKS OF WEED AND HAS A FULL GROWN BEARD FOR CRYING OUT LOUD) while we she had is go around the circle and tell everyone our name, and four things we like. She seemed rather bored as the first few people went (sitting at her desk literally browsing reddit. I hope you see this, you know you are), then it got to weed-beard next to me who mentioned that he was into astral projection. You'll never guess what we spent the rest of class talking about... fucking astral projection. Next class we had a fairly banal lecture, then she brought out board games, and did that for the rest of class. I tried to work on homework for another class (half of my schedule is college level), but she stopped me and said that I must participate in the class activity. When I tried to posit that this homework for AP language and composition was more important than apples to apples she sent me to the head of discipline with a write up for \"Disrupting the learning environment\".\n\nSkip ahead to next class, pop quiz. Four simple questions, yet it matters because it is the only grade in the book. She calls me over to her desk while she's grading them (we're back to playing board games, I'm sneakily doing homework so I thought she caught me... nope) She shows me my quiz, 0%. Why you ask? Because I had a grammar mistake, and half of these big words I made up... For the record that grammar mistake was an incorrect article , because \"an historic\" is wrong (it's not by the way, I checked with three separate teachers in the English department, and not only did I use the words correctly, spelled correctly, in the correct tense and conjugation, but with proper articles and grammar as well). What happened when I disagree with her? She sends me down to discipline with the same fucking write up. So now I have a 0 in the class, flat failing. Next day (block schedule, I only have that class every other day) I get called to the counseling office for an \"academic intervention\" with my counselor and this teacher who is the spawn of Mephistopheles because I am failing her class. When I try to explain what is going on I get told to my face that I am flat lying. Oh, and that I can't make up the quiz, and she lost the original but what I was saying wasn't true. Meanwhile I'm missing an important section of notes for AP statistics.\n\nI make an appointment with her after school to discuss what I can do to raise my grade because eligibility checks are coming up soon, and I need to be passing my classes to attend Mile high Jazz festival with my school's Jazz band. Guess what, she doesn't show up. I go across the hall to ask another social studies teacher where she is, and he tells me that she is in her office. So I head down to her office (small cubicle in a classroom converted multi-teacher office space), and find that she is the only one there and she knows it. She's blasting country music so I needed to knock pretty loud to get her attention. When she answered the door she literally said \"Oh shit, I was trying to avoid you. I will let you retake the quiz tomorrow, but only because you're being such a whiny bitch about it. Now if you'll excuse me, I have business to attend to!\" as she slams the door, and locks it.\n\nUnder normal circumstances I would report this teacher to administration, but she has been employed by the school for 5 years \"without incident\", so all my complaints get scoffed at. I was thinking about requesting that someone audit this class, but then I learned that my school won't audit electives, and won't audit normal classes without a sufficient number of complaints (research turned out that this number is equal to half the class rounded up). I thought about dropping it, but this late in the semester that's a drop-fail, which I don't want on my record. However I'm wondering how much longer I can put up with this woman.\n\n**TL;DR** She's a arrogant, narcissistic, bitch of a woman who not only has to be right all the time, but everybody else has to be wrong. She's not teaching, not being a teacher, not treating us appropriately for the level of maturity (or IQ) of our class, and there's not a damn thing I can do about it short of violence (not a path I want to go down) or legal action (which would require sufficient evidence)."

Wtf. Fine. Whatever. I've put up with her shit for the last eight and a half years, and I'm through not being able to get shit for myself, but then she can turn around and get something even more valuable than what I had. \n\nI.E: I had a gym membership at the hospital I work at. $30/month. \"Oh, no, we can't afford that right now. But we'll get you one again soon.\" Not even two months later, she can have a gym membership for $65/month. Catch my drift? And this has happened with little and large things. I have to make the sacrifice, and she gets the whole reward. I know it sounds kinda selfish, but after a while, one begins to get beyond frustrated. \n\nI digress. \n\nShe asks me to move into the spare room and suggests I move out soon. Well, a couple of days ago I was packing, get ready to move out necessities that day and thought, \"since I'm leaving, I should take the condoms, since she doesn't have a dick.\" (that's because she is one.) I go to the spot to get them, and....nothing. They're not there. Kinda odd. The night before, she mentioned she was going to stay at a \"friend's\" place that night. She has always told me who she was with. Not this time. \n\nThe next day, I return, as a repair person is coming out to the house. I decided to check for the condoms again. Boom. Two sitting right there, when they weren't there the day before. Naturally, I get a little suspicious, and commence detective work. I found a morning-after pill in the trash from the day before.\n\nThe kicker? She asked me earlier this week if I had ever cheated on her (which I hadn't). But now that we're getting divorced, it's ok for you to go fuck around while we're still married?! If you wanted it that bad, you could have just fucking said you wanted to sleep with someone else. But no! Your selfish, worthless ass just goes and fucks some guy while everyday, I'm trying to fix our marriage, you dirty whore! What the flying shit. Thank god we don't have kids, because it would be soooooo hard to tell them that their mother is such a giant cunt, that your own cunt is probably jealous of you. I tried to give you a great life, but now you've turned careless and cold, which happened so fast, that liquid nitrogen would freeze. Rot in hell, you bitch. I loved you and all you ever did was THINK ABOUT YOURSELF. Oh, and thanks for telling everyone that the divorce was my idea. Now, I look like a massive turd. \n\nI should have left your ass the first time I had the chance. But my dumbass had to turn around and want to fix it. Just so you could lie to my face. Blow those fucking words out the back of your head. \n\nGo fuck yourself. I hope you choke on your lunch."

It had nothing to do with party affiliations or the fact that this seemed like a weird, dumbed down version of the Newsroom speech; it was her listing off all those stats as fact without listing any sources. Plus, the fact that her stats were wrong! I tried asking her to clarify herself, to list her sources, for proof of what she's saying. I asked if she took into consideration the fact that, in some countries, women aren't allowed to report rape without fear of reprecussions. Or if she considered children being married off to grown men forms of rape when she said that the US had the highest rape stats. I asked if she took into consideration the crime and drug use per capita, instead of just as large number for a heavily populated country. Instead of having a civil conversation with me she accused me of harassing her, cyber bullying and trolling. Then she blocked me and deleted all my comments. Next, she wrote on her public wall about how I was harassing her. I know I shouldn't let it effect me but it has me so mad! Mad that she is just wrong, but refuses to admit it, mad at her arrogance, and really mad at being accused of things when I was just trying to have a civil conversation and enlighten her perspective.

So obviously they didnt like it because it was mindless action with no genuine characters or story arcs to follow.... But fast five is at a 77% and the consensus reads as follows: \"Sleek, loud, and over the top, Fast Five proudly embraces its brainless action thrills and injects new life into the franchise.\"..... so wtf? they like it more now because they feel like it got even more brainless than before? idk I did a full rant video right here if anybody wants to hear it:\nhttps://youtu.be/GcLR6jrHXSU\nBut i wanna hear everybodys thoughts here.... for me, I really dont care if the action got more over the top and brainless... it still offers me nothing compelling in terms of storytelling, character depth, or even a believable world... why would i recommend a F&F movie when I can recommend a far more superior action movie like Mad Max:Fury Road or The Raid 2?"

There's no way of knowing who they are and how many of these fuckers there are. The only clear thing is that the stalkers got a God complex and they get off on manipulating and torturing me.\n\nHere are some highlights of the stalker attacks:\n\n- it started out innocent enough, with just regular stalking and harrassment\n- then, it escalated to daily stalking with tire slashing, window smashing, spray painting my door, .... Eventually I developed panick attacks and could barely leave the house.\n- I lost my Uni scholarship and my job. This was especially painful. Prior to this, I had lived in a cold garage of my foster family. I had lived on next to nothing while working part-time for 2 years, -- all so that I could save up enough money to go back to studies. This was all gone because of the attacks. \n- the stalkers stole everything (literally everything I had except the clothes on my back)\n- they kept preventing me from getting a new job and going back to study\n\n\n  Part of this is also my fault, though. Early during the stalker attacks, I remember I couldn't believe that somebody would do this to another human being (so stupid!). I couldn't figure out how the stalkers could pin-point my location, despite taking strange routes and back-tracking etc. The answer is obvious: the stalkers had access to my phone/ipad. At the time, I couldn't figure it out, but looking back at it, it is very much my fault. Why to fuck would I believe that people are this nice? It's fucking retarded! It was my fault for believing that the stalkers were regular \"people\" who wouldn't torture me as much as they did.\n\nThings were/are gonna get worse! Always! After about 1 year of daily attacks, the stalkers stepped up the game: they broke in and stole everything. Having no job, uni scholarship, and now no place to live, I ended up cruising the streets for a week, and then crawling back to stay with my foster family.\n\n\nNeedless to say, the stalker attacks only increased. They got about 20k + everything I got from me. Now they were gonna con my foster family. Over the next year, the stalkers swindled 15k from my foster family!\n\n\nAnd so, I saved  up money for 2 years so that I could go back to studies and get a good job, then 1 year of study and being attacked, then another year of no job and no studies and daily stalker attacks. I developed a great variety of problems: \n- still get panic attacks\n- stomach ulcer\n- self injury: I had even regularly uploaded pics for stalkers to see. I think they loved it.\n- night terrors: I sleep maybe 2-3 hours a day, then wake up screaming, everyday for nearly 2 years now. This shit is not going away, just like the scars from cutting.\n- obsessive thoughts / paranoia : I had a \"revelation\" in January this year, I realized that I had spent an entire afternoon (maybe 3-4 hours) in a single day without the words \"stalker\" in my mind. This was the 1st time in over a year that I had a \"normal\" afternoon. Otherwise, I obsess about the stalker attacks several times per hour every day for the last 2 years.\n- suicide struggles \n\n\nAll the same, I wanted to move away from my foster family and go back to school and get a steady job. And so, I waited 1 more year for the next round of applications. Things were finally looking up! I didn't have enough savings, but if I got another p/t job, I think could have pulled off the studies. Start to live independently again and stop the stalker attacks! \n\n\nOf course, the stalkers would not allow me to live. The uni application deadline is now past. So that's that. Welfare is my only way now.\n\n\nI really wish that I had turned around one of those days and just smashed their fucking heads! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

After 20 mins of holding back they finally go to leave, he shouts something to me about my sister. I. Fucking. Snap. I punch him in the face. Front door glass cracks during fight. Him and his friends leave. Police arrive. I have 2 weeks left in the job before I was leaving to move in with friends  while they go college id go working and this shit happens. I'm broke as fuck and cant make next months rent because ill have to pay to fix the fucking door glass but thats ok because theres a good chance ill go to prison for assault and have to pay this prick compensation and then ill be so far in debt having to pay for the door will look like a fucking picnic.

Neutral if nothing else. I'll say hi if I see you as I'm walking in. I'll let you know if I want to do something that might impact you (like cutting a limb off your tree that's crossing the property line). All I ask is the same in return.\n\nThis past weekend, I didn't receive that. What I got instead was attitude. \n\nI was doing some yard work as homeowners are wont to do. After working myself up fairly well, I decided to go inside and rest for an hour or so. I come back out and glance over to the edge of my back yard, noticing a lot of shattered red brick pieces that weren't there before. (I don't have any loose red brick). I already feel my blood beginning to rise in temperature at this point so I walk over and see two of the neighbor's kids (\"4 and 7 years old, they're 4 and 7 years old\") building a fort out of undamaged red brick. In my side yard. Presumably they were just tossing the bad ones out of the way of their fort supply. \n\nThere weren't too many, so I picked up the broken ones and put them back on the neighbor's brick pile (in their side yard. I know kids will be kids, and I'm willing to let almost anything slide once. ***Once.*** \n\nSo I walk over and speak to the mom, asking her nicely if she could have her kids move the fort back over to their yard ('cause I'm not moving ~40 bricks myself) and not toss brick chunks in mine, as I don't want one to damage my mower or possibly even hurt my dogs. She's nice and courteous as can be and says she'll take care of it. \n\nI go back to working in the yard. I work out there until dark, some 3-4 hours after I spoke to the mother. The fort is still fully assembled in my side yard. She leaves and I've decided her time is up. \n\nNow I will admit I may have gotten a little petty with this part, but fuck her. I walked over and haphazardly tossed every single one of those bricks the 4 feet back over my property line onto hers, while also being sure not to actually hit and damage anything with the bricks. The area covered also included the spot where she parks her car (not part of the driveway). \n\nAfter taking care of that, I finally head back inside. I shower. I eat dinner. 30 minutes pass and I get a knock at the door. Gee, I wonder who it could be? I open the door and before I could say anything, she starts off the conversation, which I'll repeat here as best I can remember? She will be NB (Neighbor Bitch)\n\nNB: Was that really necessary?\n\nMe: No, it wasn't, but I did ask you to get the bricks moved back onto your yard some five hours ago, and I need to mow that yard tomorrow\n\nNB: You waited until I left before you threw all that shit on my yard, why would you do that? You know that's where I park right?\n\nME: I assumed that since it'd been 5 hours and you had left, it wasn't going to get done unless I did it. \n\nNB: I would have gotten them to move the bricks if you'd asked, you just said you didn't want them to throw them in your backyard (note that I did ask her to move them). They're just 4 and 7, did you really have to destroy their fort like that\n\nMe: I understand that, but I needed them off my yard. \n\nThe response I wish I'd thought of then was \"Yes, and that's the perfect age for them to be taught respect for other people's property.\" or \"Sure, and how old are you? Shouldn't you be responsible for them?\"\n\nIt kind of continued like that on repeat for a couple of iterations until my girlfriend came over and kind of disrupted things. NB walked away and we haven't had issue from them since. Definitely going to be getting a camera and extending the fence there when we have it rebuilt though.\n\n**TL;DR Neighbor bitch lets kids build brick fort and toss brick trash into MY yard. I ask nicely for it to be removed and give her 4-5 hours to get it done. I toss the bricks back myself, and the SHE gets in a huff like I'M the one that did something wrong, instead of teaching her kids respect and manners.**"

I pray that everyone around you sees you for what you really are and that you NEVER dare to come near my family again. As much as I dislike them for their selfish, snobbish ways at least they care even the tiniest bit.\n\nI can at least give them that tiny bit of credit which is due, Despite the fact they are also greedy and care more for themselves then us. I'm use to being an outcast so this is nothing new but the fact you tried to play us off against them by using MY emotions against me is despicable.\n\nYOU of all fucking people should know how I feel about others attempting to lie and manipulate and what happens to them. I cut them out of my life which I have done to you.

She had more love in her then anyone I've ever known and it was wasted on you. I wish you took her place. Even if her body broke down and so did her mind at least I could survive that. \n\nI don't care if you took us in after she died because you died a very long time ago didn't you? I almost became like you at one point when things were getting rough and I couldn't help myself..

            "value": "I have to get this out somewhere, there is a long backstory here, so bear with me. My mother met a guy online on some facebook community of former Marines, they fell in love, yada yada she moved away to be with him and have been happy for a few years. They've had their issues, he loved his drinking and such, but he made the effort to stop. Plus, he was bad with money, so my mother handled all their finances, and taught him how to do so, to the point where he was able to take over with my mother cross checking and ensuring things were done properly. However, when her father got ill, she had to move back down to be with her family to help take care of her father. However, that left the new husband without a car, so he okayed her to purchase a new vehicle that way my mother could give him her Tahoe, and she buy a new one. So mother does that, kewl things are great, if not a little stressful, but great.  \n\n On Thursday March 31st, I was informed by my mother that her husband had maxed out all of their credit cards, meaning that the truck he said she could purchase, she actually couldn't afford, and that if the remaining down payment was not given, BOTH her trucks would be lost, since she still has payments to make on the Tahoe, but that the deal was willing to work with her if we could bring the Tahoe back.  \n\nSo, I take off the rest of the day at work, rent a car and tell her, let's go and grab it. I tell her NOT to tell him we are on the way because clearly, he has already screwed over my mom, and that we will pick it up, pack up as much as her stuff as we can, and go. When we are an hour away, we call him to let him know that he cannot go to work, that we are going to be picking up the truck because he has essentially lied and screwed mom over, to which he cries, says he can't face her, that he is ashamed and by the time we arrive, he is not there. Fine, whatever, let's pack.  \n\nUpon entering the house, we find it a disaster, dog hair everywhere, cat litter not cleaned for weeks, there was not even any litter, it was just feces and no cat food and empty liquor bottles EVERYWHERE. To top it off, we find out he hasn't been going to work, hasn't been paying rent, been borrowing money from everyone else, leaving their financials tight. PLUS, we also come to find out that his two banks were holding both his work check AND VA check because he stopped paying on the credit cards. In the 5 months my mother left him to take care of her father, this, CREATURE, accumulated 60k on the credit cards. And that's on TWO that we know off.  \n\nSo already, we are angry, and upset, because my mother can't fit everything into the truck. We have to trash and destroy a lot of her stuff, but we get everything packed up. The landlord comes over and takes a look at the house and is of course, upset to see it in such a sad state and states he is going to get started on paperwork to evict the man.  \n\nSo after we are packed, we check the oil, clean up the snow, and start the long trip back south. We first stop and sleep for the night because I had not slept, since Thursday night, it was now Saturday night. By Sunday morning, we hit the road and we notice The truck was struggling a little bit, but we thought it was too heavy and threw out even more of my mothers stuff at a dumpster to see if it would lighten the load. We eventually reach Pennsylvania and that's when things take an ugly turn. No matter how much we give it gas, the car won't accelerate and the engine makes a horrible rattling sound. Great, the engine is blown. so I am like, wait, is that the reason why he wasn't going to work? He knew SOMETHING was wrong with the truck, and didn't even TELL us about it, KNOWING we were going to drive back in it? (He lives in New England and family is in Florida). Fine, I thought, I will make this work. It is Sunday, I can't do much, but I start trying to sell his phone, that my mother took back since she paid for it, his laptop, again, paid for by mother, and a junk place for the car, so we can at least have some money and I will rent a car first thing Monday morning. So I start making calls, posting on craigslist, etc trying to sell these items, and retire for the night.   \n\nIt is now Monday, and things just kept getting worse. When I try and get the registration for the car, it is not there. We were driving without the registration for the vehicle. The, CREATURE, fracking TOOK IT OUT OF THE GLOVEBOX! So basically, can't even fracking scrap it. WTF, FINE. Of course craigslist is full of scammers wanting to buy the items via paypal, so nothing solid yet. Call another car rental place because the initial rental I got I returned 30 minutes late because of a snow storm in the area. So my credit card got two more day usage charges from the rental agency and that was putting my credit limit in a tight spot. The new agency wanted a 400 deposit and I was like WTF! We make call to all our family and we get around to getting the funds. We have to go to Walmart for a money gram, then a money order that we write to ourselves and then deposit to our banks. So then we walk 30 minutes (forgot to mention this, but my mother is disabled, so this has been especially taking on her) to the closest rental agency only to be told that they will only accept a major credit card because we are from out of state.  \n\n......My mother's credit card and mine are now practically maxed, so we have the money, but not the credit card to use. We are stranded. In Pennsylvania , because of this guy. I was supposed to be at work, and now I have no idea when I will be able to RETURN to work because, again, we are stranded. All because this guy couldn't be honest with my mother. He couldn't admit to her he was struggling since she left, he couldn't see her face to face and tell her he ruined her car. Instead he ran and hid, this is a 50 year old former Marine we are talking about here.  \n\nThere are no words to describe the amount of hate I feel toward this man right now. There is no words to describe the amount of stress I am under. My mother won't stop crying, she got to the point where she wanted me to leave her and get home to my job and leave her behind I asked her what she was going to do and she got hysterical telling me not to ask her that. I knew what she was thinking and I wasn't going to have any of that.  \n\nIt is, just a series of unfortunate events that keep occurring and there is no way it is getting better. Because all of the charges haven't cleared on my credit card yet, I can't make any payments, and without a way to make the payments, I'm stuck.  \n\nAnger is not enough. Rage, hate, spite, nothing is enough to explain the way I feel toward this guy right now. But as much as I want to focus on that, I have to find a way to get me and my mother home, safe. What a nightmare this has been...  \n  \n  \nedit: Said May 31st, when it was March 31st"

Most of the time it's helpful, but there's just one thing..\n\n\nIt is absolutely comical what size some people on there claim to be. Until its not, and then it's just infuriating. Like bitch, there is no physically possible way that you can be 5'3\", 200 pounds, and a size TEN. **I BARELY FIT INTO A TEN. AT OLD NAVY. WEIGHING 155. AND I'M TALLER THAN YOU.** The only way a 200 pound woman could *possibly* be a size 10 is if she were a body builder or well over 6ft tall. I'm looking at your picture and you are neither of those. You are clearly at LEAST a 14, most likely a 16. So fuck outta here with this bullshit. (and we're both American so there's a sizing system difference or anything)\n\n\nI really don't know why it pisses me off so much when people do this.

I'm sure ppl have this problem here too and i'm not unique but i just wanna vent about this and maybe get some insight from ppl. There aren't a lot of things that get me angry to the point of lashing out, but there is a video game that i play that makes me very upset sometimes and i lash out very aggressively.  \n\nI've been playing the game for almost 8 years now and it's something that i don't really want to give up, but i've been dealing with anger issues since i was a child so i don't know what else to do since i feel like i'm never gonna get over them.  \n\nThe adhd/autism makes me a very impulsive person, not to use those as an excuse, but it's just true. I do things without thinking a lot, and most of the time it's not that big of a deal but with anger it's obviously very bad to be impulsive.  \n\ngenerally what happens is once i get to a certain level of frustration, my brain goes blank and i just wanna break something. I'll slam my keyboard on the desk, throw something across the room, break glass, punch walls, etc. I know that a big way to stop doing it is to just not give into the impulses, because the more you do the easier it is for you to go \"blank\".  \n\nIt's really hard for me to describe the feeling, and i'm not very articulate when it comes to it so bear with me please. Basically, X situation happens, i react and get angry. After a certain point, i feel like i have almost no control. I get an absolute INSANE burst of adrenaline, and the only way it goes away is if i do something physically. I don't know why specifically, but phsyically breaking something is always what makes me most relieved. I think it's probably something to do with the fact that something is \"resisting\" me and i break the resistance by breaking the item. And all of the adrenaline goes away when i get that release.  \n\nIt's super fucked up and impulsive and even just sitting here typing it out i'm so fucking mad because i just want to stop. I used to not really regret it afterwards, but now everytime i just feel like complete shit after even if i don't break anything expensive or whatever.  \n\nIt's such a fucking shitty feeling to be out of control and i don't ever want it to get super bad. At it's worst was probably when i was like 10-13 where i would regularly break my games/toys etc, and there were 2 instances where i actually lashed out at a person who made me angry, both times i punched the person once and immediately felt worse than i'd ever felt before.  \n\nLike i said, even just typing about how i hate being impulsive makes me so angry i almost feel the impulse to break something come on. It's absolutely my most hated quality about myself and it makes me feel so ashamed.\nLike i said, most of this was just venting because i'm still pissed off (i just had an \"episode\" i guess you'd call it, nothing is broken but i slammed down my keyboard at my desk and that was even enough for me to feel like shit) and i kinda just want to know if anybody has this same specific issue and if they could give me any advice. Thanks again and sorry for the long post."

It means cutting out so many people out of my life leaving me with little left. People will say it's better to have good friends than bad ones. But I think having bad friends is better than having no friends.\n\nAnd there is a part of me that wants to believe that these people aren't bad friends and that I am just delusional. But for example, how can rationalize  a friend sending me a heartfelt message, saying he is here for me to talk etc, while my sister is very sick and was on life support (she is home and doing better now, but it was hard and scary at the time) but 2 weeks and 6 messages sent later...he still hasn't messaged me back.\n\nIt is really conflicting. It kills me inside whenever I think about how I can't rely on my friends, but I can't bring myself to cut all of them out of my life. I feel like I have lost but I can't bring myself to accept that I have lost, if that makes any sense.\n\nI don't know what else to say.

Sometimes on the street some white dude, old or young, will see me walk by and shout, \"NIHAO!\"\n\nThis bugs me for a variety of reasons. I talked to my husband (white and French) about how profoundly it bothers me, and he said they're probably just trying to find a cute way to communicate. I get him thinking that, but in the same way you know when somebody is trying to be charming or cute, I know that is not what this is. (Once on the train, a guy sat in front of me and said it repeatedly, staring hard into my face for a reaction. There's a kind of ballsy, nasty violence to it.)\n\nAnyway, last night I was in Berlin, walking with a female friend. It wasn't that late, and we were talking about the nice weekend we'd had. Then these high school kids fell in step with us\u2014one a minority, one not\u2014and the white guy started going, \"Nihao. Nihao. NIHAO.\"\n\nI know I shouldn't have reacted, don't feed the trolls and all, but I started acting before I even realised I was doing it. I told the kid to fuck off. I saw him get excited. He started repeating it, wide-eyed, louder and faster. I raised my fist, and he raised his too.\n\nI could hear all the voices of reason in my head going, \"Stop this, ignore him, you don't know this kid, you don't know what can happen, he could have a knife, you could get badly hurt, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?\"\n\nTo the right of me, I could see his friend. He looked visibly uncomfortable, was trying to get his buddy to stop in a whisper. His friend was ignoring him. He smelled blood. In this moment I hated the other kid a little. There was a cowardice there. I knew he was trying to do the right thing, but there was this shouting in my head\u2014like, Do you have any idea what this does to a woman, how much it hurts? Also, you must know what this is like, being a person of colour, too. How can you just roll with it?\n\nAll these thoughts stopped me just long enough for me to lose the element of surprise, so I didn't move. The little \"nihao\" cretin ran over to a glass storefront with terrace seats, and I picked up a seat and threw it at him. He ducked into the store just in time for the chair to crash into the glass door. (Nothing broke, but I could see the unhappy faces of the shopkeepers, and I felt awful.)\n\nAnyway, they briefly retreated. I was shaking, and my friend pulled me into a bakery to distract me with ideas about dessert. I heard the guys returning, the white one just standing out there, in front of the glass, repeating \"nihao, nihao, nihao.\"\n\nI tucked my scarf into my backpack and answered the baker's questions\u2014what cakes did we want?\u2014distractedly. I felt fed up with this, years and years of this, and knew that, if they were still out there when we came out, I was going to do something. I could see myself sitting on his back, scraping his face into the pavement.\n\nBut they weren't there. The night went on, I apologised to my friend, she apologised for me having gone through that (\"Omg, does this happen to you a lot?\"), we went home, had dinner, chatted some more, and went to bed. But I just lay awake, thinking about this kid. I could still hear him in my ears. And I can't stop thinking, Fuck, the next person who does this to me, I will probably try to hurt really badly. Something will go wrong, I'll get in trouble or be badly hurt, and this will just look to most people like some chick went crazy over a misguided \"effort to communicate\".\n\nI can't explain to what degree this, and everything else it encompasses\u2014the model minority pressure, the many times I've been made small because it was assumed I wouldn't fight back, the everyday terrorism of being a woman and having to find a way to gracefully \"ignore\" or \"not react\" or \"take it as a compliment\"\u2014is like death by thousands and thousands of cuts. In that moment all I could think of was how badly I wanted that kid to feel that distinct pain of tiny razors bleeding you, bit by bit.\n\nI know this sounds crazy. Which brings me to my question: How can I shut this down and make a future \"nihao\" perpetrator think about the dumbass thing he's doing, or at least feel shame? I know violence is not the answer, but I at least want to know what I can say that can moat the crap out of these jerks. I'm sick of the dignified ignoring and what I want is for them to feel how I feel. \n\nBecause this little act of nastiness is just as violent, just as painful, as if they touched me: They don't care who I am, where I'm from, what I'm doing. They decimate all of that with one little word.\n\nI noticed that, a couple of years ago, someone addressed this same subject but with a different angle (\"why do they do it?\"): https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/25iw2y/im_asian_girl_and_im_fed_up_with_some_random/\n\nI don't really care why they do it unless it helps me fight back. Anyway. Any ideas on what I can say, or do, or ... I don't know, anything?"

He has a fucking arrogant air about him now, and it seems like he's looking down at me, even though I'm taller than him. He tries to start fights over EVERYTHING, such as the way I MAKE MY OWN GOD DAMN COFFEE! He treats me like I'm below him, even though I'm a hell of a lot better than him in a lot of things. Another thing is, I've been into computers since early childhood, and know pretty much anything you could ask about them, I got him into them a few years back, and although he knows more than most people, I probably know 5 times more than him still. In conversations, I'll often say something about computers, and he will contradict me, when I pull out my phone, google it, and prove him wrong, he'll just go \"Oh, well, I guess\" And still act like he's FUCKING BETTER THAN ME. I've been trying to hold it in, but it is pissing me off WAY TO MUCH these days, and I can't stand being near his fucking above all thoughts. He is just pissing me off so damn much, and is making me rage. I can't stand classes with him, and especially now, when he does finally act friendly, he acts like its a favor to me, like hes pitying me, thats probably what makes me the angriest, I mean, IF YOU DON'T FUCKING LIKE ME THEN LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE, DON'T BE A FUCKING DUMB ARROGANT DIP SHIT! Even the thought of him now makes me type this like I want to break my keyboard, and I think I'm going to have to go for a run to calm myself down.

She stopped for a while during the therapy and after but now it's been worse than ever. This is partially due to my father having an affair on her and me telling her about it for years until he confessed. I started feeling trapped and suicidal because of her. Her presence makes the thoughts terrible. I tried to seek help but she just yelled and threw a tantrum about it. I don't trust her. I don't want to improve my relationship with her but that's all the therapist wants to do. I feel like I'm falling apart. She takes away my coping methods like it's a game to her. She's unreasonable and scary. I talked to my brother and he said he felt the same way before going to college. That I could make it too, but I really can't. Today my school psychologist told her about the sexual abuse I went through in the past and the cycle it caused. School used to be my escape but it's  become just as bad because of the days ive missed and the psychologist. She's going to isolate me again and make me unable to seek help. This is probably a few hours before I can't contact anyone for weeks or months. I'm a happy person when she isn't around. I wish she would die.

I spent like 45 minutes preparing a cake, baked it for like an hour, and then set it up to cool off and let it cool for 3 hours and posted pictures of each step. I put actual work into something and shared it in detail, and people literally went out of their way to downvote it, but a FUCKING CHEESEBURGER MADE IT TO THE FRONT PAGE OF REDDIT?

And about the fact that they used the house phone to listen in on me. But it was my stupid self who didn't notice. I saw the phone and thought that my grandmother accidentally left it on. She has done it before. I wanted to make a call. I found the phone. Saw that it was still on. Put it on the hook. Then proceed to check the house to see if anyone is here. Then I said the things about myself that I can't say without people thinking it's about them. But unfortunately I didn't know anyone was listening. If I did I wouldn't have said s***. "

I called the cops but he keeps saying that he is my grandfather and the cop believes him. ugghhh this is making my life so angry i just had to vent somewhere.\n\nEdit 1:\nAfter the cops left he kept insisting to me he was my grandfather. I kept telling him no he wasn't while also asking him to leave hoping maybe he would but he wouldn't. Then he would go back to the bathtub for whatever reason that may be and just made funny noises for a short period of time. He then started just turning my bathroom into a little hang out. He invited 2 more friends over they all went to the bathroom. I called the cops again, They told me to just submit my \"grandfather\" to a mental hospital, I told them he wasn't my grandfather but they chuckled and said to me maybe \"I should call my parents to pick him up\" the cops then left. as suggested in the comments I'll be calling a lawyer in the morning to hopefully sort this out.\n\nEdit: 2 Made new post for the last bit of the story as I figured this one would just get tl;dr'd."

It's not that she's a bad mother or anything, but I've been living with her 21 years. I don't want to talk to her because either I have nothing to talk to her about or because whatever I have to talk to her about I can't. She keeps asking however, and I keep telling her it's fine, even if I don't mean it because I can't tell her to leave me the fuck alone, because she's my mother. I'm sick of hearing the same shit from her. I'm sick of her telling me to get dressed because it's \"cold\". I'm sick of her \"leaving me some housework to do\" which she does later if I haven't done it immediately, then whenever an argument breaks out she blames me for not doing anything for myself and \"wo is me, what will you do when I'm not around?\" while sobbing. There's only so much that I'm willing to step on eggshells around my mother to keep her happy because she expects me to be like her. I'm not. I do things my way and at my own pace. I'm fucking sick of arguing with her, I'm fucking sick of talking to her, I'm fucking sick of having to exchange smalltalk with her because it's customary. I want her to leave me alone. I don't want to live with her, I can't stand being in the same house as her. I don't care if this makes me an ungrateful bastard of a child, I would rather dig a hole in the forest and live there than stand to be around her. But I can't.

And I can't say any of this to her. How could I? She doesn't do it on purpose and that's worse. It's who she is and she's too old to change, and I've got no right to demand it of her. I just want to leave... being around her is so frustrating that it leaves me exhausted. I can't take it anymore."

Brazil has one official language and that's Portuguese, the mother tongue of over 99% of the population. Other languages spoken are indigenous languages, German, and Italian.

We'll talk about something else. I'm sure we'll get by fine communicating exclusively in English. In fact, I speak fluent English, but like I said, I speak close to no Spanish, so you're really just making life harder for me.\n\nNow, if you really are interested - ask me questions. Ask me questions you genuinely want to know the answers to, and expect the answers to be long, and complex, and personal. Don't ask me if I can dance samba.

My culture is a huge, essential part of who I am. People often comment that I'm \"so English\" - I'm not. I'm 100% Brazilian, and that includes the parts of me that have found it easy to adapt in England, that includes the parts of me that used to find it hard to live in Brazil, as well as my love for black beans and pandeiros and shrimps of a dignified size.

            "value": "Dear R. \nWhat you truly don't get is that you are a bully. I may have sent an awful text, but I never tried to justify that. And it is the only time I have ever gotten angry at you. You don't understand the extent you have hurt me, and maybe you never will. But understand this: YOU ARE A BULLY. I have a document of 600 pages of texts where you systematically socially excluded me, cursed at me, and called me names repeatedly for two years. You took advantage of me because you knew that I was terrified that if I didn't have you, I wouldn't have anyone (and I don't have anyone now and it's still better than you). I did nothing to deserve this. I tried to support you. I forgave you. I tried to help you fix your self-esteem issues and your eating disorders. Congratulations, R., because in return you managed to break me and I finally snapped because I didn't know what else to do and I'm sorry.  \n\nWe may have had some good times together, but deep in my heart I know that those things I said were true. And I think you know that too. For truth cutteth the guilty to the very core, and you, my dear R., are very guilty. And you don't even realize how much of a hypocrite you really are, which is hilarious. How many times have you ever apologized immediately to me? How many times have you cursed me out, called me names, ignored me until I cried for the crime of \"annoying you\" when I just was trying to talk to you. You think it is fine to leave mid-conversation, answer long heartfelt texts with mhm, or simply not respond at all. Yet, when I didn't respond to you in an hour (when you have made me wait days, weeks, or even months for simple answers), you threaten me and make me so scared that I made a 600 page document to protect myself against your threats (which of course you never followed through with). Then you get you and your boyfriend (A.) on the phone, *by the way you are both almost two years older than me* and he proceeds to tell me that I am the bully and that \"if R. commits suicide how would you feel?\" so he is basically saying it would be my fault. He berates me until I cry and apologize to him and to you. I was in the middle of church and you made me call you and I had to stand out in public in the middle of a parking lot talking to you and you made me cry for an hour, sobbing in a corner. And you would blame me, really, if you committed suicide? As if you don't have a choice. As if I actually have control over anything you say or do.\n \nYou are simply an attention monger (really you are 19 and still making \"cute\" noises to draw attention to yourself? Even Mr.C. was embarrassed by your childish antics.) and let me tell you one word: KARMA. I may be completely alone and miserable, but you are terrible person and you will get nowhere in life. You are killing yourself with lack of sleep, eating disorders, and being in general a terrible person (who cusses out their parents and siblings on a regular basis in public? Your mom is adorable and sweet and even she is fed up with your crap.). You will never be satisfied in life because you value things, and treat other people like they have no feelings and are disposable. You create power imbalances in relationships by manipulating other people to do whatever you want, and then you move on to whatever \"shiny toy\" (your words on justifying ditching me for A., remember?) you find next. And you assume I wouldn't care because you said \"I thought you were a heartless robot\" after I spent a year telling you my deepest darkest secrets.\n\n I am not the crazy one here. You are. You treat me like crap for an entire year, and with the first sign of things looking up I spend twenty dollars of my own money (when you steal daddy's credit card or spend your parents money whenever to buy clothes you will never wear) to buy you halal gummy bears (which you had wanted for years). And what do you do? CUSS ME OUT THE NEXT DAY BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T VEGETARIAN AND THEN CONTINUE TO EAT THEM ANYWAY. I couldn't make this up if I tried, you are that ridiculous sometimes. \n\nAnd you say \"I'm sorry.\" and \"I'm eternally sorry\" and \"I am so sorry\". But we both know you don't mean it. Why? Because you are currently playing this same trick on two more unsuspecting victims. And when I pointed that out, you once again denied that you had seriously hurt anybody's feelings with a simple \"I am handling the situation\". Really, R.? You are \"handling\" it. We both know how good you are at handling situations. In response to N. (your younger sister who you are supposed to look out for) being coerced by that slimeball S. to giving him a hand job and who knows what else, you make her your slave, make her live in fear that she is going to be shipped back to ____, and control every second of her life. You wait months to tell your mother, and you never go to outside help. No dip Sherlock, you suck at handling things. You act all concerned about N. cutting herself, you see the pain it causes you and everyone else, and then YOU CUT YOURSELF AND THINK ITS NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL. WHAT KIND OF PERSON DOES THAT? And then despite all the crap you have done to me, as soon as I see those scars, I am the only one who knows that I need to run, not walk, run to the guidance counselor and get your sorry little butt in counseling (no thanks received, of course). \n\nAnd you know what the worst thing you ever did to me was? All I wanted for my birthday last year was to have you and N. come over, watch Netflix and just hang out and have snacks. Was that too much to ask? My mom went out and bought a special dessert and was making a vegetarian dinner and everything.  N. lies to my face, and goes over to M.'s after school without ever talking to me. Fine. We were never really close anyway. But you. You. We were *supposed to be* friends. You had treated me like crap, I had taken it, and you promised to change once again (Oh how many times had I heard that before). I thought that you would care enough to show up on my birthday. But no. You said you were coming all the way up to when we got to my house. And then I got out, turned around, and you drove away without an explanation. This was definitely not the first time you had cancelled on a plan to hang out. You had literally cancelled every one of our plans except things that involved a group project and one sleepover with J. in tenth grade. But to not show up to my birthday party when you were the only one invited for no reason? You must be stone cold. And now every time I make plans I still get that nagging worry that nobody will show up. Because of you. \n\nI will never send this to you. Because unlike you, I care about people's feelings and I don't like to destroy people, even if they are you. I wish I could hate you, but I don't. I wish I could despise you, but I know for my sake *not yours* that I need to move on and try to forgive. \nSo Congratulations R.! You successfully made half of my high school social life a roller coaster of emotional pain. You can suck it at ___ because I am going to fricking ___ . And I get to live the rest of my life knowing that you will be jealous of me because I made it out of state and I am going to best school for ______ in the entire nation, no the world. But that is not why I will win. I will devote my life to helping others and raising a family and to making my corner of the world a little better while you smash toys together and make people break while you pursue money in a cycle of misery that will never end because it will never be enough. And I still wish you the best, and I pray for myself to be able to fully forgive you, and I pray that you can be happy and that you will be able to change. And that is why I will win. \n___Tldr: A rant against someone who has truly hurt me. Just read it, or at least the last paragraph.___"

            "value": "So I'm a college student who recently is completing my final semester of school. Our school required us to do an internship placement as part of our school credit.\n\nWe have a neat sub-domain of our school's website where potential internship\u200b employers can post \"ads\" to recruit students for internships. In each ad is a description of the job, required duties, and whether or not you will be compensated financially.\n\nI found a few good internships, but the decision came down to 2 of them; one interested me more but didn't offer any compensation, and another one interested me a bit less BUT said I would be paid at a bi-weekly rate.\n\nI chose the latter because money is money and I had just recently moved out on my own. \n\nNow, I had come to the main office of the employer in late November to discuss the details. During the interview he went through what I'd do, what days I'd be there, etc. Finally what came up was what I would be paid.\n\nHe said that I would be paid every 2 weeks (much like a regular job). He also seemed pretty laid back, which I thought at the time would be a perk to working there. Turns out his casualness is what ended up fucking me over.\n\nNow it's January, and I'm starting my internship. At the second day in my internship, he brings up my pay again. He says he has never had an internship student before and therefore doesn't know the finer details behind it; this mostly means he doesn't know what rate to pay me. \n\nHe says he will email my professor to ask what he should pay me. My professor replies punctually within the hour and says \"Since he is an intern, you technically don't have to pay him anything. But (college) would appreciate and encourage employers to pay their intern students\".\n\nThis is all very true. You don't have to pay an intern. Technically, I am getting work experience in the field and that's \"good enough\". I'll come back to this in a second.\n\nFirst two weeks go by and I'm given a check for $200. Pretty decent I guess, I only work there 3 days a week for about 3 hours a day. So it works out to be minimum wage. Still, I am grateful because some students aren't even being compensated at all.\n\nNow, the pay has been stable until maybe the second month. One week he decides to give me $150 because apparently some of his clients had fallen through and therefore, he wasn't making as much money. I had known this was a bullshit excuse but in my head I thought not to argue it because I was being paid in the first place where others weren't.\n\nNot to mention within the first month he had said there was potential to be hired afterwards. So I took the -$50 deduction for the sake of not upsetting him so I could get hired after.\n\nThe paychecks after that are the required $200. One of them goes to $150 again. I get upset about it internally but move past it.\n\nAnother one goes to $150. It sucks. But now here's the kicker.\n\nI complete my final two weeks at the internship. At the end of the day, I wait for my paycheck as usual. He comes up to me after a bit and says \"Financials are kind of up in the air right now because I just paid $2000 to get new locks, cameras, etc. for the building. Text me tomorrow and maybe you can drop by and we'll talk.\"\n\nNow one more thing to add here; our relationship is casual. I'm 20 and he's 29, we fist bump when I come into work, we shoot the shit every now and then, he swears openly about stuff and I do too, it's all very casual. Once when he suggested I pick up my paycheck on the next Monday, I sort of hesitated to say \"Alright sounds good\" because truly it wasn't good. He noticed and said \"Oh, what, were you planning on going out this weekend?\". I said Yes and he said \"Alright\" and wrote me my check.\n\nThis makes me a bit upset because coincidentally, I have my one year anniversary dinner with my girlfriend that weekend and really needed the cash. I became a bit physically disheartened, sort of like the other time I just mentioned where he wanted to pay me later; and he noticed it again. I explained I was going for dinner but he still insisted I come the next day. I agreed, we fist bumped, I left.\n\nLater that day I received a notification from my professor that our final internship reports were due in 4 days. These are what our bosses do (short checklist of how we performed) when we're done.\n\nI texted my boss immediately after and notified him about it. Word for word I said:\n\n>ME: Hey (Name) would you be able to do that  internship thing I mentioned before sometime today?\n\n> HIM: Send it over and I'll do it\n\n>ME: Which email should I send it to\n\n>HIM: (provides email)\n\n>ME: Sent it. Thanks!\n\nHe didn't do it that day (Day 1). I waited until Day 3 to text him again.\n\n>ME: Hey (name), just wanted to know if you had filled in the internship thing yet.\n\n>Wish i didnt have to bother you with it but the school requires it.\n\nI received no reply. It's now the day it's due and Good Friday. I don't want to keep bothering him and email my professor telling her I'll have to give it to her Monday after I come into work.\n\nKeep in mind I still haven't been paid yet.\n\nOn Easter Sunday I text him:\n\n>ME: Hey man its a bit late (my bad spent easter with family) but am I coming i to work tomorrow?\n\n>Not sure what your plans were for easter monday. Anyways ill assume i am coming though \n\nI didn't know if he would close shop and spend time with his family so I awaited a text. Still nothing. I wake up the next morning and still no text, but I still come into work.\n\n**Now THIS is the fucked up climax.**\n\nAbout an hour into working I ask him if he was busy this weekend. He said he wasn't. He said that he didn't text me back purposely.\n\nI was confused here and asked why? And he said \"Well when you left work last week and I said I couldn't pay you that day, it kind of rubbed me the wrong way\"\n\nI apologized that it did, and being that our relationship is casual and he told me to speak my mind, I said \"There is a possibility I was a bit upset about it but wouldn't you be too?\"\n\nThis discussion went on for about an hour.\n\nHe admitted to me \"I didn't text you or give you that report to test you.\"\n\nHe explained that he thought I was upset that he didn't pay me, so I was just trying to quickly get my internship report done and never talk to him again. He thought that once he was done with the report, I would have no reason to come in anymore and I would leave the projects I was working on unfinished.\n\nI told him I would never do that, especially considering he had offered me contrived work after my internship was done. Which makes sense, I want to work for him because I want money.\n\nI am very hesitant during this whole thing. Up until this point I had thought less about this guy as my boss and more of my friend. So to discuss pay in this fashion is kind of awkward. \n\nAnyways though, I finally came out and stopped beating around the bush like he said and asked him \"So am I getting paid for the last 2 weeks I was here?\" and he said \"I can't\".\n\nThis led to a pretty civil argument about why he should pay me.\n\nMy argument was he told me in November when he hired me the pay I would be given, and that means it is a stable pay rate and you can't alter my pay a month after you make an obligation to me because you feel like it.\n\nHis argument was that because my professor said he doesn't have to pay me anything, I am lucky I was being paid in the first place and he also cited a 2 times he paid for my lunch and once drove me 2 blocks to my bus stop as reasons why I should be content with not being paid the final 2 weeks.\n\nHe also said a client fell through and that along with the fees for the locks and cameras was why he couldn't pay me. I told him that an employer is supposed to pay their employee for work they've done no matter what. \n\nLosing $50 maybe 3 times I could sort of deal with, but I felt I was being flat out robbed $200 worth of my time.\n\nHe also said \"I've been paying you with paychecks this whole time and not properly getting invoices so this might end up costing me even more with taxes\"\n\nI didn't say this part, but fucking REALLY dude? I am your employee, it isn't my fucking job to figure out how you are supposed to pay people and do business related shit. \n\nAll around it was fucking dumb.\n\nBy the end of the argument I had swayed him to pay me. But he said \"Now this shit is all fucked up\" and I asked what he meant by that, and he said he was referring to us. This very obviously implied him hiring me to do more work in the summer.\n\nSo now I'm fucking angry and want to tell him he's a shitty business owner, a shitty boss, and a fucking moron. But I can't because I still MAYBE have a chance to work for him in the future. If he does and fucks me over again, I don't know what I'll do. But at this point I have bills to pay and have no choice. \n\nI'm fucking ANGRY.\n\nTL;DR: I encouraged you to read the full thing because it's absolutely fucking dumb, but basically: \n\nBoss hired me at a specific pay rate, months later said I technically shouldn't be paid and therefore refused to pay me for work I already did. Said that the fact that I brought the whole thing up and argued my case \"fucked shit (our relationship) up\" and now I may not be hired by him to do more work."

The job he is quiting now he has for almost a month and he was supposed to work 3 days a week, but after 1 day of working he said that he was going to drop it down to 2 days. And now he is quiting because he keeps getting \"sick\" and has no time to get school done. (Which is all online)\n\nAs for money. He has to pay me a whomping $30 a month for child support. At first he wanted me to get it back to him but now he realizes that was a stupid request. But he can go visit his girlfriend almost every weekend who is 4 hours away (Which probably cost at least $30 in gas.) And they are going on vacation this weekend to a big city, which I know isn't cheap. \n\nThen he likes to go on with how privileged I am. How I got school paid for and that I get WIC and other assistance ... I just finished up my degree (Which took me less then a year to get.) And I'm hired to start working in a few weeks. And I was figuring how much I'd be making vs cost of living. I'd be lucky to have maybe $200 left over, if I didn't live with my parents. (I've very grateful for them.)

But he can go visit his girlfriend and go on vacation, where I'm happy to get a shower longer then 10 minute without interrupts. \n\nI guess my main purpose in this post is for everyone else to see him as a lazy piece of shit.

But I\u2019ve also always hated echo chambers where people just circle jerk each other about who hates Trump the most. I still do, but I get it now.\n \nYou see, I\u2019m Puerto Rican. My mother was born in PR and moved stateside when she was 8 with her family. Most of my relatives moved to the states too but we still have a lot of relatives on the island. Plus, me and my family would visit almost every year (we actually just got back from a trip like two months ago). \nBut I don\u2019t LOOK Puerto Rican. My dad is white, and I look more white than anything. My last name is German. I don\u2019t speak much Spanish. Nothing about me would indicate that I am Puerto Rican. So I\u2019ve never experienced any sort of prejudice, racism, or any other social issues associated with being a minority. My mom had to deal with that when she was younger, so I\u2019m sure her and my dad made sure I wouldn\u2019t have to go through that (but I\u2019m sure looking white probably helped). \nI guess I\u2019m trying to paint a picture here. I\u2019m a Puerto Rican man, but I look white. And since social issues never affected me really, I never truly cared. I\u2019d like to believe I\u2019m more liberal than not, and while I\u2019ve always shown my support for most social issues (racism, sexism, poverty, etc.), because none of those issues never really affected me. So I remember last year I was in my room with my roommate (at the time), my (former) friend, and my (now-but-not-then) girlfriend. We were watching the election. Of course, we all expected Hillary to win. I may have fucking HATED Hillary, but I thought that Trump would be a worse leader. By the end of the night we were all shocked. Everyone in the room was crying. Except for me. I was standing there confused as to why someone would get this upset over this. I know he\u2019s the president now but like how much is that actually going to interfere with our lives? Actually, I was even a little glad that Hillary lost, because her and her supports were so smug about winning. I got an air that Trump was elected as a big middle finger to the government, which I thought was funny. But anyway, back to the story. The next few days my campus was filled with people who were fearing for their lives or said \u201cHow can the people who voted for Trump not be an asshole?\u201d This one bothered me, because I didn\u2019t think voting for or supporting Trump made you an asshole. I just thought you: A. were Republican or B. just wanted something to \u201cshake up politics.\u201d But now I get it. I can\u2019t respect anyone who says they continue to support Trump. \nPuerto Rico is fucking awful right now. I got lucky, and my family is ok. My Abuela was in PR for Irma, but made it out before Maria hit. Most of my relatives have left the island and are staying with family in the states. We only know about one death. It was one of my great aunts. She was in the hospital and died during the storm. There\u2019s no way to know if she died on her own or the storm cutting power resulted in her death, but she was in her 90\u2019s, hooked up to an oxygen tank, and beginning to suffer from dementia, and while every death is sad, she was on her way out. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s counted among Maria\u2019s death toll. But others weren\u2019t so lucky. PR has basically been reduced to a third world country. \nTrumps response to Maria was abhorrent. I\u2019ve never been so disgusted. He has done almost NOTHING to help. He probably wouldn\u2019t have sent any aid workers had someone not reminded him. And then he goes and plays golf? Wow thanks man that trophy you won really fucking helped. And then he has the audacity to go on twitter and rant against the mayor of San Juan, who was actively searching for missing people after Maria? And furthermore, he said that Puerto Ricans aren\u2019t doing enough to help themselves? Fuck that. Puerto Ricans are some of the most generous and hard working people I have ever met. They wouldn\u2019t think twice about helping their neighbor. The citizens of Puerto Rico are likely doing more to assist themselves then anything he\u2019s done. But apparently wanting disaster relief after a fucking hurricane is \u201cexpecting others to do your work.\u201d \nNot only that, but now, just like everything having to do with Trump, it got politicized. On both sides of the spectrum there was so much bullshit, and misinformation, and toxicity about PR. But this isn\u2019t a fucking political situation. This is a people-are-fucking-dying situation. Our president is a piece of shit. So focus your efforts into helping PR instead of blasting Trump. And to people who agree with/support Trump, like I said before asking for help after a fucking hurricane isn\u2019t \u201cexpecting others to do your work.\u201d \nI never thought that an issue like this would affect me. So I guess there\u2019s a bit of a moral to this story. I guess you really can\u2019t understand someone until you\u2019re in a similar situation. I\u2019m still going to avoid echo chambers, and I\u2019ll never act hostile towards someone with different beliefs. But when I see someone who is so heated about a social issue, I\u2019ll get it. \n\nThis post wasn\u2019t made to get people to help out PR, but if you could donate or volunteer at any sort of relief effort the people of PR really need it. I know Lin-Manuel Miranda just released a song a la \u201cWe are the World\u201d style, so you can look into that. "

And because they've been pretty sketchy with me before I feel like this was on purpose. \n\n I'm really eager to get out of this complex.  I found a great apartment that's the same amount of rent and about twice the space (yay my son will have his own room!) and closer to babysitters and work and all around perfect.  I go to give them my thirty day notice to vacate today and find out when I signed the new lease they tacked on an extra month.  I didn't even think to check the date, i swear if I had noticed the date was changed I would have insisted they change it back.  So now for the month of May I will have two apartments, and double the rent, which I can't really afford.  Can I use the single mom card real quick?  There goes my diaper money!  I feel so duped.

He mutters a, \"sorry\" and proceeds to just keep on doing what he's doing. LIKE WHAT THE FAAAAKKK. I was annoyed instantly.

So basically as we went through this before the man insisted he was my grandfather and I explained everything to the lawyer he told the man to leave or he will be brought to court. The man left as I would assume he was afraid of being charged, I thought the problem was solved but he ended up just going out for a bite to eat.

Women are supposed to be treated like delicate flowers, but it's okay for all women to completely shit all over men, and as men, we're all supposed to \"man up\" and take it and expect to be okay with it, right? Well, it's NOT okay!\n\nAll I've ever wanted in life is for what pretty much EVERY. Other. Fucking. Human. Being. ...Has in this life: love, family, friends, respect, a partner, opportunities, chances, etc.\n\nBut no. I was fucked over completely, yet I'm not \"allowed\" to complain about it because 'no one likes a Negative Nancy.\" What kind of fucking self-perpetuating cycle is that? I was created to be some slimy, short, undesirable manlet that NO decent woman would ever find attractive, yet I'm supposed to be happy, anyway? Happy that I'll literally *never* be loved my entire life? Happy that I'm supposed to \"create my own happiness\" from the black hole that is my life? Happy that women (and men) treat me like shit simply because of *the way I look*? Happy that the very, very *best* I can hope for in a partner is some fucked-up ratchet bitch who treats men like an ATM and has a foul mouth and 9 kids before she's 25 and take that with a smile, assuming I can even ever get *that* kind of woman? Seriously?!?\n\nAnytime a man like me is alone and suffering, they'll always be some feminist cunt to come along and make it all about her, or try to paint the man as some kind of \"misogynist\" or \"sex-crazed, fedora-wearing, neckbeard, Nice Guy^tm. \" When all you're asking for is love and acceptance, not some hole to fuck on the weekends. How fucked up is society where just WANTING to be loved by a good woman makes you an asshole, yet these same slimy fucked up cunts will go around treating men like garbage?\n\nI'm so sick of hearing this shit. I'm so sick of lonely men, who EVERYONE has rejected, being relegated to being horny assholes. Women rarely have this problem because women rarely ever get lonely. A typical woman under 35 can choose any number of men she wants. For them though, they're not \"good enough.\" And I can understand not wanting the worst-of-the-worst; that's fine. But no woman is ever *lonely* by circumstance; there's PLENTY of men on any given day she can have, even if they aren't the \"right\" ones. But why can't *men* be afforded this luxury also? Other than the nature of how our species works and the fact that since men can't give birth to babies, we're all relegated to worker drones and used to be disposable tools in our society. Why do some men just **have** to be lonely and accept dying alone? Especially because they're *too-fucking-short*? Or because they're \"the wrong race?\" Seriously?!?\n\nI don't hate women. I don't. But I do hate these bullshit games and this \"selective process\" where women can dismiss a man and treat him like complete shit because he's under 6'1\". Or because he's any other race but White. Or because he's not a fucking multi-billionaire. Or because he doesn't have blue eyes, or isn't left-handed, or doesn't own a motorcycle, or any of this other shit! The worst any woman has to deal with is being overweight. And don't get me wrong; that shit isn't cool either; to have men tell you you're worthless because you weigh 165. But why is it *so wrong* in our society to reject women or ever treat them badly, but *so damn accepted* to openly and unapologetically reject men and treat them like utter shit? Shouldn't it be that treating *anyone* horribly should be seen as an awful thing in our society? But no; shit all over a man and it's a-okay! Do something that a woman dislikes even marginally and you're beaten half to death by *both* sexes and thrown in jail. All because she has a clitoris and a womb. It's not just \"treat *everyone* with some fucking decency and respect,\" men included.\n\nYou wonder how these [Elliot Rodgers and Seung-Hui Cho's and Adam Lanza's and Ivan Lopez's and James Holmes'](http://nypost.com/2014/06/01/why-psychiatrists-fail-in-stopping-mass-killers/) are created? It's from society being complete pieces of shit to people; some women, but mostly men. Nobody WANTS to go crazy and do some crazy shit. But this is what society has come to. When all you want is a little love and compassion from the world and every single day, they tell you to fuck off and go die. It's just like that [overrated, fucking song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3N1MlvVc4). It's madness.\n\nIn the end though, you end up being an actual hero for *not* going crazy and shooting up some place, and just sacrificing yourself and your sanity and happiness for the good of the world that doesn't give a shit about you and will leave you to rot, sad and alone. Only no one else will ever know how brave you are for enduring a life of loneliness, depression, and psychological torture. They won't celebrate you or  give you a medal for literally not going crazy in circumstances where that'd be pretty easy. Nope. The world will just keep on spinning and you'll keep on being treated like shit and living a lonely life that literally nothing you do will ever change, whether you're just too short and ugly for people to like you, or not.\n\nAll of us in this situation will just continue to pretend to be these shiny happy people who aren't dead inside and will literally NEVER know love. And the fact that we don't go apeshit and kill a bunch of people simply makes us \"*lesser*\" assholes than if we did. \n\nWelcome to the fucking dystopia of life we call 2015 humanity. Where the world treats you like utter shit, especially if you're male, and you just have to endure it or put a bullet in your head. And no one will give two shits, either way."

I worked on practice test questions after each lesson and ingrained them in my head all night. I wrote objective functions and constraints until my hand hurt. \n\nWe're always given the entire class period to finish the exam (which is an hour and a half), so I ask my ride to pick me up in an hour and a half. \n\nBUT.\n\nAfter an hour and twenty eight minutes, not a single person has left the classroom- no one has finished the exam, including me. \n\nFor WHATEVER reason, we're given three times the number of questions we're normally given on exams. In addition, this is a linear programming exam (so lots and lots of steps for each problem.) \n\nAn hour and a half has passed, class is over meaning we're now out of time- so I expect the Professor to cut us all short (meaning we'd all likely fail). Start collecting our exams and whatnot. \n\nOh but no. IN FACT, he just sits there. Class has \"ended\", but he sits at his desk continuing his work. He doesn't say a single word. We assume this means we have extra time (beyond class time) to finish the exam. \n\nWhich is great and all except, I already told my ride I'd be done in an hour and a half (since, oh I don't know, AN HOUR AND A HALF CLASS PERIOD IS ALWAYS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME ALOTTED FOR EXAMS) \n\nAdditionally, half of the class HAVE OTHER CLASSES to go to. \n\nBecause no one knew we would be given extra time to complete the exam if necessary (because he didn't tell us he would extend the allotted time!!): half of us are scrambling to get to our other appointments that we ALREADY MADE/ other classes we must attend.\n\nMeaning the other half of the class that coincidentally have NOTHING else planned for today get to ace the exam (or at least finish it.)\n\nMeanwhile, students who actually understand the material have no choice but to flunk with a partly finished exam- \n\nbecause they went ahead and scheduled things. \n\nBECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW HE WOULD EXTEND THE CLASS PERIOD.\n\nBECAUSE HE DOESN'T TELL THE CLASS ANYTHING.  \n\nI want to scream. While other kids had scheduled classes to attend and couldn't NOT go to them, I could've at least texted my ride and let them know what was going on, so they could wait a bit while I finish my exam. But of course we're not allowed to use our phones, nor did I want to ask my professor.\n\nSo in the end, it didn't matter how hard I studied or how well I knew the material (I knew it inside and out). The exam was obviously too long for all of us to finish by an hour and a half- yet I was one of the few who couldn't use the allotted time.\n\nI couldn't check my answers (which is crucial for a linear programming exam because you can't make a single mistake) nor could I even start on several questions. I had to practically rush the last few I did before having to leave.\n\nI think it's bothering me more because we pay for this class out of pocket. So out of guilt (since it's so expensive), I try to get good grades to make the expense worth it. \n\nBut I couldn't even finish a stupid exam after putting my all into it for the past month. The grading system for this class relies VERY heavily on exams. (It's made up of attendance + exams only.) \n\nI had no choice but to miss two weeks of class because my grandfather had a surgery (and my parents insisted I come up with them to visit him.) so I was hoping to at least do well on the exams, even though the syllabus claims I'll barely pass if I miss more than 3-4 classes.\n\nI was doing well. I was getting 100%'s on my past exams. But I know I flunked this one. I'm so pissed. "

I'm talking easily 20+ years old pieces of utter crap that are so loud they could wake the dead. And of 3 units on the ground floor, they're located directly beneath ours as well which does not help things. Now during daytime hours fine, but we've repeatedly had assholes start theirs around 8:30-9 at night which means in total it runs until well after midnight. They're not supposed to do that; all laundry activity is supposed to stop at 10pm according to the leasing agreement. We tried to tell the front office, their response was to tell us they'd put up signs saying no laundry after 10 (which they did not, by the way) and they could do nothing further. We called the police on a noise complaint, but since it's coming from a 'communal space' instead of a specific unit they can't do anything either. We know what unit it is, as someone else in our building (we're thinking our direct neighbors) keeps going downstairs and unplugging the machines if they run past about 10:15 and as I went to toss out trash around 11 one night with the drier still running and they were waiting to see if they could catch who was still unplugging their machines. They accused us, of course, and said that they'd been doing their laundry after hours for over a year before we moved in with no complaints from anyone about it. Not counting that the people next door moved in a month after we did, of course. But all we can really do is deal with it and try to block out the noise, since either no one has power to stop them or they're not willing to use said power to do anything about it.\n\nSecond, we got new people in the apartment above us back at the end of October. It's been nothing but noise out of them 24/7. If it's not their music so loud we can hear it in our apartment is their television, or the two of them arguing very loudly. I tried going up there, knocking on their door and asking them to keep it down. I get it, some people just don't understand their own loudness. Except that they never answered the door/outright ignored me. So we told the front office time and time again, especially when they were being that loud past quiet hours. They basically tried to appease us by calling the people and telling them to keep it down, but that didn't work and when we kept complaining they told us that all they're authorized to say anymore is that we need to call the police. I've personally called the police six times on a noise complaint and twice on a possible domestic based on the amount of yelling followed by thumps and bumps and bangs coming from their place. Also called animal control twice for their dog barking for upwards of an hour straight and for possible animal abuse because their dog is literally skin and bones. Animal control finally took the dog earlier this morning, but they have not faced any legal trouble or arrests or anything. This includes that all six times on the noise complaint we invited the officers in to our unit to let them hear the noise at 11pm, midnight, and beyond. They seem to have stopped, finally, but it's fucking annoying that they've faced nothing for being such loud assholes that it was literally preventing us from sleeping through most of November while we were trying to sort things out with the office and the police and such.\n\nAnd of course, we went to pay our rent yesterday (the 4th). The office has this stupid fucking policy where you can't pay the rent before the 1st of the month, but the 1st through the 3rd my roommate and I were at a craft show trying to actually do our damn jobs and make enough money to pay rent from the time before the office was open until after it closed. He even called them on the 1st and asked if we could pay rent on the 4th when we'd actually be home and was told sure. But he went to do that and had to pay a 'late fee' that was almost half our rent amount because we didn't pay it on the 1st. The lady who told him he could pay it on the 4th without penalty denied saying so, and said we'd be evicted on the spot if we didn't pay the penalty. Which is money we don't really have, and we had to dig into our savings to get it settled which was something we try to avoid doing at all costs if we can.\n\nJust....this whole place sucks balls. The office staff don't care about anything but money, they will lie to your face about things, and if you're having problems at all unless it compromises the structure or look of a unit (like the time we had a leak in the hall shower that was going into the basement and causing mold behind the walls) they drop the ball and don't send a guy out for months, if at all so we've had to live with several 'non essential' things broken like the one bathroom door so off it takes practically kicking it open to do so if it's closed more than a little and another door so loose in the frame it won't latch at all and the slightest breeze will blow it open like it doesn't have a knob to begin with.\n\nAnd of course now we know they're just pissed at us for raising a fuss and refusing to let people get away with being dumb, and of course we turned in our official notice not to renew our lease not too long ago since we don't plan on staying here and will be looking for a new place before our lease is up so now they're just milking us for everything they can get before we leave. I've already left them horrid reviews on any site I can find them on, though, and I've been editing those reviews accordingly as new shit happens to us. The least I can do is hopefully make sure people are informed about this shithole and avoid living here if at all possible."

I have spend countless hours selling and emailing and hiring 2 commission only sales people. The result? Nothing. No money. No gas. Months behind on my utilities and very nearly 2 months behind in rent. If I wasn't a 40yr old single mother, with 2 small kids starting back to school in 2 weeks, it would be easier. \nToday, my 8 yr old told me a story about summer camp. One of the kids was talking about going to Disneyland and how they are planning on a cruise. She said \"We can't do that stuff because my Mom only has $12.\" \nI yelled at her for it. I felt/feel absolutely terrible for getting angry. I hate that I told her to NEVER talk about how much money we have or don't have with others. \nI hate that I can't afford to take them to the movies, or out to dinner, or shoe shopping for school. I hate that they will not have new clothes for school. \nI hate that they will be on the free lunch program. And that my oldest can't have seconds, because they charge for that and I can't afford it. I hate that paying for gas to go to work uses up nearly 50% of what I've made in the last 3 months. \nMy X hasn't paid a dime in child support since October. It is not court ordered and he works for himself, so no way to collect. He makes no effort to talk to them or skype or write. And he lives thousands of miles away, so no visits or 'every other weekend'. \nMy bf is a good guy and I love him, but I will not every marry him or live with him. He has no interest in being a 'step-dad' and I won't put my kids through what I went through with our step dad. (Not abuse, just horrible neglect. Growing up knowing that our 'Dad' doesn't like kids and didn't ever want to spend any time with us. Ever.) \nMy bf went with his oldest brother to surgery this week. His brother had his testicles removed, due to cancer. My bf has a growth/cyst/tumor on his testicle that is being 'tested'. He will most likely have to have his testicles removed this year. He is only 39 yrs old. \nOne night recently, my bf and I were cuddling and he was gently rubbing my back. He found a growth/cyst/who.fucking.knows under my skin, near my shoulderblade. Now I have to go get it tested. GREAT!! \nI am terrified of being evicted. Of having my utilities turned off. Of my girls growing up 'poor'. I have a solid 9 days until I get any more food assistance (yes, I qualify for foodstamps. I made $16k last year. All year. And less than $1000 a month this year). I have virtually no food in the house and will most likely have to use the Food Pantry to get through the week. \nEvery day, I work. Because I work for myself, most of those hours are unpaid. My entire business was built on the idea \"If you help enough other people get what they want in life, you will get every thing you want.\" Zig Ziglar.  I am angry because it has not worked! Helping others has done nothing but put me further in the hole. \nI am angry because I have applied for over 30 jobs in the last 20 days and had 2 interviews. I could not accept either job because the hours were over 50 a week, commission only, nights and weekends, and childcare would cost me more money than I would make. Especially if I made no sales. It would be just like right now! Paying to go to work and making nothing. Negative dollars. \nI am angry, because I am usually so happy and optimistic that when others are having problems or looking for a job, they turn to me for help. They never ask if I am ok. It is just assumed I am. \nI'm angry at Facebook for making stupidity a sideshow. For making it obvious who among my beloved friends and family are actually judgmental, hypocritical bigots. \nI'm angry at whoever took those girls in Evansdale, Iowa (very close to me) because it has made my whole community loose their ever loving mind! People are scared and scared people are stupid and LOUD! \nI'm angry at the moron on FB who called me a \"dumbass\" because he disagreed with me, but of course, all his posts had terrible spelling and grammar. \nI'm angry at the redditors who downvoted my first post ever, but didn't bother to answer the question asked, or disagree with me and post why. Just run around downvoting people. Hope it makes you feel like the 'better' person.... \nI'm angry at myself for not taking better care of myself. I haven't ran and listened to my music for weeks. I drink too much and eat too much fatty food. I ate 1/2 lb of bacon yesterday morning and drank 2 French press pots of coffee. My pants are tight and its my fault. \nI'm angry at politics and politicians. I am not happy that the best our country can come up with are Obama and Romney. I campaigned for Obama. I was a Precinct captain, a caucus leader and a local, district and state delegate. His decisions since being elected make me angry enough to scream!! But then, I remember, that Mitt is so much worse... \nI'm happy I have reddit. But then, I realize, the more time I spend on Reddit, the angrier I become. smh.... \n\nTL;DR. Life sucks. Rant on Reddit. "

FUCK YOU!!\n\nI support 5500 of you people - ALONE!! No Help!! When I need help, my managers state they don't have any to give, that's assuming I can find time to ASK for it in an e-mail and assuming the buggy e-mail program you make actually SENDS it!\n\nDaily I have to resort to giving myself kidney stones with massive doses of Caffine to stay awake to keep supporting you while my wife calls every 5 minutes to ask when I'm coming home so you can have your stupid \"work stoppage\" of the external monitor connected to your laptop not working - have you ever heard of the scaling feature? USE IT!\n\nHow about when I tell you there are over 40 people with the same issue! I'm a MAN, not a GOD!  I can only be in one place at once, and honestly, I don't give a fuck if you DO need to leave at noon to have a three drink lunch with your buddies you watch Netflix and game on company time with!  Only for me to later have to deal with you drunk while I try and order parts for your out-of-warranty piece of shit computer that should bave been replaced in the refresh 5 years ago but you just don't want to do it because you have a picture of your 3 now nine year old daughter on it!\n\nI have to leave late because of you (to compensate for all of what WOULD be Overtime if it were approved), and I have to come in EARLY because of you!  I have to answer up to my bosses weekly because you were angry that the Coffee machine is down and decided to take it out on the I.T. guy in a survey or email to management!  Nevermind that the company expects YOU to do your imaging, and expects YOU to be competent enough at running a computer to find the Excel Icon or the power button!  Nevermind that your pampered full-time god-status warrants you complain to me because I did not answer your e-mail in 5 minutes after you called the idiots in India to try and \"fix\" your computer - what did you expect, them to teleport to your office and replace your failing hard disk?  This is your JOB - not World of Warcraft!  This is life!  You are no more special than anyone else!\n\nAnd to the fuckin' techs around me that I ask for help on things, you TELL me to ask when I'm stumped, which is very rarely - I've become pretty good at being the lone wolf on this team as much as people have ignored me for the past four years - but then when I ask, you either don't reply or tell me the SAME EXACT FUCKING TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS I ALREADY FUCKING DID!!! I WOULD NOT BE COMING TO YOU FOR HELP IF I HAD NOT DONE THEM ALREADY!!! Yet when you have a problem, I'm always the first one to reply with relevant information and get you guys unstuck in a timely manner, and it's always a stupider, easier, literally in the process manual question compared to my clusterfuck questions!  I'm sick of it!\n\nTo a specific person - FUCK YOU! I trained you, and now you stab me in the back and turn my supervisors against me - why don't you take that three wheeled trike you rode in on and shove it up your fat, greasy asshole!  You're dead to me!\n\nI feel hated, unappreciated, and like I just don't matter to the so-called \"Team\"!  One minute you say something is \"out of scope\" the next it's \"just do whatever makes the client happy!\" - well, which is it going to fucking be?  We have standard processes, why does only a handful follow them, and the rest have their own?  It's fucking confusing and irritating!\n\nNeedless to say, I will start looking for employment ELSEWHERE today, because I AM better than this, and am worth the better pay! Apparently I also have the skillset of a Server Admin, Systems Analyst, and Network Admin as I've been having to leech into their line of work off/on for the past 4 years to keep my 5000+ clients happy as well despite being out of scope because nobody will help me when I'm stumped - including those that NEED TO BE!  I Swear, this job is helping bring back my suicidal tendencies and killing my soul!  My family is already pestering me - problem is, it's for a reputable place, so now those fuckers want me to stay in the same place doing something else - how the FUCK do I do that?  Most Job Roles require college education in different fields of study, ones I have not pursued!\n\nThis is NOT how I.T. should be - your employees should be experienced enough in their tasks to do their jobs without having to ask people all the time, our scope should be CLEARLY outlined enough and simply enough without leading to debates when something weird comes up!  Our end users should understand they are not the only techs and we should not have one tech working for as many users as I do....alone!  I've had to take time out of my busy day today to rant this down in 10 minutes so I don't punch someone in the face before the day is over!\n\nTo the select few who appreciate me bending over backwards and being nice, thanks, for you make this place just barely bearable day in and day out for me, and that's why I do it for you.  I wish there were more like you two or three people.\n\n~sigh"

After waiting a fucking hour for the \"Preparing for installation\" bar to fuck off, it downloaded, installed and requested a restart. Alright, fine, I'll restart. After another hour of update installation, the computer starts up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nImmediately, Windows 10 pops up with a message: We've uninstalled ESET NOD32 antivirus as it's not compatible with Windows 10.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou motherfucker.

Went on the ESET website, navigated through their piece of shit UI which is supposed to be all hip and cool and shit, when in reality it's a clusterfuck of huge images covering 90% of usable space on the page, trying to sell me a license I already own, got to the license retrieval page, waited ten minutes for them to send the goddamned email with the key, downloaded the anti-virus, installed and activated.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#I thought I was done. I was so fucking wrong.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEvery file has been associated with Microsoft's shitty programs. Flac files? Fuck you. MP3s? Fuck you. JPEGs? Fuck you. Everything has been changed to their stupid programs. I have to go through every goddamned audio file extension and switch it to Foobar2000, go through every image file extension and switch it to whatever the fuck I used before and do this to all other extensions which I forgot about.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGod dammit. Fuck you Microsoft. The only reason I use your operating system is because it's the least shitty of the incredibly shitty choices we as consumers have. And yes, Linux is shitty too. Fuck you, angry Ridiot slamming on his keyboard keys. No, I won't use Linux. GIMP isn't even remotely close to Photoshop. No, I won't fuck with WINE. No, I don't want to deal with a 1980s terminal window. That shit should stay in the past. I want a usable UI, Metal Gear, Witcher and the entirety of the Adobe Creative Suite installed natively. At least Microsoft has the courtesy to fuck me occasionally, rather than have a barebones operating system where every fucking move I make somehow doesn't function and I need to type some gibberish into a fucking console after a three-hour Google searching spree.\n\n***Fuck***"

It's never enough. \n\nYou left home before graduating and got pregnant and moved back home. Of course we took you in. You are our daughter. Now a baby needs taking care of. We bought clothes, made car payments, we were babysitters. You had everything given to you that you could need. No rent to pay, no, food to buy. You had it made. \n\n    What did you do? You treated us like garbage, me especially. I don't know why. You are an angry human being to the core. You were emotionally and verbally abusive to me as time went on. In my face screaming at me. The family wouldn't leave me alone with you it got so bad. I tried to sooth your frightened  2 yr old child as she trembled and clung to me as you went after your brother one day. Screaming and raging. She was so frightened and so tiny in my arms. \n\n   Can't kick you out there is a child involved. Plus it would be held over our heads like every other self perceived injustice to you. You were always controlling me and those around you by threatening to take the little one and leave.\n \n   You told me I wasn't allowed to talk to someone and that's when I said enough is enough. I called your bluff. And you took her and left and wouldn't let me even talk to her on the phone. \n\n  Do you know what we call you? We call you \"miasma\". Because of your abuse, I become physically ill when you come near me. \n    The only good thing to ever come from you is that child. For something so sweet and pure to come from such an evil person is a true miracle. \n\n  I hate you more every time my heart aches from missing her. I hate you for all the tears I've shed because of you. I hate you for all the family get togethers I will never have because of you. If I were on my death bed I would not want you near me. You will never know anything more about me. I don't wish anything bad upon you. Those things have a way of working out on their own. You will one day regret your actions and words. But I can take no more from you. I don't want you to be my daughter anymore. "

Deranged, profanity-laced rant proceeds:\n\nSo in the midst of getting an assignment done and getting ready for a test that afternoon, my wife is informed by her doctor - the chimpanzees at the student health clinic at her university - that they wouldn't be able to renew her prescription - for medicine that maintains the chemical makeup of her brain - this week, as the doctor wanted to 'ask her some questions' about her ongoing condition - but the dipshit wouldn't be back in the clinic until Tuesday. When she asked how she was supposed to do any coursework over the weekend and attend lectures next week with brain zaps, headaches, confusion and fatigue, they just repeated to come in on Tuesday.\n\nSo she, now facing the possibility of not having her medicine for five days, had to put that worry aside to hurriedly finish her project due that day, then we spent $90 and three hours waiting at a walk-in clinic to get a new prescription for it, time which would have been better spent studying for her test that afternoon. We eventually had to leave so she could take her test, but when we returned they saw us almost immediately. And big thanks to the doctor for quickly filling the prescription and sending us to the chemist before it closed.\n\nWe had to call the chemist and tell them not to close as we jetted over, and managed to get a month's worth of medicine one minute past their closing time. My poor wife's stress levels hit their peak today - she was so tired she declined my offer to make her dinner, instead having some toast and a bowl of ice-cream, and going to bed.\n\nTo the doctor at the university student \"health\", I'd like you to know that you're a colossal fuckhead, and shit like this is probably why you're you're working in a shitty little campus clinic, because you're too stupid to have your own practice or run a hospital ward like the actual professionals, and I've love the opportunity to take my $90 out of your ass, which is where you can shove your dopey fucking questions because we'll be getting our prescriptions elsewhere, you fucking hack.\n\nAin't no-one fucks with my wife.

His parents are divorced, the area he lived in wasn't very urban, and he's basically had no help or support (aside from friends) to do anything like get a job or attend college. Despite all that, I cannot fucking stand him. The first time I met him, he tried fucking gatekeeping me about a damn video game my SO got me for a Christmas (it was Skyrim the year it came out). I've had an incredibly strong dislike for him ever since that moment because he continues to be arrogant and condescending, while also vying for any and all attention he can get.\n\nMy SO brought up him staying with us because of the reasons listed above, and even though I didn't like him (I made my feelings about him clear when we were discussing this), I agreed to let him stay with us in our guest bedroom. Our master bedroom is a converted attic, so privacy wouldn't be a problem, and he could watch the puppy we got and help us out around the house. Once he got a job, he could start paying us a small amount of rent each month, maybe $150. He would also buy his own food once this happened and would have to rely on public transportation to get to whatever job he found as my SO and I both have full time jobs. We don't make a lot of money, but we were comfortable enough that we figured having one more person staying with us would be low impact enough that we could handle it.\n\nAs of writing this, it's been a little less than a month since he moved in. Our personalities do not mesh at all so I'm basically ignoring/avoiding him. We're both gamers, although I will be the first to admit that I'm not hardcore by any means. But no matter how much I talk about the MMO I play or any of the other internet/nerd shit I come across, he's still gotta fucking mansplain shit to me or continue to fucking gatekeep LITERALLY everything. You're not hot shit because you understand some fucking meme that's all over the internet and I'm not going to react to your \"\"\"obscure\"\"\" nerd reference because I'm not going to validate your fucking obnoxious behavior.\n\nMaybe if you didn't fucking play video games literally ALL FUCKING DAY and actually applied yourself to some fucking job applications instead of just having my SO do them for you, you'd actually fucking \"get your life together\" like you want to so damn badly. I know I sound like a fucking baby boomer or some shit but when I stayed home sick for a few days literally all you fucking did was play video games and talk on Discord with your friends. How about you shower more than a couple times a week (which I swear is what he does because sometimes his BO is so bad)? Do you also think you could take the initiative and help out around the house on your own? Instead of pouting like a fucking child when I ask? I swear it's like you haven't done shit for yourself before. When I ask you to fold the towels, I don't want you to fold them and then leave them on the fucking dryer! Put that shit away where it goes!! \"Are the towels folded?\" \"Yeah, they're downstairs. Did you want me to put them away?\" That was a verbatim conversation that occurred while I was doing dishes. Good fucking lord. I wanted to slam my head against a wall.\n\nI'm also pretty sure he does a shitty job of taking care of our dog. We got her in October and she's about 3 months old, so in the middle of teething and being wild and crazy and wanting to play 24/7. He'd rather just fucking sit on his computer and yell at her when she's being bad, rather than play with her when she's excited and try to fix her behavior. I'm hoping that the days I was sick were just bad, especially because I was mostly upstairs in bed and didn't see it first hand.\n\nIt's really hard to not feel like he's mooching off of us, especially because money is really tight right now. I already suffer from depression and anxiety, but now both me and my SO are stressed out and overwhelmed. I meal prep and make all of his lunches for him since that would be cheaper (and healthier) than just buying him frozen dinners. When I do laundry, I make sure he has enough towels in the bathroom he uses (luckily he knows how to do his own damn laundry). My SO helped him build a resume (which was barely anything because he graduated high school and worked under the table for a game shop sorting cards and judging MtG tournaments) and filled out job applications. We've paid for his food, his meals when we go out, his learner's permit (since he lived in a different state before), and now we're probably gonna have to cover his prescription costs and copay when we take him to a clinic because we're 99% sure he has strep throat.\n\nThere's so many other things I feel like ranting about here but I'm just going to stop because this has already gotten pretty long. I'm just tired of having someone I don't like living in my house. I love how kind my SO is because he really wants to help him, but I think him being here is taking a toll on both of us. I know I'm responsible for this situation because I could have resisted harder when my SO brought it up but I couldn't say no because I knew how much he wanted to help. Lesson learned I guess.\n\nThanks for letting me vent, reddit."

So then I tried finding a photo of the hairstyle I wanted and again I get like half my motherfucking head shaved off. \n\nI was hoping today would finally be different, because I took pictures of my own hair to show the barber and the stupid piece of shit shaved off about half of what I had in the photo. I genuinely don\u2019t know what else I can fucking do anymore! \n\nNext time I get a haircut I\u2019m just going to have to beg the barber to look closely at the picture for a fucking hour and take it as slow as possible because I\u2019m so fucking done. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll even go see a barber it\u2019d probably be better to do it myself because even if it comes out like shit, it\u2019s at least fucking free. "

You didn't have anyone to share your apartment and you couldn't manage the rent and expenses. You came to me for help, asked me to move in with you and share expenses. I was looking for a place and knew you only from a few weeks and you looked civilized. You were studying PhD and I was doing my Masters. I thought you are a fine man and I signed apartment lease. But you are the Satan itself.\n\nWe shared cooking expenses too for a few months. I used to do 3 jobs and still managed to cook on time so that our school schedule wasn't affected. I did late night job and used to come home tired. You invited your girlfriend and your cousins to stay for weeks. They lived for free. I didn't object to it. I was very accommodating. I didn't cook meat coz you are a vegetarian. But look at what you did. I snore a little when asleep because I don't get enough sleep at all. You made me move to living room because of that. When I slept, you bang the doors, you jump on floor beside me, talk loudly on phone, watch youtube videos on full volume purposefully to wake me up. You make noises in kitchen to disturb me. You spread wrong information about me to our mutual friends. You told them I was a liar when I never speak of our issues with others. You harassed me for months! I told you not to do like that. But you were taking revenge for my snoring (which didn't affect you when I moved to living room). I called 911 and they told to talk to landlady. When I complained it to landlady, she told 'Suck it up'. That's it. I hope she burns in hell too. You are the worst human on earth. With not even a little humane side.\n\nI used to hide in my cubicle in my research area at school to avoid your harassment. I used to sleep there on chair in pain for hours because you didn't let me sleep. I avoided coming home when you used to be there. I wanted to move out of this harassment apartment, but you used the lease against me and complained to landlady. She didn't let me leave. I had no option but to live under your constant harassment. \n\nYou lived well. You studied well. You are graduating this May. You have won outstanding graduate scholar and top researcher awards. You published many papers. On the other hand, I had to change my food and sleep schedule. I used to feel tired when I had to study and felt stressful. I had to resign from a job and somehow (I really don't know how I did) I finished my thesis and I am also graduating this May. I could have also won those awards but you were a monster and you didn't let me study at home. I used to sleep hungry when you occupied all the four stoves in kitchen. But it's all going to be over. I will move out on May 31st as I can break lease if I'm graduating. And that will be the most happiest day of my life. I am tired of explaining you how to behave like a human. I know you from close side. You are a monster with a PhD. Have knowledge but no wisdom.\n\nI PRAY TO GOD TO GIVE ME JUSTICE. I HOPE YOU BURN IN THE HOTTEST PART OF HELL FOREVER. AMEN.\n\n"

You wanted us to work together as a family, you wanted us to be together as family, well guess how that turned out? J is in canada, P is across the country, and you wonder why I dont wanna pick up my phone when you call? Then again, its always been about what you wanted isnt it? Never mind the fact that Dad has been working at the same company ever since he got out of college and works hard for his money, never mind the fact that he wants to retire already, you need to blow his money on more useless fucking ANTIQUES, or another fucking cabin built, or you want the pool remodeled, or this, or that or whatever the fuck your fleeting fancy wants today. You never appreciated ANY of us enough. You dragged us up to that hell hole in missouri for that one christmas break and then worked us like dogs, tearing that fucking nasty ass mold infested shitpile apart, lugging those goddamn heavy ass mattresses around and then act like you dont understand why were all frustrated and ready to kill one another. I SHOULDVE KNOWN YOU SAW US ONLY AS FREE LABOR, THATS ALL WEVE EVER BEEN TO YOU ISNT IT?! All of the house remodeling, all of the ponds and the deck and the patio, I shouldve known thats how things wouldve gone.\n\nOr maybe its your constant shittalking about all of us. Yeah I figured your game. I figured that shit out a long time ago. You shit talk to me about J, P, and Dad. It didnt take someone telling me for me to figure out you were shit talking about me to everyone else. But everytime something comes back to bite you, someone gets pushed a little too far, its all about how \"We dont appreciate you, and everything you do for us.\"\n\nLets talk about how you took away five summers away from me. Lets talk about how despite all your promises to pay me, I never saw a fucking dime. Lets talk about the way you treated E when he came for those two weeks. \n\nActually lets talk about that in more detail. I cant help that Im gay. I understand you came from a different time and place. Im thankful youre atleast accepting it. But for fucks sake, the way ou treated him was  appalling and embarrassing. First off, you cant fucking tell me that I didnt say he was coming down I told you months in advance that he wanted to come down for a couple of weeks. I know for a fact I did. I told you in december that he wanted to come down. If J and D wanted to come down for a couple of weeks in the summer, you would have the best room all set up and ready to go for them. But because E is a guy, he has to go sleep in a hotel?! And then you SET HIM TO WORK?! LIKE HE FUCKING OWES YOU ANYTHING?!  But no, seeing as hes my boyfriend, lets screw him over as well. Thats just another part of my life that you can exploit and take over. \n\n\"Another male in the house? Great, set him to work while I complain from my office.\"\n\nOh, but your precious would be daughter over there is the best thing youve got going. You treat her better than you treat the rest of us. You built her a house, you pay her salary, you give her free rent and let her friends come over any time they want. YOU BUILT HER A FUCKING HOUSE. LEMME REPEAT THAT. YOU HAD DAD BUILD HER A FUCKING HOUSE WITH AC AND WIFI.\nBut its too much for me to get paid. God forbid I ask for the summer pay you promised me time and time again that you were going to pay me. Only when it comes to pay day, you cry and yell, then storm out because I never appreciate anything you do for me. Yeah, you dragged me away from my friends for five christmas and summer breaks to work for you, all without pay because you couldnt be bothered. Never mind a summer internship to help further myself, or taking a few courses at school during the summer so I can graduate on time, You need someone up there to BITCH AND COMPLAIN AT. And then you wonder why I wont go into buisness with you. BECAUSE I LEARNED THAT LESSON FIVE TIMES IN A ROW. \n\nYou know what, Im glad Im not spending christmas with y'all. Id rather be alone than go up there to that fucking hell hole. \n\nI'm not giving you my address after I move out with E, and I wont answer any of your calls after that point either. Im taking my cat back with me and that'll be it. Keep the inheritance, I dont give a fuck."

After another ten seconds of full throated screaming he stops. I think, oh, ok, he's done. But then as soon as I think it he starts up again. This time it sounds like genuine anguish. So when he pauses for breath I venture an \"Are you doing ok there?\" to which he instantly replies in a completely normal voice, \"yeah Im fine, what about you?\"\n\nNow, I wasnt expecting that, but I manage, \"Well, alright I guess, but you just about scared the shit out of me.\"\n\n\"Ahaha, sorry about that!\" he says.\n\nIt becomes very quiet, too quiet. After about 20 seconds the screaming resumes. Now that I'm fairly certain Im not talking to someone with downs syndrome I quickly cut him off and asked if he could, \"Fucking cut that out?\"\n\n\"Ah, sorry,\" He says again in a totally normal voice, \"Im done.\"\n\nSo he's totally silent after about 2 minutes, at which point he flushes the toilet and goes to wash his hands. The sink shuts off and the bathroom gets really quiet again.\n\nThen he starts screaming again.\n\nIt lasts about 20 seconds and then he leaves.\n\nI dont even know."

The job requires me to have good enough social skills to hold a conversation if the need arises and check guests in. That's all good and fine, it's the other employees and my boss that are terrible.\n\nLike i said, i am a front desk clerk at a very nice hotel that requires somebody to be at the front desk AT ALL TIMES. and do you know how many front desk clerks there are for this particular hotel? seven. seven people to split 168 hours worth of work with. now again, that shouldn't be much of a problem, right? thats 24 hours each. the problem is, i can never have a sick day or be spontaneous and take time off. if i'm scheduled to work, there is no excuse for me to leave that will suffice. \n\ni have been working here for about 7 months, and in that seven months i have asked for two instances of time off. no more than 6 days each. i got them time off and it wasn't a big deal. (i'm 19 and still don't have to take care of very much aside from myself. haha, nananana boo boo) i have a co worker, she is already a grandmother and taking care of more people than i can remember. in the town i live in, there are special events going on this week for the native americans that live here. she is a native american and requested a weeks (paid) vacation to enjoy herself, which she admittedly deserves.  But when she put in the request, she was told she could take the time off, but not receive any pay. She has been with this hotel for a good few years and is still on minimum wage.\n\nthere's nowhere to go up in this damn place. no signs of change in the future. \n\nthe most annoying part for me, however, is the \"drama book\" we use. Now i used quotation's because it's not actually the drama book, it's called the pass along book. This is the book where front desk employees can help out one another by writing down any problems they had in it so all can learn from it. I.e. Mr. Soandso would like an extra pillow in his room from now on, or, check the bucket to make sure everything is as it should be. The book was a good idea, but everyone turned it into shit. now all of the entries are just about how poorly someone is at something, or how it's a 'no brainer' if someone messed up. basically, the book is calling each of us stupid.\n\nwhen i had time, (my shifts switched from day time: 3-11pm to 11pm-7am) i told my boss i'd prefer him to tell me one on one how i messed up, and he did and it was much easier to learn from it that way. now that i'm on a different shift, however, he has taken it upon himself to list my mess ups in the drama book and make me sound stupid in the process.\n\none day, our website was down, which means i couldn't check anything. i didn't know weather or not we were full, what we had available the next day or the next. a guest was due to check out the following day, but asked for an extension. i told her the computers were down, but it shouldn't be a problem and that i'd work on it as soon as the computers were back up. she must have interpreted this as, 'it's taken care of'. it was not. turns out i forgot about the big native american gathering going on, and there were no rooms available. she was mad and of course in the pass along book, i have to read this (word for word and punctuated as follows):\n\n'one thing that i didn't think i would have to go over is if someone wants to extend their stay don't tell them it's fine and THEN check availability, you check your availability first, NO BRAINER here' \n\nfuck this place and its stupidity"

You always tell me how guys in the past have treated you like shit, how they just used you for sex, how they cheated on you, but that I'm different than them, and you can tell I'm different. That I won't do that shit to you.\n\nYou always tell me that you want to go out, you like me a lot, we're constantly talking, how our weirdness with each other is something you love seeing, yet the only time I'm able to see you is when we're working together and you're in a bad mood for the most part? \n\nEvery single time I've asked you to do something, you've had an excuse. Yes, you've been busy some of those times, which I completely understand, I don't fault you for those times. But what about today? You did nothing after you got home. NOTHING. You slept and were lazy, but didn't want to do anything, didn't even want me to come over because you were too tired or too lazy. \n\nI say what about tomorrow, a day that I asked you about last week, and you said, and I quote \"I'm not doing anything tomorrow except sleep, I'm fucking tired as shit.\" Yet not 15 minutes later, you text me saying how you're pissed that your friend who we work with is working tomorrow, and that pisses you off because you were gonna do shit. Oh okay than.\n\nI'm not holding this over your head (which is why I'm saying this here and not to you), but remember last week? When you were closing and you asked me to stay with you because you didn't wanna be alone there until 1 in the morning? So I did, after getting off at 10. I waited there. I came up to where you were and I was talking to you, then you started having a seizure. Out of nowhere. Absolutely terrifying, but I tried to keep you calm. You went home, and because I was the only other person there, I closed for you. It wasn't much, just mopping the floor. \n\nBut when I texted you after, just to make sure you were alright because I was scared, you said, quote \"I'm afraid you don't like me anymore\" because I saw you have a seizure. I told you that changed NOTHING about how I felt about you. That'd be like you getting pissed at me because I'm a diabetic. It's something you can't control, why would I hold it against you? You said that made you really happy.\n\nI've been nothing but open with you. I told you \"what you see is what you get. I'm me.\" Stole that from John Candy, but it still described how I am perfectly. You liked that. Yet you would think that if you liked me as much as you said, don't you think you'd try to NOT be lazy, or sleep until 2 in the afternoon, so you could see me, which you claim to want to do?\n\nYou say you're not the hopeless romantic type, not like other girls, that you're \"pretty weird.\" You even said 5 hours ago that \"I wanna go out with you I'm just exhausted man.\" Yet we're still holding onto a conversation at 12:30 in the morning. Last week you were exhausted, this week you're exhausted, yet we're up talking until 4 in the morning. Are you kidding me?\n\nEven your sister told me about how much you said you liked me! Your fucking sister, who said it's a good thing that you even likes me, because you're usually weird or reserved when it comes to guys. You don't let people in, yet you apparently let me in. So why the FUCK have we not hung out? You live 10 fucking minutes away, I said I'd even come over just to nap with you because I wanted to spend time with you. I was desperate because everything else that I suggested was either met with \"I'm tired\" or wasn't even met with anything.\n\nI know I'm forgetting things, I know I am. I'm angry and spewing venom, fuck off.\n\nThe worst part of it all is that maybe I just am too friendly, too open with you. Fucking hell, it's only been two weeks, what the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I letting it get me this upset? I don't know, but it does, and I'm beginning to think that maybe I fucked up trying anything with you.\n\nBut you wanna hear the saddest part? I guarantee that I'll text you tomorrow morning, saying \"good morning,\" (which you also said is something you want a guy to do, might I add) asking how you feel since you always say you feel like shit. And we'll probably text and Snapchat all damn day again like we have for the past 2 weeks, despite you saying you were gonna sleep. Doing all of that when we could be hanging out, but you're too tired. Or you'll suddenly have plans with your friends, who have to drag you out of the house (your words). \n\nWhy? Because there's times when I think that we're having a good conversation, that maybe I was wrong to feel the way I feel about this. That maybe, my gut feeling was wrong. And despite it pissing me off, I'll still keep talking to you. Because I'm a moron. Clearly. \n\nGuaranteed, tomorrow I'll still like you, and I'll still want to date you. I'll probably even regret typing all of this out, and I'll probably delete it because of it. And I have no fucking idea why, because despite you saying to the contrary, I can't help but feel you don't. \n\nYet I'll still try. Because I don't want to give up on this and end up missing out on something that could turn out awesome. Maybe next week we'll get to hang out. I'm angry right now, and I like to think that I'm forgetting the good stuff that made me like you in the first place, but I'll still be hopeful.\n\nI can't figure out why, but I am. Jesus.\n\nUpdate 1:18 PM: SERIOUSLY. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME. YOU TOLD ME YESTERDAY YOU WERE DOING NOTHING TODAY, YET YOUR FRIEND COMES OVER AND IS LITERALLY \"DRAGGING YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE\" TO GO DO SOMETHING. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HANG OUT WITH ME, FUCKING SAY IT. You can say all you want about how you like me, how you want to go out with me, how you want to date me, all that shit. Fucking prove it. Actions speak louder than words, and right now, your actions are pretty deafening to me.\n\nNOTE: I posted this over in /r/offmychest and /r/venting on another throwaway, and over in /r/rant on this account."

The package contained many items including a brand new Dell laptop. The laptop and other items were listed on the required customs form and the value declared.\n\nOn November 6, my daughter contacted me to inform me the laptop was missing. The box with all the items had been opened and re-taped. All items except the laptop (including a $100 calculator) were received. She opened the package at the French post office who assisted her in filling out a form to record the missing item. Her host mother had attempted to pick up the package earlier but noticed the package had been opened and appeared to be too light to include the expected laptop. She then took my daughter to pick up the package after school.\n\nOn November 7 (the next day), I went to the USPS office that I sent the package from to open a claim. They took the information and told me they would be in touch. Within a few hours, Linda (the office manager) contacted me to tell me because it was an international claim I had to call 1-800-222-1811. Note this is the first time USPS staff demonstrated a lack of awareness for USPS claim process.\n\nI called the 1-800 number only to be on hold for more than 25 minutes before speaking to a staff member. I was assigned a case number (DE2616480). I was also told that an investigation would take 5 days as they needed to contact the French postal service and that I would then be contacted to fill out a form and provide documentation. It was implied that would be emailed to me after I provided that information. \n\nOn November 13, not having heard a word, I called the 1-800 number again. This time I was on hold for more than 30 minutes before someone came on the line. This person told me a CN-24 needed to be filled out. In talking with this person, it was clear she had no idea what a CN-24 was - just that the French postal service needed to complete that. She also said I would need to complete a PS-1000 and a Form 35533 for my postage.  This is the second instance when it was obvious USPS staff do not know the claims process well enough to articulate it to the customer.\n\nOn November 24, I spoke with my daughter via Skype. She had been trying to fill out a form that the Chronopost International had sent to her on November 12. She expressed her frustration in not knowing how to accurately fill out the form and that her host parents also could not understand the questions asked (the form was in French and they are native French speakers). It became clear that the form was the CN-24 which is supposed to be filled out by the postal service and not the customer. The form asked such things as which air carrier was used and the telephone number for the carrier. We told her to do the best she could and just get the form sent back.\n\nOn November 25, her host mother scanned the form, the letter sent with the form, the original form filled out on November 6, and the packaging labels into a PDF and emailed it to the Chronopost International email as well as to me.\n\nOn November 27, I called the 1-800 number yet again. I only waited 20 minutes this time. However, the person answering the call was rude and could not provide any updates. When I expressed my frustration and asked if there was someone else I could speak to who could provide assistance, she told me I could call the \"claims office\" at  1-866-974-2733 and hung up! Note this is the third time a USPS staff person has indicated a lack of knowledge of the claims process.\n\nI called the 1-866 number and only waited 5 minutes before someone came on the line. During that wait I was told that due to an abundance of claims if it had not been 60 days I should wait before contacting that office. Another fine example of just how customer friendly the USPS is!\n\nThe woman at that number was also rude and not at all helpful. It turns out that is the office that will issue my check once the claim is processed. She rudely told me if I had a complaint I could call Consumer Affairs at 1-800-275-8777. \n\nAnd so I did. Finally I talked with someone who was pleasant and attempted to be helpful. Her name is Tamica and she gave me hope that not everyone at USPS is put out by helping a customer.\n\nTamica took my information and filed a complaint in a manner she hoped would be seen by a supervisor or someone who was knowledgeable about the claims process and could assist me.\n\nOn December 5, I received a call from Terry at Consumer Affairs. While he has attempted to be helpful and understanding, he has also made it clear he has 50 cases he is working. Now I wonder why that might be seeing as how USPS staff are so knowledgeable and customer-friendly! He told me he would try to contact the original 1-800 number and see if he could get an update.\n\nAs promised, he called back within a few hours. He told me that my daughter should not have gotten the form and that the USPS is supposed to send the form to the destination postal service in their language. He told me that he had been told the investigation would be completed within 5 days (hmmm where have I heard that before). He told me to call him back if I had not heard anything by the end of the five days.\n\nYou guessed it, I heard nothing. On December 13, I talked with Terry again who said he would try to get in touch with the 1-800 office again. \n\nI had not heard from him by December 16 so I called him back. He told me he had tried to call an internal number he had used before and was scolded for using that number. He said he, too, had been put on hold for more than 20 minutes on different attempts earlier that day and indicated his supervisor told him it was my issue to take care of.\n\nAt this point, I told him in no uncertain terms that was unacceptable and that the USPS was basically holding the $400 I am owed for the laptop and that I would do everything within my power to make sure everyone and anyone knew how incompetent USPS is if I did not hear from his supervisor within 24 hours.\n\nHe called me back within the half hour to say his supervisor asked if I could send them the forms my daughter had done and she would see what she could do to escalate the case. He also told me he would finally send me the PS-1000 form I needed to fill out. While on the phone with him, I emailed the PDF of the forms from France.\n\nI received the PS-1000 form on Christmas Eve. I filled that form out and sent it (along with the original mailing receipts) back to him on December 26. \n\nTo date, I have not heard anything from Terry or his office. But today in the mail, I received a letter from USPS International Inquiry Service Center dated December 28. Here is what the letter says:\n\n\"Dear Customer:\n\nThis is in further response to the inquiry you recently filed on an international Priority Mail Express International - Merchandise , article number EI905023294US, which you sent to FRANCE.\n\nThe postal service of FRANCE has advised us that this article was delivered on or about November 5, 2013.\n\nWe are pleased to have been of assistance to you in determining the disposition of this article.\n\nSincerely\nInternational Inquiry Center\"\n\n\nWTF!!!!!!!!!\n\nThis is exactly as the letter appears - caps and punctuation in odd places. A flipping form letter. USPS has not been of assistance and telling me the package was delivered was something I already knew. Apparently, USPS still doesn't get that there is a missing item from the package - the whole reason for the claim!\n\nAnd so to my US Senators Debbie Stabenow and Carl Levin, and my US Representatives Daniel Kildee and Dave Camp, how in the world can we expect the US government to help with healthcare claims when a governmental agency like the postal service can't help me make a simple missing item claim?\n\nBut mostly to Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe, fix your claims process! And get me my $400!\n\nSincerely one very pissed off customer and taxpayer!"

If so you're very proficient for a non-native.\" Look, I'm amazed at how fast people are willing to jump on the wagon and say I'm a bad writer from reading one poorly written reddit post? I can read Shakespeare, so I don't feel it necessary to prove my writing ability to a few internet trolls. \n\nAlso, people who use \"that tone\" as if they're assuming everyone else is in on the joke that the OP is stupid or crazy. You know the tone, I'm not going to replicate it. Or in real life for that matter, the tone comes off usually as a chuckle or smirk and glance to the other participants of the conversation, so as to say \"This guy, am I right? Is he SERIOUS?\"\n\nI don't know if it's my personality attracts these type of people or what it is but they're everywhere for me, literally. It's so god damn frustrating, it's like they need to pick apart every word you say, and for what reason? To prove they're smarter?\n\nThe truth is, and I don't want to come off as bragging at all, but just to illustrate, I have read hundreds of books difficult, old books. I don't need to test my iq because my testing on ACT and SAT are fine, (why should that shit matter in the first place? It's literally a number? \"who's dick is bigger\" contest). \n\nMaybe I'm just annoyed cus I had a best friend who is now a former friend who always pulled this shit to the point where it would become unbearable. I would make a joke at parties and everyone else would laugh but he had to say something putting me down. I ended up just calling him out on his shit but he's so hard headed he doesn't realize he even does it, or if he does he won't admit it.\n\nEdit: A good example of people like this is when you hear or read comments about psychedelics from people who have never done them? A friend of mine has never tried LSD, and yet is the first person to sit there and berate people who have tried them and call them every name in the book. (Because you can totally grasp a substance you've never tried right?)\n\nSorry for the rant, maybe the TLDR for this should really be \"I hate internet trolls, maybe I should stop feeding them\"\n\nBut seriously, do any INTELLIGENT and NON-CONDESCENDING people even exist anymore? If so please speak up, because your voice isn't being heard. Chances are you're probably the type of person, like me, who isn't going to criticize someone on their religion, politics, or favorite fast food restaurant, and I respect that, because you realize that the world is a melting pot of opinions and differing ideas and that is what really makes our world go around.

Both of my parents make very frequent and thorough electronic inspections on everything I own from my phone to my PS4 game dialogue subtitles and it really grinds my gears because I have asked around and when I tell people about my situation they are typically a little awestruck that my parents act this way. The more annoying part has to be the fact that they go into my message apps which I only have two, snapchat and Instagram (if you count DMs) where they open and read convos starting from the beginning of time then proceed to message people they deem not decent enough for me to talk to and block them without telling me. They draw these conclusions with almost no real knowledge of the person and who they really are so I find myself finding these people in person and explaining the situation to them. This is actually fairly uncommon though as most of the time I don't even have my phone. My phone is the first \"privilege\" that they take (I pay for my line) and they will take it for something as simple as a C on the 10 point daily assessment for a math class. Im a 17 year old who currently has straight A's with only one C because of two bad quiz grades and I'm not exactly in easy classes, I'm forced to take all AP classes and I'm almost a year ahead of my peers academically ( I lived internationally for a awhile and yeah they smarted me up). Because of this C I don't have a PS4, a phone, and I'm not allowed to leave the house other than athletic or school based events. I haven't even been on a date with a girl in almost a year because I'm afraid that they'll send an envoy with me or even attend themselves. And its not like they have a major precedence to go off of really I don't have any kind of pornographic addiction or associate with anyone in illegal affairs and I don't go out drinking and smoking and fucking not that I'm dissing those who may have relative behaviors but my parents see these things as the kind of acts that damn you straight to hell. and I've just about had it. I can't even watch Netflix on weekdays and after I watched a single episode of a TV-MA rated TV show (altered carbon) my mother went through and watched an episode and set my account to a KIDS acct......i am 17.... Everyday i am with friends who have SO much more liberty than me and it makes me so furious and I feel cheated out of my youthfulness."

Lately I have been hesitant to stay because I feel like the dorms are dirty, but of course, against my gut feeling, I stayed two nights last weekend when I REALLY didn't want to. His dorm smells HORRIBLE because his roommate seems to have an unsolvable body odor issue. So of course, staying in the room makes me want to take a shower.. because showers are supposed to make you feel CLEANER. \n\nSo I took a shower in the disgusting bathrooms.. and a little less than a week later, I discover a small ring on my neck!! I went to the doctor on Friday and they confirmed that it is in fact ringworm in its early stages. They told me to use a cream twice a day everyday until it's gone. I was skeptical because even though it seemed like that was the only ring, I wasn't convinced that I could keep it from spreading with just a cream.. and of course IT DID SPREAD. It is literally ALL OVER MY BODY. The spots are still fairly small, but they are only getting worse!! \n\nI have been doing everything I possibly can to keep it in check. I have been changing my sheets, applying the cream, using new towels for everything, discarding dirty clothes in a specific bin, etc. \n\nI am also a retail sales associate in a higher end women's clothing store. It's a very demanding job because we always have a lot of things going on. I work very hard but I have one particularly difficult boss. So I have had to deal with this rash driving me nuts all day AND being snipped at for very minor things all day! Fortunately it had not spread to my face so I could keep going to work... well.. nope. I just discovered a small spot on my face this evening. This now means that I cannot go to work, because who wants to buy anything from someone with a ringworm rash on their face? This means that I won't get payed.. and this is bad.. because I haven't had very many hours lately. This is also bad because my boyfriend doesn't have a job and refuses to get a job because he doesn't want it to interfere with school. I bought him a ticket to a thing that we really wanted to go to with my own money expecting that I would have some sort of income!!!\n\nI am also furious because my entire EXPENSIVE wardrobe is basically done for because you're supposed to wash everything in HOT water but I can't because a lot of my clothing is hand wash with COLD WATER ONLY or DRY CLEAN. They don't even tell you what to do about that!!!!\n\nMy skin is incredibly dry and cracked from constantly having to wash my hands after accidentally touching the affected area... and I really can't apply lotion to the rest of my body either because the rash is small but EVERYWHERE. \n\nI am just so MAD and I feel VIOLATED! It obviously is not my boyfriend's fault but I can't help but feel a little frustrated with him for this no mater how wrong that is. Even though a lot of people leave his school on the weekends and go home, he likes to stay. This can be annoying because I am always the one to trek out there because he wants me to. That particular weekend I REALLY didn't want to go because I was due for my period.. and I have endometriosis so every period is more of a hell than the last.. and of course.. I got my period while I was there, couldn't even walk, felt horrible, and was ill for the past week because of it. \n\nI just don't even know what to do at this point. \n\nOn top of all of this, one of my ears is really blocked and I have horrible chronic tinnitus so it makes the whole thing about 100x worse. I have a bit of the rash right next to the opening of my ear and I don't want to risk spreading it into my ear by any means.\n\nJust.. what. "

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.**\n\nI've been friends with this girl, we shall call her Melissa, for 4-5 years since middle school, with us getting closer into \"best friend status\" 2 years ago when we entered high school.  Alrighty. Now we've been chill, we've never fought or had petty drama for those 2 years we've been \"best friends\" because I'm pretty fucking chill. But fuck that, I'm also a petty bitch. \n\nHonestly, it started when my friend asked me if I wanted to go to homecoming with her because this guy asked her. (we shall call him howard, and he is in few of our classes) Alright whatever, I (like an idiot) assume we're all hanging out in a big group because we're all friends here. NOPE. I get straight up abandoned in the fucking cold. Bitch I went with you to the dance as a scapegoat? For 21 dollars?! (1 dollar was bullshit coatcheck). So okay fine, I was fucking naive that you'd hang out with me. I leave after a while, because fuck that shit and she comes up to right before I was about to leave hugging me and crying about sorry, and some bullshit. Whatever, I console her (FOR THE 50th TIME THIS WEEK) and she seems satisfied that she hadn't pissed me off and go off with Howard AGAIN and doesn't look back at me. So yeah, I leave. (OH WHATELSE IS BULL SHIT, OUR OTHER FRIEND HAD A BIG FUCKING CRUSH ON HOWARD, BUT GUESS WHAT? HOWARD LIKED MELISSA. SO OKAY GREAT IF YOU LIKE HIM GO TO HOMECOMING WITH HIM STOP CRYING ABOUT IT, CHLOE'S GONNA GET HEARTBROKEN LATER AND YOU DIDNT SEEM TO GIVE A FUCK SO WHAT THE FUCK?) \n\nAND Shit. 3 days later, I find out from my loud ass friends in Math class to CHECK INSTAGRAM. The fuck you want me to check instagram for- ohhhhh. Well thank you so very much upon telling me you were going out by putting Howard<3 and Melissa<3 on your fucking bio. Hey, your best friend spent a good chunk of time on your blubbery weepy mess for the pass 2 weeks, and then 4 hours at a fucking freezing lame ass dance and I don't get a \"Hey, guess what I'm dating Howard, or even a text?\" common decency? No, of course, I should have noticed that you were together, or of course I should have checked your fuking bio, because I'm on your instagram page all the fucking time am I RIGHT?! NO BITCH IT DOESNT WORK THAT WAY. JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. AND SO LIKE THE GREAT FRIEND I AM, I BRUSH OFF THE DANCE, AND THIS AND GO ON MY MERRY WAY.\n\n6 Months later. Melissa and Howard are having problems. So guess what Melissa does? She doesn't talk to Howard, and she comes back to us (Chloe and me) and starts chatting away like nothing ever happened, or like she doesn't have a boyfriend. WTF? I thought you fucking didn't think we existed after being with your boyfriend for 6 months. And Howard is now upset that she's ignoring him and tells me \"uh- I think that- you're really toxic to melissa and I don't want that\". LIKE UH NO, GTFO. Like bitch, who the fuck do you think you are? And one random day, I see that those two have made up. Alrighty then.\n\nSEVERAL THINGS WHY I NOW IGNORE THE SHIT OUTTA YOU. \nHey BITCH, HOW FUCKING DARE YOU TELL ME TO GET A BOYFRIEND WHEN I ASKED YOU TO MAYBE SET SOME TIME ASIDE SO WE CAN HANG OUT. REMEMBER IM YOUR \"BEST\" FRIEND? HEY, I HAVE HIGHER STANDARDS THAN THAT DUMBASS YOU HAVE FOR A BOYFRIEND, MAYBE *GASP* SOME OF US DONT WANT A BOYFRIEND. WWWWOOOOOOWWOWOWOOOWOWOW WOULD YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? \n\nAND OOOHHH HOW MANY HAVE YOU CALLED ME IRRESPONSIBLE? HEY I WAS KEEPING UP WITH CURRENT EVENTS (BET YOU DONT KNOW 10 EVENTS HAPPENING IN EUROPE RIGHT NOW), OR READING WHEN YOU WERE STAYING UP SAME TIME AS ME TEXTING YOUR DUMB AS A BAG OF BRICKS BOYFRIEND. \n\nOH AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE? FUCK YOU BITCH. I'M HONESTLY TIRED OF YOUR SHIT. Hey guess what Chloe, Melissa, and I joined Acadeca, and I see her when we have practice. But GUESS WHAT? I don't see why you try, you didn't join any clubs during school and you're grades might be honors, but your scores are fucking horrible. A team? As if. Try convincing colleges to accept you on just your mediocre ass grades and no extracurriculars. And the way I see it, you have no fucking originality. Go leech off your shitty bag of shit boyfriend. Fuck you and your 4'11 ass. I tried. So goodbye.\n\n\n**tl;dr:** Melissa go fuck yourself, I'm done hearing about your stupid problems- oh wait you don't bother to text me anymore. Fuck this and this one sided friendshit."

I love my country, but the majority of people in it, NOT so much.\n\nI wanna start off by saying, they are selfish. Stubborn, and insecure.\nIn my town, the community is ridiculous. Most of them are either on their iPhone, on Facebook, or doing some ridiculous thing that isn't reality. And they look down on people as well. They even have a name for normal people...get this, \"bogans\". Bogans were I'm sure once normal people, who lived a normal life, and actually lived reality. \n\nBut then all the stubborn rich fucks looked down on them like they were pieces of dog shit, and this oppression made them angry. And then the community gets angry at the bogans, even though they technically caused them to BE bogans.\n\nWith that being said, there could be mild schizophrenia going around in the country's communities. They cause a huge problem, and then they play it off as they didn't cause it and it was the problem's fault. \n\nAnd before you say I am talking about all of Australia, there are tons and tons of normal people in this country, they are just oppressed by the rich snobs. \n\nOne thing that pissed me off recently was a school near where I live got a bomb threat from this Russian hacking group and it was Reptile Day apparently. So what do they do? They leave the poor animals there, shove them in fridges to keep them inactive, and leave them to die. They could have just took the fucking animals with them and brought them back to wherever animal place they take care of them in. It is a two-second job to pick up the animals and take them out of the building. But no, Australia has this thing called Anthropocentrism. If you don't know what it means, it is the belief that humans are the superior race and that animals are a piece of shit basically. Australia has a severe case of it. Animals have feelings too, people realize that? They are living beings on this planet who should be treated the same. It makes me sick that people can just leave those poor animals behind, all for THEMSELVES. \n\nAustralia's high schools are really ridiculous as well. I go to high school and almost everyone treats you like shit. They are all so ugly too, why would they be popular in the first place?\n\nAlmost everything here needs to be as posh and expensive as possible. You go into a cafe and you got these complex dishes with all this foreign herbs and stuff that an innocent person would not have even thought existed. Can't it be just as simple as a coffee? That's what a cafe was for.....simple stuff like that.\n\nMy town is really obscure, so all these posh community people have to make an account for our town on every social media website. They don't get that much views compared to the non-community videos I've seen, like skate videos and stuff. They get more views than the official community videos. Can't these idiots just realize that unless someone actually makes effort in revolutionizing the town, that it will forever remain obscure?\n\nAustralia's ridiculousness hasn't been a recent thing. In the 1960s, when English rock band The Who came to Australia to play, Australia didn't like them because they were too dangerous and I think they were called bastards at one point. No wonder drummer Keith Moon started throwing fire slurs at them when this Aussie presenter tried interviewing him later on.\n\nAnother thing that pisses me off is racism. Australia is really racist, and the usual targets are Chinese, Indian and even Aboriginals, the people that made Australia what it was and deserve bigger credit than they already do. Well guess what? These \"ching-chongs\" and \"curry munchers\" (the slurs Australian people usually use on those poor people) are well advanced in technology, in fact China is literally the biggest technology country in the fucking world, and Japan is pretty close too.  \n\nBut luckily, this isn't the ENTIRE country. There are wildlife people in this country. There are normal people who don't care what you think in this country. There are people who are acceptable of race in this country. That's good enough for me.\n\nIn conclusion, not all of Australia is what I said, but the majority?\nAbsolutely.\n\nCmon Aussie Cmon, straighten the fuck up."

So they take that and \u201cmake it their own\u201d by that they mean make completely ruin the good thing. So they write fan fiction and fan art, now like 99.9% of the time these two take; let\u2019s say 2 of the main characters that are complete opposites and women an hate each other cause that\u2019s how the story is supposed to be. They take these two characters and make them sex-depraved lesbians who really want to nothing but fuck, oh yeah and they have somehow; grown penises. Then when that form is in fan art it all looks exactly the same. It\u2019s like it was a pencil sketch, but it\u2019s not pencil. It\u2019s like they took a pale pink fucking rose-art crayon in their 3rd Period \u201cart\u201d class while they talk to their friends about how they totally ship the newborn baby that showed up once in episode 82 and Carlll \u201cwith 3 l\u2019s cause it\u2019s really funny and it\u2019s what tumblr people do and you wouldn\u2019t understand\u201d among other things like \u201cyou hate ppl\u201d and how a bi-sexual bathroom is a great idea and how \u201cbi-sexual\u2019s are treated like freaks.\u201d oh yeah and Sleeping with sirens is amazing. then drew it with that. It literally comes out like some kid with severe ADHD couldn\u2019t draw a curved line so they made bunch of fucked up lines to resemble something that required skill. This whole section is perverted. You know it. They know it. \n\nNow it\u2019s time for the way people on tumblr speak to each other. It basically involves one of about 10 phrases with or without an incoherent sentence to fool the reader into not sensing any type of intelligence, because that\u2019s a major no-no on tumblr. These phrases include \n\u201cI\u2019m done\u201d or \u201comg so done\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d, \u201cI swear tumblr /or everyone here is on drugs\u201d, when something cool is shown \u201cThis is the future\u201d \u201cwhat if [insert some retarded scenario](insert some question easily solvable by science or common sense)\u201d Usually followed by \u201cwat\u201d , After pun \u201cget out\u201d The reason they say \u201cget out\u201d after a pun is because the tumblr people realize that was too clever to be thought up by someone who should be using tumblr and doesn\u2019t want to be smart in any way, \u201cDoctor who related thing\u201d , \u201cI\u2019m crying\u201d then there\u2019s \u201cDid you just\u201d after someone says a pun relating to some fandom. \n\nThe way tumblr talks is a horrible thing because it affects EVERYONE. People think it\u2019s funny if their IQ is fewer than five and since this whole world is a majority of stupid people this shit shows up everywhere, mainly Facebook pages (which are thankfully dying a slow, painful death thanks to Kim Jong Un (love you bb)) \n\n   Now, Feminists; I got to give them credit cause they try to act intelligent but even the tumblr people realize they\u2019re retarded so they are shunned. Though where would we really be without feminists?? Probably making your momma jokes. \n\nSummary: Tumblr is a joke within itself and helps out mentally stable teenagers who like to tell strangers as stupid as them they\u2019re going to kill themselves and whose parents did the nasty to /or in front of them while they were young and Facebook pages ran by neck beards who were kicked out of 4chan for being too annoying. So Tumblr should just be quarantined from the whole world in my honest opinion.\n\nI just have a message for those of you who have a good idea, please keep it off of tumblr; they won\u2019t appreciate it. They\u2019ll just want to put their genitals in it.  \n\nAlso: I seriously think everyone on tumblr is a pedophile \n  \nEDIT: Grammar \n\n"

But when there are only 3 to choose from, none of which being ones I wanted, I get a little upset. Two years of Korean? Oh yes. Three of Russian? Of course. Four of Japanese? I'd be spoiled!\n\n\n But nooo, let's learn *spanish* or *french*. I don't hate these languages, I just prefer learning literally any other. They're just not for me. Of all the languages I could want to learn, the ones that I don't want are the ones that are required. I get that there may not be teachers that could teach it or enough students interested, but I hate that learning one or two from a very small list is mandatory for any graduation.\n\n\n I don't struggle in these classes. I do just fine. I'm just completely uninterested and will probably forget most of it by the time I'm in college.\n\n\n This is completely unnecessary, but here's a comparison of what is taught vs what I want to or am studying.\n(Spanish, French, German)\n(Korean, Chinese, Russian, Japanese, Swedish, Greek, Polish, Irish)\n\n\n Studying for French takes a good chunk of time for me to get an A in that class. It's making me *not* want to learn any language. This feeling will go away during the summer when I don't have a language that I don't want to learn but is required to study. At least the college I'm thinking of attending will have some of them.\n\n\n tl;dr:Foreign language classes are required to graduate, but the language options feel very limited, and none of the options are what I want to learn."

Whatever, no sex is being had IDGARA. Except they're LOUD. All. The. Fucking. Time. Until early hours of the morning and she knows I have to work early. \nSome bills get missed, late payments. I hound her for the money, she says she has none. Goes around buying hundreds of dollars in useless shit, including a 120$ sword she didn't fucking need. Pays for three seperate gyms/martial arts, never has money to pay me for the food she eats. I end up having to stop buying groceries. I exist on delivery and fast food which is bad for my health and my wallet. Fuck that fucking cunt, but I made a commitment and we have four months left in the lease.\n\nThen begins the drama, not that it ever really ended because her life is SO HARD! So fucking hard that she works three jobs. One of which is free labor. As in, she goes in but isn't being paid. For eight motherfucking months.

Fuck that noise, but at least we're together.\n\nSo I tell my best friend of eight years I'm moving out with my boyfriend. She screams at me for it. Tells me I'm a fuck up and I'm not worth shit, that all I do is run to my mommy for money (That I EARNED and put aside for myself! MY OWN FUCKING MONEY TYVM). What the fuck does she have?

You sad little piece of shit cunt. \n\nTells me she's \"the only one\" supporting me and my boyfriend. Tells me my other best friend (Call her M) said the only reason me and my boyfriend should live together is so that we'll break up (never happened. Talked to M, she never fucking said any of that shit). Tells me she thinks we'll fail, that she's gonna take care of me because she's the only one who can or will. Takes my boyfriend aside, tells him I said my mother and uncle told me they thought we'd break up. Tries to break us up through manipulation. Made my boyfriend cry and question our entire relationship.\n\nDenies. EVERYTHING. Makes it all about me being a big heartless bitch. Accuses me of not giving a shit. \n\nMotherfucker I have been literally and metaphorically supporting your bitch ass since we met. You are not going to toy with me like I'm some fucking teenager or a beaten dog. Least of all will I let you fuck with my boyfriend's head like that.\n\nI don't need you or your shit in my life. A year is way too long as it is. I don't even wish I was dead, I wish she was. I'm going to hell or whatever the fuck for saying that, but this is what betrayal after eight years of me giving her everything I had and more feels like.\n\nTl;Dr: Best friend of eight years tries to break up six year relationship between me and my boyfriend. Steals all my food, can't pay bills on time and is generally a huge cunt. Wish I could afford to leave this shithole."

I look forward to death and would love to see armageddon. Never compromise.

Some can be cool, but overall it is a shitty rotten species that does far more damage than good. If a world war were to happen, the only good thing is that humanity might be killed and animals would be left to not be tortured and nature could flourish without being raped and trashed.\n\nFuck humans.

I didn't know if she'd been hurt or worse. I told her that she should have texted me at the very least, that I had been worried. Otherwise, I am not her mother. If she wants to hook up, and it doesn't ruin the reputation of my organization, whatever. I don't value getting drunk myself, but I don't care if people drink, as long as it doesn't do anything to make our lives harder. \n\nThis morning, she was out until 3am, when she came back and turned on a few lights. She is \"afraid of the dark,\" so I just put my mask on and tried to go back to sleep. \n\nThen I realized she was talking to a man. I have VERY bad trust issues with men due to something that happened when I was 18, and began to shake out of fear and anger. I waited for him to leave. She got in bed, and I hadn't heard the door open or close. So of course, I knew he was in bed with her. They were both pretty drunk. \n\nI jumped out of bed and grabbed my valuables. I texted her telling her to get him out. She didn't. So I talked to the front desk, and they said we would be calling the police if she didn't remove him from the room. After an hour, she did. \n\nDo I call my boss? I feel like this is harassment, as I was placed in an extremely hostile situation. I am absolutely done with her. I am already getting ready to leave for the airport 6 hours earlier than I planned. \n\nWhat do I do??????? We are beyond the calm conversation. When I said i had been concerned for her the night before, she went \"oooooh, I see.\" In a perfect mean girls voice, and didn't speak to me the rest of the day.

While I on the other hand was her age all I had to do was raise my voice in the slightest and My Mom would rush at me with a belt. Now I belive in beating your children. Let me rephraise that. I belive in taking off your belt and whooping your chidren if they've done something wrong. Like they used to do in the old days. I do not mean beating your kids half to death. I used to get hit alot and now that I look back on it I was very bad and understand why my parents hit me alot for my wrongings. But my sister can call me a dumbass in front of my parents and they'll just go about their buisness. Like it never even fucking happened. True story one time we were all eating at the dineing room table and me and my sister got into an argument. I forget what it what about but I know I was getting pissed. Halfway through the argument my sister yells \"NO YOU ARE WRONG I CAN EVEN LOOK IT UP DUMBASS\" I look over at my parents waiting for them to retaliate and start beating her on the spot. But no neither of them said a word. Or even looked back at me they just sat there and ate like everything was fine. I ended up just taking my plate to my room and eating there because I was fucking done with her shit. Call me evil or fucked up but i Genually hate her and hope she tests positive for HIV one day. I hope she dies before me so I can finally live without her. And another thing she gets anything she wants no matter the price and the exact time she wants it to.I remember a while ago when we went to visit my uncle in pensyilvania (we live in NJ) we all went to walmart and my sister saw something she liked and my parents right then got it for her. This wouldn't be a problem if it didnt cost $100. but then on our way out she saw an outfit she wanted and just \"needed it\" that also ended up coming out to $45. WE SPENT MORE ON HER THAN WHAT WE DID TO GET WHAT WE WENT THERE FOR. Its so god damn frustrating how she can get whatever she wants when she wants it But I can ask for something which most of the time i dont even get what i want. But if I do I'll have to wait atleast 3 months if not that 8. The rest of my family is really cool but my little sister has brought so much shit the my family and I hope she fucking dies"

Pedestrians don't use the Zebra Crossing, so drivers don't stop before the line. Drivers don't stop before the line, so pedestrians don't use Zebra Crossings. Endless cycle of idiocy. \n\nPeople don't understand lanes. If there's a signal with 3 lanes (1 to go right, another to go straight, and another to turn left), People will wait in whichever lane has less cars, and just go wherever they want to anyway, cutting people off. Fuck them.\n\nAt night, you see 2 special types of morons. Type 'A' don't even switch on their lights at all, so on badly lit roads, you probably won't even see them.

Stand outdoors in a large crowd for about 2hrs around your appointment time. Then be herded into a hot room with no ventilation except one open door leading into the room, and another to a very smelly dark bathroom. Sit in that room for another hour, only to be called up, given a number, and asked to wait. Watch the guy sitting idly by playing Candy Crush on his phone. Once he's figured he's played enough, he will call people one by one to give them forms to fill out, and sign. Fill your form. Sign. Go into another room. Give the number to a guy at the door. Take your photo. Sign again. Get told to sit down for another 30mins. Then get told you're supposed to be somewhere else. Rush into the room where you take a written test which is so simple, a toddler could pass it by arbitrarily guessing (2 out of 3 answers you can give are correct). Then go outside. Take another number, and go outside where it's scorchingly hot. Stand in a 'line' which is just a random gathering where the guy behind you will invade your personal bubble and try to see how close he can get, because according to Indians, that'll make the line move faster. FINALLY you get called to a car. The guy sits in the passenger seat, tells you to drive. Your time to shine. You turn on the car, clutch, put it into gear, start moving, \"OK VERY GOOD GO\". You're done. He stamps your paper, you go sit in another room with another number, and you sign a piece of paper, and go home and wait for your license. \n\nFucking idiocy. "

But the point is that if you ask me what I would like to do in my spare time, the answer would really be some variation of the following:\n\nChill on a beach\nWork out\nTravel to another beach\nWork out some more\nLearn to surf\nEat\nThat tells me something is wrong.\n\nIt tells me that I haven't figured out what the hell I'm doing on this planet yet. It tells me that I am making a big mistake with my life.\n\nYou know, last week I was watching Shark Tank and it had a strange effect on me. All these people were getting deals for multiple thousands of dollars for their ideas that weren't that incredible.\n\nBut the point was that they were out there trying.\n\nThey came up with their idea, created their product and hit the pavement to try to sell it to stores. There's really no substitute for getting out there and trying to sell your shit.\n\nThen they got a lucky break and got to appear on Shark Tank.\n\nAfter watching the show, it gave me a strange feeling. I was struck with this kind of impatience, this feeling of, \"What the fuck is taking so long? Why am I not doing this?\"\n\nI took a look at my current situation and got very dissatisfied. Sure, I technically am a business owner. Well, at least I am getting 50% of the profits of one.\n\nBut I don't have control over the direction of the business. If my partner decides he wants things to go one way, I'm just along for the ride.\n\nAnd sure, that's what I signed up for. He's the one with more knowledge and experience.\n\nBut at the end of the day, I need to make money and grow. How much can I grow when someone else holds the keys to my future?\n\nPart of it is that I'm just too scared to strike out on my own, even if I knew I could be successful. Well, I guess we never KNOW we will succeed - we can only believe and try as hard as we can to make sure it happens.\n\nTry, Try Again\n\nIn all my years in the workforce, I've been a partner to many businesses. After working in Texas, my old boss opened up two Dead Sea Cosmetics stands with me in the mall. We ran it for 3 months before I go too stressed out and backed out.\n\nThen I went to Australia, where I tried my hand at a hair straightener kiosk. That did slightly better - at least I made more money.\n\nBut once again, I didn't have creative control and I felt like my partner was taking unfair advantage of me.\n\nAnd now today, I get 50% of the profits of an advertising business consisting of me and a good friend.\n\nSure, its a sweet deal. He does most of the work and I just have to sell and try and close deals, with a little technical work along the way.\n\nBut its not MINE in the truest sense of the word.\n\nIts not my baby, its his. I just kind of work here. I may be the first one on board, so I have a nice deal, but I can't make any of the major decisions without running it by him first.\n\nSure we have discussions and try to brainstorm ideas and all that, but that's not the same as being the one who has his finger on the trigger.\n\nAnyway, somehow this turned into a rant about not having control over your business. It was supposed to be about what I would do with 100 million dollars in the bank.\n\nDat Rant\n\nBut that's the thing - I have a feeling that if my friend had that kind of money, for example, he would still be working his ass of like he does now. I don't think he would stop to smell the roses because he actually enjoys what he does.\n\nHe's got 2 side businesses and a full time job, which just happens to be at his dad's company (where he is next in line for the throne). He's hustling hard and has ever since I've known him.\n\nBut that's him. Those are his things, not mine. Even if he cuts me in for 50% of all of them, they'll still never be mine just because on paper, they're not.\n\nTo be truly engaged in what you're doing, you need to have a baby.\n\nNot a screaming infant, but a baby in a more metaphorical sense of the word. You need to have something that you are invested in, that you want to see grow and change and fill your pockets with $100 bills.\n\nDo I have something like that? No.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, I have the money to start something like that. And I have plenty of ideas.\n\nBut what trips me up is thinking to myself, \"Okay, do I REALLY want to spend all my time doing X?\"\n\nUsually X is something boring and stupid.\n\nI suppose there's some added novelty if its YOUR business. And if you have your money on the line then you will work harder to keep it afloat because you don't want to go back to working at McDonald's.\n\nStill... I need to pick something that I love. Something that I look forward to getting out of bed in the morning to do.\n\nNot just something that will pay the bills.\nNot just another job because I'm too lazy to think of anything.\nNot another job or venture that I hate but pays well.\nNot something where I say to myself, \"I'll just do it temporarily and then use the money for something else.\"\nNot another venture where I am just along for the ride.\nNot a business where I have no control.\nYou see, this is why I liked selling drugs. I'll never forget that feeling of elation of knowing that every time your phone rings, money will flow into your pocket soon after. There's nothing like answering your phone and having someone tell you they want to give you a hundred bucks for meeting them on the corner.\n\nTHAT'S what business should be like!\n\nNow, I can't exactly say that I was excited to get up in the morning to do that. I wasn't running a cartel by any means, it was more like a side job. And obviously it can't be done indefinitely.\n\nBut that was my taste of what being a successful businessman was like.\n\nAnyway... what would I do with 100 million dollars? I really can't say. "

She says hi back. We kinda start a conversation and keep it going. She tells me about her life and stuff, I keep listening. She tells me that she isn't actually homeless (I didn't ask that but she probably thought that I made that assumption on first seeing her). She says \"I'd rather go looking for recycling than go and beg out on the street\". I admire her for that, she's working and she's doing something. Something GOOD, might I add. \n\nSure, she's rough looking. She might be walking in alleyways and whatnot. But she's doing SOMETHING. And the whole time we were talking, she never asked me for money or anything like that. Just for some fruit and headache medicine, which I gladly gave her. She was an extremely sweet, grateful woman who I'm glad I took the time to talk to. \n\nBut she isn't who this post is about. This post is about how my mother. Now I love my mother very much, but she tends to be very cold and distant with people. She is very suspicious of strangers (which is a double-edged sword). On the one hand, she's very cautious and likes to stay safe, which is good. But on the other hand, she cannot tell the difference between good people and bad people because she thinks everyone is bad. \n\nShe made this rude snap judgement based on this woman's appearance. She said \"yeah, I saw her. She looked a little nuts, I'd prefer it if you limited your contact with people like that\". Ok, well to be fair, my mom didn't really talk with this person or get to know her, so yeah I guess she couldn't have known. But it still just makes me mad. It makes me mad how paranoid she is. It's stupid and she thinks the whole world is out to get her and/or me. I wish she would calm down and maybe think before she says things. "

I don't care enough to explain how my day is, how my job is doing and none of that shit. Do you wanna know why? Because those bore me to death.\n\nI want to hear how a TV show has an impact on you. I want to hear what a movie or a book or a song has gotten you to think and marvel about it. Shit like that - I want a hear. That's a conversation to me.\n\nI don't fucking care about having to answer, for the hundredth time, how I'm feeling or what exactly is up.

You're so fucking god damn boring!\n\nAnd it rubs off on me now.

I end up asking people how they are several times in the day and that is fucking annoying! I shouldn't have to ask them that much, one answer is enough.

So he decided to quit his job (really not stressful of a job) because of it. So now it's just me and my mother working. So of course we become even poorer than we already were. They start coming to me asking me to use my credit card for bills. Next thing I know it's been months and I have 4k in debit thanks to them.\n\nThey finally get disability and they gave my dad about 15k in back pay. I took 2k with the understanding that the rest of the money was going to be for the family to get back on our feet. Figured I could work off the 2k fast with them helping out still. I ended up needing to get mt car fixed (dad sold our only other working car for $500) so it needed to be fixed. There goes that 2k. But that's okay, they will help right? \n\nNOPE. Que my dad buying a motorcycle, a moonshine still and a fucking car pool for his new bike. All the money was gone in a matter of weeks. Now I'm stuck with 4k in debt and whenever I mention it, nothing.\n\nTopics change, they give me fake sympathy, they act like they care. It's like they just used me and won't even admit it. My mother every day tells me she has my back and that I'm the love of her life. Yet I'm crying every night and when I ask for help, nothing. My father does nothing all day except smoke weed or hang out with his biker buddies (he's 62 btw). The last time I asked him for help, he offered me 20 bucks and said \"good luck with that.\" because a rock cracked my windshield. Yet I'm the asshole cause I don't talk to him and I refuse to say anything to his shithole \"biker\" buddies.\n\nSo they wonder why I'm constantly depressed and don't talk to my father. Why would I want to when the man I grew up idolizing just gets high and can't even be bothered to pick up his wife from work when she asks. Again cause he sold her car for $500.\n\nSo this holiday season, I will get probably $100 for xmas. With a \"I don't know what to get you\" thrown onto it. Then I'll just sit in my room all night watching movies with happy families while I pretend to be apart of it."

Well that was fine and dandy cause at the moment I didnt know why.. \nA few hours past and our manager (we are going to call him Dave. ) comes in so I can finish my daily paperwork and get out of there for the day (I'm just becoming a manager so he has to be there to do certain things).  He told me he fired \"joe\" then proceeded to ask if we was still cool. I told him yea cause well I am not gonna quit cause he got fired. He then proceeded to tell me exactly why, which was the more upsetting part. One day he was at work and called Dave complaining he couldnt get money into the safe and that he needed to fix it. After Dave told Joe how to fix it. Joe claimed to have tried for a while and so Dave came up there, on his day off, for literally, what he said was a 10 second fix. Dave left and then joe decided to be a fucking moron and use the SPEECH TO TEXT program on his phone, while standing in a area where there is a camera and microphone, and proceeded to talk shit about  Dave and Erin (Erin is the assistant manager there). Dave heard this while reviewing the camera footage to see if Joe had actually made any attempt to fix the problem..\n\nI come home and told Joe \"i guess I should have warned you ab out the mics in the area\"  he told me he didnt care.. then a few moments later told me he knew about the microphones and intentionally said and did that shit on camera so where Dave would hear it. To me I personally feel insulted as to me that tells me as a person you don't care about having a job, or care about earning money for rent. whats worse is this incident happened a few weeks ago and then Dave cut Joes hours and then joe was like \"oh man fuck they cut my hours blah blah blah, I should find another job\" and I haven't seen them try, but then again i do work sometimes in the mornings and I don't know exactly what all he does on his computer.\n\nbut this whole angry rant also boils down to. I don't trust the dude hardly to GET another job without me being a utter dick. well WHY? when the dude moved out here, dude claimed he was a wielder and instead of you know, putting effort into getting a wielding job when he moved out here, or setting up with elwood staffing which he has gone through and I told him way before he moved out here they was out here.. he decides to get the first job, more or less handed to him. now Im utterly and completely fustrated cause now I got to pay rent and bills all on my own and I just don't really see how IM going to  do it. I felt like I took one left forward moving in then 4 steps back since Ill have to spend every penny I got now into keeping the lights and gas on and staying in here..."

The person who opens every morning should only have to brew coffee, check some counts (cigarettes and Lotto scratchers), and see if the papers have arrived. \n\nJust opened when he closed the previous night, covering for the lady who usually closes on Saturdays. He's been here about 2 weeks now, and seemed competent enough from what others said. I came today, and opened a tad early because someone was at the door and I was running a bit late. No big deal. Just type in the total on my papers and we're peachy, right? \n\nLo and fucking behold, everything is FUBAR. Not only did he write the wrong amount of cigarettes (which becomes my problem and can cost me $5 a pack from my already shitty paycheck), but the goddamn total in the register is wrong too. Usually I never have to worry about this; instead of having $370.21 like he wrote, there's actually $125.78. Sounds like a small issue, but again, the difference comes out of my paycheck if the boss doesn't believe me - he tends to be understanding, thankfully. Still doesn't feel nice to close and see: CASHIER SHORT AMOUNT: $2xx.xx \n\nThe trash was emptied, as required, but he seriously left them without bags and either on their side, or hanging out the drawer they're tucked into. It was so lazy, like, can you not put a new bag in? \n\nBags got put in, wasting time I could be counting with. Guess what? The coffee pots are only sort of cleaned! So now, I have to check all my pots and clean any before brewing coffee. Our brewer is slow enough as is, taking ~10 minutes per pot, with 5 to make. Now I have the pleasure of walking to the back and cleaning coffee from yesterday on top of everything. Mind you, I have customers coming in and I have to drop what I'm doing for them. \n\nWorking on the coffee, still. His cigarette counts were right, but he couldn't be bothered to leave his total - which also becomes my problem upon opening. Not a big deal, just another pebble in my shoe. Got it handled relatively quick. \n\nHe got stressed over a key not working on one our doors, I guess, and panic attacked through closing everything. Can't hold that against him, as the key really doesn't work with a lock that it should. I'm just frustrated he rushed through everything and left a mess for me to clean up. I'm already stressed out about life as it were, and I really don't need to be doing someone else's job on top of it. \n\nIt's a stupid, petty rant, but it's my rant. Probably just grumpy because I'm still tired. "

March 31, didn't call DROVE UP THERE TO SEE WHAT THE HELL WAS GOING ON!  Oh, we found the problem you need an alternator and some gaskets as leaking oil was causing the short.

We have to have certain items on our newfangled google drive thingamajig to graduate (started with last year's seniors). So, not having something to take a picture of one of the assignments with, I ask the girl next to me (this is history class, and for the record we had no romantic connections and I deeply hate her for this, but I'm still polite around her) to do it for me since the teacher won't let us sneak it out of the classroom (which I did for all other classes, yes i know i'm a sneaky scumbag at times), so she took a picture of it and she \"emailed\" me it. Except I never got it. So, cue me giving it a week before I begin my nagging, and my digital tools (mostly ~~MS Office~~ Google Docs and Powerpoint. Actually, that's all the class was) final exam (a personal business letter to the teacher about three assignments and printing the tracking sheet we needed (to send to the GBP lady). So, after the week passes, I consistently nag the girl, both in person and through email basically saying \"Hey, are you going to send me this document I asked you to send me x amount of weeks ago? I need it for Mr. BusinessTeacher's final.\"\n\nNo response. She kept insisting she did it, but I knew she was lying. Cue me nagging her over the course of the summer, ultimately asking for it by 9/9. Did I get it? Of course not, but by August, after **SENDING FIVE FUCKING BILLION EMAILS TO HER NAGGING HER TO DO THE THING I ASKED HER TO DO FOR ME BACK IN EARLY JUNE**, she replied with, and I quote:\n\n> I sent you the pictures the day I took them into longer have the pictures because I sent them. I told you this on the last day of school!\n\nShe flat-out lied to me. My blood was boiling. **WELL MAYBE, IF YOU REALLY DID SEND IT TO ME, I WOULDN'T HAVE NAGGED YOU NOW WOULD I?**\n\nAnd it gets better. She claims she had a problem. Problems my ass. **WELL MAYBE, IF YOU HAD A BLOODY FUCKING PROBLEM, YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME BACK IN JUNE! I'VE BEEN WAITING TWO PLUS FUCKING MONTHS FOR IT AND ONLY NOW YOU READ THIS? FUCK YOU.**\n\nMark my words, I will hunt you down personally, I will nag you in Geometry, and I will NOT stop until I get that god-forsaken email.\nThere is no reason I shouldn't have gotten it, and even looking at your bullshit and flat-out lying excuse makes me want to lift my aged 17 inch CRT computer monitor and throw it out of my bedroom window in anger. Mark my fucking words. I will even join the Navy SEALS just to make the copypasta actually happen on you for real. I would even throw jars of piss at you if we were in TF2, ya female wanking bitch of a cunt.\n\nAlright, alright, maybe part of it was my own stupidity, but still, I had to let it out at some point.\n\nEND OF RANT."

I am so damn tired of the left and the rights pointless battles taking center stage. I am so damn tired of the way all companies treat consumers and walk all over us. Specifically all this bull shit with net neutrality. I am so damn tired of people blindly following what others say and never citing their sources or branching out. Only consuming ideas that are the same as their own. I am so damn tired of all of these pointless divisions. I am twenty one years old and I am already so damn tired. I wanted a normal life. A simple job. A good companion. I wanted to work in IT. But every god damn day I see such bull shit happening and all we do is wait around hoping for change. I am far from the man smart enough and level headed enough to change the future. I am far from an activist. But god damnit if there isn't a day that goes by where I wish I had a platform to speak of how blind we are to the evils around us and how we waste our time with meaningless fights. How meaningless a lot of things are. I wish I had a button to start a conversation amongst everyone. Not the kind where when you start losing you leave the conversation because you don't want to admit you're wrong but the conversation that guides us to our potential as humanity. The way things look, the American government is not in good hands. If you're a democrat or republican and you don't agree with this statement then you are so far up your party's ass you are seeing the world in shades of red and blue. We paint colors and choose sides that represent us. We make us vs them mentalities which ultimately divide and weaken our country. We blind ourselves to the purpose of government and force our beliefs among others because that's how we want things to be. Religion has no place in government. I'm sorry. I know it's hard to hear that. However the origin of our country was spawned from us fleeing the catholic rule. We didn't want the be told what to believe so we made a free country. So in our free country we must believe and follow Christianity. That sounds free...  In our free country you cannot be gay and marry. In our free country you cannot make choices that only effect you because I am personally uncomfortable with the thought of anyone living another way than I. That sounds free. In our free country we want to put up pay walls that force people into shitty unending situations while those lucky to be where they are stay at the top. Trickle down economics. Dirty fuel. Denial of global warming and other science. Pharmaceutical companies being for profit. Police not being held accountable for misconduct. I am so damn tired of the way everything around me works. I don't know how to fix it. I don't know how to rally everyone together. I don't know if any of that is even possible. But I do know this isn't the 1900s anymore. I do know we as a species are allowing our irrelevant differences to divide us. And I know I am so damn tired of it all. \n\n\nTo the people that are going to shit and throw hate at me: \n\nWhy do you hate me? Is it because I stand for things different than your opinions? \nI do not want animosity in the comments. We are civilized are we not so let us act like it. Tell me why I'm wrong in any sense and we will discuss it. Let us have a conversation rather than a witch hunt. \n\nI really needed to say this because everyone is sick of hearing this kind of shit. But I really can't sleep at night after reading some of the shit I do. I get fired up. I just have to let it out. Thank you for making it this far in my 2 am ramblings. Have a good night. "

To no one's surprise, the discussions were infested with death cultists babbling about how she's burning in hell, often with an air of barely-contained sadistic glee.  And to no one's surprise, said death cultists quickly leapt to preaching their nonsense, trying in vain to censor contrary opinions, whining about how horribly persecuted they are because they're no longer allowed to murder anyone who disagrees with them, and issuing death threats.  \n\nAnyone who flings around threats of hell is a sociopathic monster. The world would be much better off if all the sadistic torture-fetishists who believe that sick lie just set **themselves** on fire, instead of jerking off fantasizing about setting **other people** on fire.  \n\nThe whole idea of a god who would create a torture chamber where he could burn people alive forever for his own depraved entertainment is just *so incredibly fucking sick!*  It makes that god not just evil, but **the most evil being imaginable!**  Why would anyone who isn't a depraved, sadistic piece of shit willingly choose to serve such a vile atrocity?  There is nothing that all the atheists who have ever lived or could ever live could do in ten thousand lifetimes to make christianity (and by extension islam) look more utterly foul and sick than this monstrous dogma does!  \n\nThe response to this belief among believers is pretty appalling too.  Some at least have enough conscience and compassion to be horrified by it, but not horrified enough to even consider the only moral solution to the dilemma I see (which would be **DEICIDE**, if a god that evil existed it should be exterminated immediately).  Others rationalize it, often with shades of [Stockholm Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome).  But so many just seem to **RELISH** the thought of people being burned alive!  I've lost count of the number of times I've encountered christians whose argument boiled down to \"*My imaginary friend's gonna burn you alive forever, and I can't wait to watch!!*\"   There's just something deeply disturbing about the fact that people have not only been indoctrinated to *believe* this happens, they're actually **eager** for it to happen, and consider it glorious!  \n\nThen there's the [Abominable Fancy](https://www.reddit.com/r/GrotesqueVocabulary/comments/2hqoji/abominable_fancy_the_longstanding_christian_idea/).  The idea that the unending torment of the damned would serve as **ENTERTAINMENT** for those in heaven.  *They actually came up with a name for the doctrine that people would spend eternity in \"Paradise\" watching torture-porn!*  **That is a thing that enough people believe that we need a NAME for it!!**  (*shameless plug for /r/GrotesqueVocabulary here*)\n\nSo, yeah, if you believe that your god is going to set most of the human race on fire, why not see how it feels for yourself.  If, at some point while you burn, you realize how horrible this is, and that no god who would do such a thing to people could possibly be worthy of worship, then **STOP, DROP, AND ROLL**, *maybe* you have enough basic human decency to be worth living.  If you can't find that much compassion or empathy within yourself, then you are a danger to yourself and others, and you will not be missed.  "

            "value": "I remember before I graduated back in 2010 when students were boasting how great it would be to leave High School, teachers would often make comments implying how foolish High School students are for wanting to leave. \n\nSome comments that I remember word-for-word. \nScience Teacher:\n\"Don't be eager to leave High School because years from because years from looking back you will miss your time here.\" \nPsychology Teacher:\n\"Once you enter the real world, you'll be wishing you to be back in High School.\" \nEnglish Teacher\n\"You'll wish you never said that when you enter the real world.\" \nMath Teacher\n\"If you think High School is hard, its a walk in the park compared to college. Which is itself a walk in the park compared to life.\" \nJust some but there were more said by other teachers aside from these in my final years in High School. \n\nAt the time in my Senior year I didn't care. But life experiences in the last several years after leaving High School really opened my eyes just to how much hypocrisy these teacher statements are. \nThey all state high school years are the best and we are so sheltered simply because we are \"teenagers\"? \n\nOK let me tell you something. My mother grew up in poverty. As in she couldn't afford basic things such as clothing. FUCK she had to struggle to get food and I remember she told me her youth consisted of \"going from relative to relative begging for food.\" She always told me how she used to envy her classmates who had complete sets of clothes, nice homes to live in, and FOOD to eat everyday. She only have like two-three pics of her childhood and I seen none from her teen years and its only in her college years do I spot a lot of pic sin her family album. Its only starting college she began to live decently enough for basic needs (and even then she had to fucking WORK to put food on the table while she attended college as opposed to most other girls in that age frame esp. in the West). Never has she stated positive things about her child hood year nor high school years and one of the things she always warn me is that her pre-adult years was one of poverty and going around begging relatives for help. She DOESN'T MISS her years before \"becoming an adult and entering the real world\" and she sometimes even have nightmares. I won't even dare mention much of the abuses she faced as a child namely the neglect from her family and beatings from her brothers. \n\nSo when many adults here in the United States moan and ripe about how much they miss their High School years/teen years, it already pisses me off a lot. Even more so when they state so high and mightily in such a self-righteous and self-important manner how many of us students were naive dumbasses who don't know what we're getting into when we state we want to go into the real world and that we \"don't appreciate how good and easy\" we have it. Without even  knowing any of us outside of high school. \n\nWhile I don't know any case as severe as my mother, I knew kids from High School who had to work their ass off just to support their families who are struggling financially. WHILE STUDYING in school! So these teachers literally think these kids (who should having the time of their lives\" to miss their high school years where they are making sacrifices for their families?Fucking stupid. \n\nHow about the kids who are already locked up in some sort of prison institution at least half of their time in High School such as Juvie?They're implying these kids will miss being locked up in a semi-prison when they are working? \n\nOr they're saying that many kids who faced daily hard beatings by their dads will literally miss being in their dad's home while they were attending High School long after they left and found job elsewhere? \n\nAny adults past their 30s who has this mentality of \"you'll miss your high school years, you don't know how easy being a teen is and you'll face a rude awakening when you enter the real world as adults\" are undoubtedly SHELTERED and has not experienced much, if any, in their lives. If anything I feel such adults are even hedonistic and irresponsible. Esp. if they for Christ's sake have their own ids-so they're saying they would rather relive their teen years, than live in the now and take care of their kids or solve their problems,etc? Not to mention rose-colored view cherry-picking view of the past failing to keep in mind of the stresses and hardships of living as a teen. \n\nI'm even more pissed with is the hypocrisy. Almost all people who state this-esp. teachers- HAVE NOT BECOME RICH and have meager pay nor have many of them been happily married, excelled in their careers,etc. I wonder how many of them would still keep this opinion had they won the lottery when they were in college or when they started working after graduation and became millionaires? Or if they married the person of their dreams and still live up to today INCREDIBLY HAPPY marriages only found in Romance novels? \nI really think they are only griping because they failed to succeed in the real world. I mean we don't hear mega successes like Bill Gates complaining how much they miss their teen/high school years? \n\nNevermind me putting examples of teens/kids in 3RD WORLD COUNTRIES that make the examples I put above such jokes and easy experiences. Do these teachers seriously expect us to believe everyone including kids in China working in sweatshops to have had such happy childhood and teen years they miss them and don't like the \"REAL WORLD\"? (HINT:They faced more of the \"REAL WORLD\" than most of these teachers and adults who moan and gripe ever had!). \n\nAnd even among people I know who had AWESOME teen years while acknowledging they enjoyed their High School years don't necessarily want to go back and if anything even these kids who had it easy in their childhood/teen years think its a n utter joke compared to the now. To use an example, I knew a guy from High School who was an athlete and had a fun time in High School. he is now an American Soldiers and guess what-HE LOVES BEING an AMERICAN SOLDIER and thinks its much better than back in his teen years. This is just one example hahahahahahaa. \n\nSo for many adults-esp. most teachers I met who say this with a \"higher than thou\" aura-are IMO are bunch of SHELTERED people who don't know what its like to have been starving to death and whatnot. In fact they show such hubris when they make such a broad-brush statement-esp. when they DON'T EVEN KNOW ANY OF US outside of SCHOOL!!!! Haven't they ever seen the school so of the Ghetttos which feature frequent violence and are such scary places that kids are really reluctant to go there? And many teens from these Ghetto neighborhoods can't wait to graduate from High School and leave from there because its just such bad and violent places?\n\nI can understand them saying this if they were sincere. But fuckalmost all the adults I know who say this (and esp. Most teachers) have not succeeded in life and if you met them you can feel their general outlook is that of a general feel of \"life sucks\" and pessimism! If they were truly sincere about helping students why don't they give them actual advice than telling them not to accept the inevitable? Miss our \"teen/high school years because they're the best time of our lives\" my fucking ass! Why don't they tell us the mistakes they made and warn us against committing them if they were sincere? But **** no! Most of them seem to get a rather feeling of superiority when they state this! Sheer hypocrisy BS from sheltered people who never faced daily beatings or seen kids get gunned down,etc\n\nMoreso because they often state it in a self-righteous arrogant manner as though they're trying to put us younger generations down and attempting to make themselves feel better be cause they don't like the fact they're not the billionaire Bill Gates is or they think working a relatively easy office job is so hard and think they're suffering as poor people........ Despite the fact none of them ever worked real bone breaking jobs such as coal mining or even went a full day without a single piece of food to eat!\n\nMan sorry for this big rant but this attitude just infuriates me! Especially when I think about the hard childhood my mom had!"

            "value": "First off, I have 2 brothers and my dad traveled so currently at home its just me, my 2 brothers and my mom. I'm the youngest and my second oldest brother and I have always had tension between each other. We are very different people and we have always argued with each other a lot. I'm closer to my oldest brother though but I just don't talk about my feelings about anything with anyone in my family or anyone for that matter. I've learned to just live with my second oldest brother by respecting his decisions and not trying to get in his way because in the past anytime we had arguments our parents always told us to \"iGnOrE\" each other like suddenly all our problems would go away. Nobody has ever really done anything about it and so I've \"iGnOrEd\" him but he still keeps being his immature narcissistic self. Earlier this night he was shouting something out loud when joking around with my oldest brother but it was distracting me as I was watching a youtube video with one earphone plugged into my ear because the second one doesn't work so I told him please keep quiet in a normal tone and he kept making noise and so I raised my voice and told him to please keep quiet and he suddenly got angry and began to call me hurtful names and threaten to beat me. I was taken aback by this lashing out of anger because I thought we were beyond this who would've thought Mr. entitlement would suddenly get this angry. Eventually though my mum called me to the sitting room and told me to tell her what happened and I gave her my point of view and when she asked him to tell her what happened he gave her his point of view which was something about me giving him 1 minute to keep shouting while I ignored him making noise.\nMy mom decided like she always does to tell us to ignore each other and after 30 minutes of lectures on her point of view on the situation I had a lot of things to say but I kept my anger in and I asked her if I could leave more than 3 times during this discussion and I told her that if she made me keep sitting there listening and being in an environment with my brother I would say something that I didn't want to say and naturally she told me to remain seated and so I did. Eventually I sparked and lashed out at my brother and told him that I hate him(no I don't regret telling him this and I will get to this in a bit). Now my mom looked hurt because she's all about \"BlOoD iS tHiCkEr ThAn wAtEr\" but frankly my brother and I are two different people and I've made up my mind that once I am no longer under the support of my parents I intend to lose contact with him. Why? when I was between the ages of 11 or 12 this person called my \"brother\" raped me. It's really tough for me to type this as I've never told anyone but my oldest brother and he did nothing but laugh about it. You see around those ages I barely knew anything about sex etc. so I didn't know the gravity of what was going on and looking back at age 17 right now I truly hold resentment towards him and towards my oldest brother, my closest friend for doing nothing but laugh about it. My mom and dad don't know this happened I don't intend to tell them. As much as my mom pisses me off I can't let her know that because it will crush her. As for my dad if I tell him everything will truly fall apart. Now I'm here with a family that doesn't understand with no friend in the world that knows how I feel and frankly I'm really fucking sad."

No. As I was bringing that smacktard slub her annoying dogs, I immediately gave her the leashes to her HANDS, only for her to proceed with \"can you fucking give me the God damn leashes? Thanks.\"...

Normally I'd be more understanding, but this friend is relatively flaky. There was this one time we were planning a movie night or something, and she didn't reply for *hours.* She never checks her messages or texts in general, so I had to bug her sister/roommate *through a mutual friend* to ask her what was going on. (Turns out that she had some family stuff going on, which is understandable. But it would've been nice for her to let me know.) Additionally, I had a bad experience with another friend who flaked and rescheduled on me *3 times*, so now, I'm a bit paranoid.\n\nThis is one of my best friends, and I love this girl to death, but seriously... I was all excited to meet up with her today and spent the entire afternoon > evening > night with her, especially since yesterday was her birthday, and I even got her a birthday present. But now, I'm doubtful she'll even show up...and it's a pretty crappy feeling.\n\nThe problem with being flaky is that the moment you try and tell someone you need to delay a time, the other person will doubt that you will show up. I'm a generally tardy person, so I'm usually late to events for 10-15 minutes. But at least I always make it. From now on, I'm going to start asking flaky friends \"what's the % likelihood that you'll flake/need to reschedule\" when they tell me they need to delay.\n\nTo flaky people; don't make time commitments with people unless you're sure you can clear that time for them. And if something actually comes up that takes priority, *message the person ASAP* letting them know you can't make it rather than making them have to contact you."

            "value": "I work in a supermarket (that will remain nameless) as a \"price checker\". In this particular store the responsibilities of the price checkers are largely agreed by other people in the front-end department to be some of the most stressful jobs in the front-end and even the entire store. The jobs responsibilities include making sure the front-end area floor is checked every half hour and swept every now and then and that is written into a sweep-log. This is already a stupid job because price checkers are the only people in the front-end who aren't always in the front-end at all times. Beyond that, we also have to make sure that there are enough carts inside the entrance and if there aren't we have to go outside and bring carts in from the cart corrals. There are people who are in charge of carts but they don't come in until 11:00 so before then the price-checkers are in charge of them. Then beyond that we have to make sure that the stuff that customers leave at the tills, which is a lot of stuff, is put away back onto the shelves. Most of the time we have two to four carts overflowing with crap that people didn't buy from the previous day and we have to put it away. This gets very frustrating when you don't know where anything goes and you're stuck looking for it all. Then beyond all that we have to make sure that damaged products get put into their proper locations to be written up and disposed of. AND THEN on top of ALL of that crap we have a phone with us at all times and this phone is called whenever customer service or a cashier has a question that usually involves going to where a product is and checking the price of it because the customer expected it to be a different price, hence the title, \"price checker\". And finally if we run into a customer who wants to know where a product is we have to tell them where it is and more often than not it's something that we either don't have or something obscure that I've never heard of. Now it sounds like we'd have a whole team of people doing these jobs, maybe three or more, because this is a lot of responsibilities but nope. There are two price-checkers who work mornings and neither of us work all week so often times I am alone doing ALL of that crap. It's the most stressful thing when I'm trying to do something and I get a call and they ask for something and then as soon as I get off the phone to do that thing I get another call asking for another thing so I have to keep track of who wanted each thing and what they wanted and then when I'm off the phone with them I get another call asking for something completely different and then by the time I get all of that done an hour has passed and the sweep-log was never done and there are no carts outside. AND I HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO THE THING I'M ANGRY ABOUT! Earlier today, I had a conversation with a customer that somehow got to him saying how easy my job looked and how little work I was doing. This hurt me a little because I was doing quite a bit of work and things were only JUST starting to calm down. He even had the nerve to tell a colleague of mine who was in charge of doing carts that he should have my job even though my job IS his job but with more crap tacked onto it! He said that he saw me just walking up and down the aisles doing nothing and this made me furious inside because I have been doing some of the hardest work I've done in my life the last week and this dude just comes in and judges me for slowing down a little and taking it easy after an already stressful day. I then tried to explain to this guy that I have a lot of responsibilities and everyone agrees that my job is one of the hardest jobs and he had the nerve to say \"Yeah, it must be really hard hiding from the boss\". He said this all so nonchalantly and framed it like a joke but it was clear he meant what he was saying and was trying to make a playful and, at least as he thought, harmless jab at my job. This pissed me off and I was powerless to say anything because I was at work and would get in trouble if I spoke poorly to a customer, but I wanted to rip his head off I was so internally infuriated. I don't think I'm unjustified saying that I am overworked and underpayed at my job because I do all of that stuff, which is more than anyone else has to do at the store aside from the managers, and I get payed a paltry minimum wage which is way too tiny and all it took was one person making a joke to make me realize just how unappreciated my job really is. And this one dude is just so close-minded and judgmental to someone who he doesn't know crap about. He doesn't know the crap I deal with on a daily basis, he just sees me walking down an aisle and assumes I'm not doing anything and \"hiding from my boss\" which is just ridiculous. It hurts me to know that it doesn't matter how much work I put in I'm going to be told I'm not doing well enough and that sucks."

Anyways, yeah, it's my own fault for letting someone like him defraud me. Anyways, yeah, I handed over the tickets, after he wasted a month of my time, and he never paid me a dime. In November, he called me to say he was sorry, and would need to pay it over 3 installments, the first arriving via paypal shortly. I waited about a month, then sent him a paypal invoice for the whole amount, growing tired of him not following through. Now he won't return my calls or texts. I don't get it, we'd been friends for 20+ years, and he's making *me* feel like the asshole for simply wanting to get what is mine? How can people just cut you out when they owe you money. Pisses me off. "

Usually my younger brother pays for these rides but this month he warned me that he wouldn't be able to do so because his car broke down and all his funds went to fixing it. Needing a solution I purchased a $25.00 Uber eGift Card online on Aug. 9th and the next day purchased another for an additional $10.00; this gives me $35.00 in credit to use through/with Uber. Today I got an e-mail from Uber Eats advertising for new customers. They offered $15.00 off the first meal for new users - a deal I couldn't let go by. I decided on Panda Express but when looking through the menu realized it wasn't set up for me to order how I typically would if I had gone in to order. So I order 1 (one) Bigger Plate (as it's called) for $10.00, 1 (one) side of Chow Mein for $1.10 and 1 (one) Large Entree of Black Pepper Chicken for $6.60. Simple enough right? Wrong. My Chow Mein came to $4.40 and my Black Pepper Chicken came to $11.00 before taxes! My order, including tax - booking fee $4.99 - $15.00 off - still came to $17.49. Now I had connected my Uber to my Uber Eats and after I had taken a ride that cost $15.85, I had $19.15 left from my $35.00. If you subtract Panda's $17.49 from my remaining credit $19.15 you get $1.65. Simple right? Obviously I was overcharged roughly $8.75 when you add up overcharges and the new tax which means I should have roughly $10.20 in my credits. Naturally I contact Uber Eats and tell them about this mistake. The first thing the girl says to me is that I'm not on the same page as her because I paid for nothing, my meal used my credits. I tell her I purchased those credits and she tells me she wants proof. I send her both eCards and both of my banks confirmation emails. Great right? Wrong, she tells me she still can't figure out how I've come to the conclusion I've been over charged. Now mind you, I have sent my receipt with a full break down despite it being very self explanatory. I think, at this point, there's nothing left to prove and no room for confusion since I have gone beyond to prove my point but ahhh at last I am still wrong. Now she wants me to, after she has verified my remaining credit balance of $1.65, to explain where the roughly $8.75 extra is coming from. When I first contacted Uber Eats I thoroughly explained this with pictures, then I did it again, once more and before posting this... Yes, you can guess it, one more time! How can anyone be this dumb? It's baffling and beyond frustrating. I just hope the next message is her finally getting it because I've been explaining this crap\u200b for over 8 hours now and I can't take any more stupidity."

You may or may not believe in this conspiracy theory. Whatever. I don't agree or disagree, but what I KNOW is that commercial, passenger aircraft are not hiding chemical tanks in their turbines while they fly you home to see your mommy for Christmas. They just aren't. It isn't happening. Fucking think about it for a second. If the government were spraying anything it would be from military craft. A; Nothing is getting sprayed through turbines to be inconspicuous. Why risk millions of dollars in damage when you could easily spray in literally any other way that will not corrode the engines? B.; Seriously commercial aircraft are not fucking spraying chemicals learn how science works. But people believe this shit because of YouTube videos and Facebook posts, completely ignoring any evidence that refutes it and yet saying you are the one who is close minded. Really? People will believe any bullshit that they read on the internet and call these fucking blogs and videos their \"research\" and tell you to do \"yours.\" What's the point? It's all bullshit anymore. \n\nEver heard of the Gutenberg Parenthesis? It's the age of communication marked by written word versus word of mouth. Prior to the invention of the printing press, stories, facts, news and all education was passed from person to person via oral tradition. This left room for people to put there own spin on things like a big game of telephone. Then came published works, which, for a while, had some sort of credibility, at least when it came to legitimate news sources and educational sources. The printing press was the beginning of the parenthesis, the internet is the end. Imagine it like this:\n\nOral tradition/word of mouth(Legitimate fact checked information)Bullshit Facebook news stories that everyone believes.\n\nBasically, we've reverted to a primitive mode of communication. Even once reputable news outlets, such as Time and New York TImes have resorted to \"5 Reasons Why Your Selfies are Making You Smarter,\" or \"These Sunglasses Connect To Your Phone So You Don't Lose Them!\" Click bait is everywhere, and everyone is quick to believe everything they read. \"Omg! A snow snake that instantly freezes your blood!\" No. Bullshit. \"OMG! KIDS ARE SMOKING BEDBUGS!\" No. An April fools prank by a news station. \"BILL GATES IS DONATING 5 DOLLARS FOR EACH SHARE THIS PICTURE GETS!\" No. He isn't.\n\nI do my part to help point out which of these stories are real, and which ones are bullshit through research that usually doesn't have to go further than snopes to debunk it. But you know what? I quit.\n\nYou stupid motherfuckers have put the \")\" on the Gutenberg Parenthesis. You have brought about the end of any kind of credibility of information, and possibly the apocalypse (unconfirmed.) All I know is that if you fucking idiots want to be primitive, paranoid, and ignorant, who am I to stand in your way? Even though there are plenty of REAL things to get worked up about and argue about and spread around to raise awareness, by all means, chose to spend your time and energy on the bullshit. You know what's really scary? Aids. Cancer. Prejudice. *Everything in Australia. Poverty. Hate crime. *Zombies. The fact that women STILL don't get paid as much as men. The fact that not everyone in this country can marry who they love legally. Starvation.\n*Spiders.\n\n(*-Shouldn't actually be on this list.)\n\nFocus your time and energy on real things that you can actually do something about, not bigfoot and how 9/11 was an inside job.\n\nSo, you win, you fucking assholes.\n\nI quit. Go fuck yourself. I'm sure there's an article out there somewhere that proves it increases your IQ.\n"

Common fucking sense, you keep the hot air out all day and let in the cool air at night. Simple logical shit, right?\n\nEvidently fucking not. My roommate insists on having his (only) bedroom window and the hallway window open all day. We've had the same conversation six times already. Each time I gently and respectfully explain that it is a 100% verifiable fact that the air outside is hotter than the air inside, and that he is letting that hot outside air in. Each time he says 'well, that's just your opinion. This gives me a cross breeze.' And while I admit that a breeze may be nice, we own literally six fans and three AC window units that he can choose from to get a cross breeze that doesn't heat the entire rest of the godforsaken house. Also, that's not an opinion! That's 100% grade-A USDA certified fact!\n\nMaybe this sounds petty and stupid. Maybe you've always had central air.

About \u202a#\u200ebearingwithness\u202c to \u202a#\u200eClimateChange\u202c.\n\n\nI woke up the day after a baby shower that went as damn near perfect as baby showers go. The weather was beautiful that day. At 5 in the morning 50 mph gusts of wind tore through the area, speckled by snow. The next day had thundershowers, the like of which you only typically experience when you're south of I-4 in Florida, the typical demarkment of America's sub-tropical zone. This morning, I awoke to big fat gravid snowflakes. And I got really, really angry.\n\n\nI grew up reading stories about how new fatherhood can clean up a junkie from the depths of addiction, how it can make selfish boys transform into men, how new fatherhood makes you re-evaluate your relationship with family and governance and posterity. That's not what I get. I got ominous weather. A portentious underscoring the major dysfunctions of how the world works.\n\n\nI haven't been a great environmentalist in every aspect of my existence. I bought cars, gas to fill those cars. I buy plastic half gallon containers of shit. I continue to eat meat, that I buy, sourced from vendors I don't know. I compost, as best as my environment allows. But for each increment of being a better environmentalist as an individual person, it struck me that to really do it right, I had to make more money. Get the solar going, grow the food, get a hybrid car. The very real facts of my situation were that I didn't make enough money to take the steps necessary to cut out the bad decisions and opt for the better ones. I was priced out. The only way to get to the place where you can make the better decisions is to be a part of the problem. There is no way out of being poor that doesn't require stepping all the fuck over nature, and you have to make peace with it, or choose not to survive or thrive and give up.\nI watch the snows flurry down on this beautiful April day, and in my fuming mind I think of the job at Florida fish and wildlife, where I watched as part of the Nassau river die over the course of a year. At low tide, the water would boil with life, mullet skipping, half airborn across the top of creeks, as there just wasn't enough liquid to contain the bounty of life there. I would think about how easy it would have been to eke an existence out in this environment as a community based on foraging. Food and beauty were plentiful. And as the development went up on the spartina flats, the lowtide river became as still as stale soup stock. And it won't ever be the same.\n\n\n\nI wasn't going to ever be a father then, but that loss was significant. And then I think about how I had a manuscript I wrote get tabled by the consulting firm at which I worked because I insinuated that the ranged extension of this one specific species of fish into NJ waters had to do with warming water temperatures. It was tabled because the vice president of an environmental consulting firm didn't believe that climate change existed. A multimillionaire who was dumber than most of the pothead line cooks I had worked with. But maybe I was conflating dumb and selfish. This was a final disenchantment from a firm that paid me to comply with terribly constructed activities pasted together and called \"science\" for the benefit of regulatory compliance for an energy company named like a transformer villain. \n\n\nI could have just continued collecting those paychecks, but each new installment of what felt like bloodmoney traded for my integrity, wound up being saved. And then blown. On what should have been a purgative trip to teach science to kids in Tanzania. Only to find that the dysfunction is global, and the people causing it were basically the same.\n\n\nAnd then, for some reason, my mind races to watching Captain Planet and Sesame Street as a little kid. Not because of the clear environmental themes that ran through them, but because there were people there making the decision to talk to kids about climate change because the fucking adults wouldn't listen. There were livlihoods generated by that collectivist art/education system. The artists of those programs, typically derided as hippies or lit majors, took their tool set, believed the scientists over the plutocrats, and delivering the message to the children. Hoping that in their capacity, with the vocation that they can tolerate the most, that maybe 15 years later, something would budge. It's been thirty fucking years, and nothing has budged.\n\n\nPeople got rich and stayed rich by denying the climate change science of the 1980s. And they're still fucking rich today. Their kids pay senators to keep everything running smoothly. And it's snowing outside while it's sunny outside. And we were fucking warned about this. And we're just as powerless to end it as we were as 4 year olds. And the derided liberals and artists and academics are all getting shit on the same way that they used to back then, because what they want has no intrinsic monetary value. And no amount of screaming alters the fact that monetary value has no intrinsic benefit if it cannot prevent worldwide environmental degradation.\n\n\nAnd it is going to get worse. Climate change is a process that will develop exponentially from here on out.

And the system that relies on that. And the leaders of the system who protect that means of operating. And the cronies who buy off those leaders.\n\n\nMaybe something will budge in 15 more years."

It may be better to hear me than read this blabber: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-dvaU2SH-c\n\nYou\u2019re getting out of senior year in highschool, and your parents, teachers, even the fucking counselor is nagging you to choose where to go to college\u2026 \n\nI know what you\u2019re gonna say, \u201cDude, it wasn\u2019t hard, I just had to go to freshman orientation, then I filed appointments with the department for undergraduates, seen the advisor for LAS, set up classes, sent in tax info\u2026\u201d\n\nSee what I mean? It\u2019s bullshit how much we have to do to get into an institution that doesn\u2019t even grant an easy way to graduation 4 or 5 years later. No wonder, my college has a 44% graduation rate! \n\nAnyway, let\u2019s get to the point here. My pet peeve for an institution is the access. The way in which you enter the circle\n\nRegistration into college seems self explanatory. You do almost exactly what was said before, and yeah, it all looks easy. But back up. Let\u2019s take a look at where your information gets taken, which may be the registration office, but like most people, you will most likely go to the university website and send your information, such as tax records from you, your parents, a dependent form, a housing form, and whatever the fuck they ask of you.\n\nNow, like any great institution, it all revolves around money. But HERE\u2019S WHY SHIT GOES DOWN (John Cena theme). In order for you to put in your tax information, you need to usually get it through the IRS, which gets so much flak from the American people. This reason is because the IRS is one of the most under-funded departments of the U.S. government, and it\u2019s a travesty, because WHO THE FUCK WOULD WANT TO TAKE AWAY MONEY FROM THE PLACE THAT SUPPORTS THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY?!\n\nSorry, I got heated for a second. \n\nThe worst part about all of this is the truth. You pay your hard-earned (non-existant or existant) money to go to a university, go into debt, get a job to pay for said university, and hopefully after all the socio-pathic bullshit that you went through to learn enough to get a degree, you can get a higher paying job catered to your area of study. \n\nAccording to capitalism, it all makes sense. But according to common sense, any political theory has its flaws. This may seem to look like I\u2019m wandering into political territory, but I needed to explain that to create the reason behind why registering for college is counter-intuitive in a couple of ways.\n\nThe simple fact that the IRS is under-funded is the reason why it takes so long to register for school, plus the fact that, since you are most likely responsible for taking on financial burdens during your college career, you will need financial aid, and you will need a job. The only problem is that the average person doesn\u2019t qualify for the money to fund their class load, extra-curriculars, gas for your car, groceries, bills and other expenses, like class materials. And It only gets worse if you live outside of your parents\u2019 house!\n\n(Sigh) Another thing that pisses me off is the \u201cfees\u201d part. Like, who the fuck wants to pay a 50$ fee for going to an integral event at the college you\u2019re attending. I know it takes time and money for the institution to muster up the event, but it\u2019s a given, so you wouldn\u2019t expect to see a nice little bill on your account! \n\nParking permits\u2026 Oh my God. Someone please tell me why it\u2019s a legitimate business to make students buy a 150$ pass to park in a lot, for registration, to go to fucking school. That\u2019s just a novelty little shit in the bag of treats you\u2019re given when going to get your degree. Not to mention, one parking permit is good for a single school year.\n\nClass registration is essential to get ready for the school year, but it comes with all the hoops no one wants to jump through. Permits, fees, class extras, class hours, tax information, technical difficulties, miscommunications between offices, appointments and just the simple lack of power are enough to piss me off. That being said, I have to register for school, although\u2026 I\u2019m very tempted to just leave and keep working my ass off at my minimum wage job to move out in the next few years.\n\nOh yeah, and thanks to Kansas legislation, education budget cuts and weird tax laws, tuition for school should go up in price\u2026"

I forgot my debit card and I did not have any cash with me. Despite not having cash, i used the toll road and was planning to request the person to just give me a ticket or receipt that enables me to pay online / mail when I am back home. I stop at the toll gate and request him nicely to give me a receipt that allows me to pay later. He immediately starts saying 'Shame! Shame! Shame on you! You are a middle aged man with no money on you. Do you know that I have 100-200$ in my pocket right now?' I am flabbergasted and completely caught off balance. To top it off, I am on the car phone with my boss. I work for a prestigious strategy consulting firm and she is listening to all this and I am embarrassed completely. Then the old man says 'If you had to go buy drugs, how do you do it if you have no cash?' to which I reply 'I have never used drugs and so I dont know the answer to your question'. Then he literally shoves an enevlope at me and says 'Make sure you pay it on time or else you couuld be slapped with a 50$ fine'. I say 'thank you' and drive on.\n\nI was involved in account planning sessions all afternoon after I reached Dresher, PA but the incident kept coming back to me and I had shivers of shame and rage going down my spine. What right does he have to say that I should be ashamed for not carrying cash? I was not trying to be difficult at all and i thought it was perfectly legal and acceptable if I paid later on. Why did he assume that i use drugs and what right does he have to ask me how I would pay for drugs?\n\nI am fuming and need to do something. "

There was this guy who would always walk by our houses, and he would walk back and forth in front of hers. This guy, according to her mom, had started doing this recently and would put his hands on the gate and try to talk to A. Her mom had told her when A sees him, to run inside. At this point it had happened about 5 or 6 times.\n\nOne day soon after that, my mom and her mom were sitting in my neighbors yard shooting shit while I played with her. This guy came by again, only this time got onto my lawn to come and talk to her. My mom seeing this immediately says something like, \" Hey you, do not get on my lawn, get out of here or we will call the cops.\" So he left.\n\nThis is where I got fed up. The cops can't do anything, he's not a registered sex offender, yet. But I knew this had to stop, A could not be afraid to play in her own front yard.\n\nSo about a week later, I got off the bus from school with kids from my neighborhood, and as we get to our street, he turns the corner behind us. Unfortunately, my bus friends were immature and were teasing him, calling him chicken, I already was angry with him, so I didn't stop it. Instead I yelled at him to stay away from this street, stay away from A.\n\nThis is where he attacked me. So I'm a girl, I'm a foot shorter, but I played soccer since I was 5 and I took taekwondo for 2 years. He didn't know this, but he bragged that he was a black belt. So this cat tried to take me out by slamming both of my hands into my ears. It didn't have the affect he wanted, so next he tried to kick me in the nether regions. Again, I'm a girl, so it didn't hurt, also my adrenaline was up. While his foot was stuck up, I grabbed it, twisted it around, forcing him to fall on his knees and hit the ground, jammed my knee into his back and told him, if he ever comes on this street again, I will hurt him.\n\nHe hasn't been on this street since. \n\nBut why I'm angry is that I see him all the time, walking around on every street but ours. I have no proof that he is a potential pedophile, so that means that if he does come on our street again and I touch him, he can press charges, the most I can do is tell him to stay off our property. I don't want him around, I can't protect the other kids on the block that I don't know, and I can't go around telling people he is a potential pedophile without proof.\n\n\nThanks for listening, I feel a little better."

Bitch, REMEMBER YOUR KEY NEXT TIME. \n\nI am so looking forward to break right now, in fact I am leaving the last day possible so I can have to room to myself for once and be able to relax in peace.

I'm pissed that my dad seems OK about the whole thing. \"We'll just write it off.\" is all he can manage to say about it. For starters we're not a well off family that can throw money around. They make enough to comfortably live on and had the money that they used to by the car in savings for a long time. It wasn't just a vehicle and it wasn't just some object to be had. It was something that i had seen for years, something that had been a topic of argument between my parents for years and all just so it could be stolen from under us. \n\nThe worst part is we're pretty sure the neighbors did it and can't do anything about it. The guy's got another address listed in his name that is an auto body shop, he's got 2-3 Camaros himself, and the first thing the asshole does when we bring up being robbed is the camaro in the garage even though we had never mentioned it to him before and it had been put into the garage at night in a very dark neighborhood.\n\nI'm just livid about this whole situation."

Several gunmen, unconfirmed number of casualties, etc etc. \n\nLike every other thread similar to that one, there will be many people denouncing terrorists and expressing their hatred for them...and then there will be people saying that we shouldn't be angry at the terrorists, that we should forgive and forget, that violence against them is wrong and that the best thing we can do is continue to live our lives as if nothing happened in order to show them that their terror has no effect, otherwise they win.\n\nAnd that right there is the catalyst for this post. That's the fly in my soup, the gum in my hair, and the fire-breathing hell-spawned spider demon crawling right up my fucking dick hole: **\"otherwise they win\"**.\n\nIf you think that's how this works and/or if you have ever preached similar turn-the-other-cheek bullshit, let me tell you something right now: They \"win\" by killing people, not by forcing people to retaliate. It's that simple.\n\nWhat the fuck kind of logic is that? Do you seriously think that's their ultimate goal? To soil your moral code? No asshole, this isn't a movie. Real terrorists aren't like the joker in The Dark Knight, trying to make a statement about the human condition. **Real terrorists just want to kill you and kill your family and destroy everything you've ever known and loved.** Plain and fucking simple. You're a goddamn moron if you think they care about our morality. \n\nFor fuck's sake, they probably don't even share the same moral code as we do. To them, fighting for your beliefs is respectable...so by being passive you're not really proving anything to them. **They will NOT be deterred by your pacifism.** They don't see you as brave or magnanimous. If anything, the terrorists see you as weak and helpless and scared to stand up for yourself. And the rest of us see you as retarded and sanctimonious. The only people who see you as \"morally superior\" are the other cunts who already believe your shit.\n\nThe fact that you spew your toxic bullshit about \"continuing to live a normal life\" is irresponsible at best and downright evil at worst. Some people don't give a shit about morals (religious or otherwise), and they would rather be safe than be...I don't know...what do you call yourselves...honorable? Tolerant? Love thy neighbour?\n\nNo you fuckass, people won't continue to put themselves in danger just so you can feel good about yourself. You and all of your shit-for-brains, holier-than-thou friends can put your own fucking lives in danger if you really want to make a point, but don't try to drag everyone else along with you.\n\nAnd when you *do* decide to go, you'll get wiped the fuck off the face of this earth along with your shitty genes and your cancerous ideals. Nobody will miss you, and hey even the terrorists will benefit because they love easy targets.\n\nWhen enough of you shit stains die or shut the fuck up, we will finally be able to deal with terrorism properly: **with force**. Yeah, fighting fire with fire might not be the best solution, but fighting fire by laying down in its path and hoping it will change its mind is so laughably naive that you would get sent to a mental institution for suggesting it...and yet there are millions of you mouth breathers who believe that this is how the world works.\n\nSo, on behalf of all non-imbecilic people who know that being safe is infinitely more important than complying with an arbitrary set moral codes: go fuck yourselves and kindly shut the fuck up."

It's like the \"likes\" on facebook. Recently, one of my friends was absolutely bullied on a facebook page, and the bullying comments got loads of likes.

I'm sad, I'm angry and I want to be strong for my family but I'm only 20 and I've no idea how the fuck I'm supposed to deal with a situation like this. \n\nALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis if you haven't heard of it) is a fucking horrible disease - it causes death of motor neurons which are the things that control muscle movement for your body. My dad was diagnosed with this sometime in 2015, and I remember my family letting me know on June 28th of that year because it's really taken me on an emotional trip since then.\n\nShitty fucking ALS facts:\n\nIn Europe and the United States the disease affects about two people per 100,000 per year. Guess we sure fucking won the lottery, didn't we? \n\nThe cause is not known in 90% to 95% of cases, and about 5\u201310% of cases are inherited from a person's parents (with my fucking terrible luck I can just assume I'll have ALS at this point) \n\nIt's NOT fucking curable. There is a drug that MAY extend the persons life by up to 3 months. Too bad we couldn't afford it!\n\n\nMy dad has been withering away for the past year and a half because of this disease and I've fucking hated every second of it. Why the FUCK does it have to be now, and why the FUCK does it have to be him? I would honestly rather be the one dying right now because nothing good has come out of my time on this planet. I genuinely feel fucking worthless. I had to drop out of school to take care of him because tasks that may be mundane to the rest of us became a really fucking big problem for him since he can't use his hands or legs.... \n\nNow during my time as a dropout I really ~~wanted~~ NEEDED a part time job to support the family because money is tight for us (and because I really wanted to earn money for that drug I mentioned above). Unfortunately, everyone has it out to get me and refuses to hire a kid with no experience though I'm an honor student with the best of intentions. Grocery stores won't hire me. Fast food chains won't hire me. NOBODY will fucking hire me... and now it's too fucking late. \n\nOne of the things that pisses me off the most is the fact that my dad had a reason to live. He loved music - he dedicated the past ~60 years of his life to it and has played in many bands and wrote many songs. It sure is a good thing ALS killed off his ability to play the guitar! \n\nOn the other hand, I live for nothing. The only things I ever do are study, be unemployed, and play video games. I'm contributing nothing to the world and I feel like I'm a colossal waste of life. My dad lived to make people happy with his music - he of all people doesn't deserve any of this. \n\nMy mom doesn't deserve this. She's been strong but she's going to fall apart any moment... I can tell she hurts when I talk to her...\n\nMy sister doesn't deserve this. She's a couple years younger than me and she's a very emotional person so this is going to hurt her beyond belief. Not to mention her birthday is coming up within the week... like \"Happy Birthday! Dad is dying!\"... what kind of sick fucking joke is this... \n\nNow me... I probably deserve this for wasting my life... but it's too fucking cruel to everyone else in my family to have them suffer like this. They're genuinely good people and I can't describe how much I love them and how much I'm thankful for them... why did it have to be us...\n\n\nMy whole life I've believed that there's some greater being because I truly wanted to believe death isn't the end. At this point though, I'm giving up. There's no fucking way there's a benevolent god out there when life has decided to fuck my family over this horribly. And if there is? I only want to say FUCK YOU for taking him and not me.\n"

I swear if I hear the \"she was asking for it\" excuse from any man, I will kick their teeth out, and say \"oh sorry, you were asking for it\" . A girl can go out in public fucking naked, she can be flashing her vagina to every fucking person around and not be asking for it! Rapist have no excuse, what you wanted to get your dick wet, so you forced yourself on someone who didn't want it. Like wtf, sex is on such a high pedestal that people will literally force people to do it. I don't care what's happening in your life, there is no excuse for raping someone! You're not a fucking animal. You control your primal urges to mate, unlike animals. Meaning (for you simple fucks who don't understand that sex isn't yours to take) you are in complete control of your actions. You are a piece of shit if you rape someone. Simple. How about you go fuck yourself instead of force fucking someone who doesn't want you. "

Now this doesnt seem to be a problem for others, as they can just hack it up, which I for some reason don't know how to do. See what I mean about this maybe not being a real 'problem?' My mother doesnt even seem to care or think much of it. I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA HOW SHES SO BLIND!!!!!!!!!!!! I have had this happen to me during soccer practice MANY FUCKING TIMES and it hurts to see everyone staring at me. Its been YEARS and ive scoured the Internet looking to see if people have had the same issues. I found that they have, but I don't see any sort of solution. \n\nWhen the phlegm bothers me, it really sucks. Its happened to me in school, causing me to become super anxious and even break out in cold sweats. The only way to counter this ive found is to keep my throat very still until it goes away, or get some hot water to let me swallow it easier, or the hard way: puking it up, sometimes with food (if ive eaten) and then I still have to keep still due to whatever the fuck is left in my throat. \n\nThis isnt the only thing making me puke. This second thing is even more incredulous as an actual 'problem.' When I do physical things like running or sports I have to be careful to not let my throat go dry. Maybe Ive been conditioned to throw up whenever my throat is agitated, but this makes me throw up too.\n\nIve had to quit things I love such as track and soccer, and my mother doesnt even seem to give two fucks.

I had just taken my family out to eat a half hour away from home, because there are no decent restaurants in my town. On the way back, I asked my seven year old if she wanted ice cream. She says yes, so I told her I would stop at McDonald's on the way back. I parked and walked in by myself, because the drive thru was backed up around the opposite side of the building. Wife and kids stayed in the car. After a minute of standing around staring at the menu, being ignored, I was told by the stoned kid behind the counter that he would be with me in a min. Another min goes by, and I was told by some \"lady\" that she would be with me in a min. Finally, the stoned kid comes up and takes my order. \"Yes, I'd like two Oreo McFlurries and a chocolate chip cookie, please.\" \"Ok, so two chocolate chip cookies and one McFlurry?\" \"No, two McFlurries and one cookie.\" So he proceeds to scrape the last chocolate chip cookie off the pan and makes conversation about how I was getting the last one, and it was a good thing I didn't order two. I said politely, \"Yeah, I guess it's a good thing some kid behind me doesn't want one, because they would be out of luck.\" Never mind there was no kid behind me or anyone for that matter. He begins to ramble about how he has to make more cookies, but that's OK, because he's convinced that I ordered two, even though the receipt reads one. He tells me it will be about three minutes, because he has to go make more. Meanwhile, he disappears to the back and wanders back up front mumbling something and is told by his manager to go make fries. He comes back several minutes later with no cookies and goes to make the McFlurries. That's when two little girls about 6 or so wander up and ask for ice cream. Instead of making my order, he takes another from them. Then he makes my McFlurries. Before doing so, he asks what kind they were supposed to be, because he's too stoned to remember and doesn't want to look at the receipt. McFlurries then hit the counter, but no cookies. He walks off and is gone for a good two minutes. Then he two little girls decide to grab my ice cream that was on the counter and start sliding it around, stick their faces over it and try to take it. I said abruptly and admittedly in a stern and loud tone, \"Get your hands off my ice cream!\" They were shocked, and one told the other, \"he's just joking.\" I said, \"no I'm not.\" Then I knew things were out of control, and I flew out the door mumbling obscenities to myself. I got in the car and started to take off. That's when I had the bright idea(not so bright now thinking back on what happened next,) to take a picture of the \"call this number to bitch\" sign. The manager then starts waving her hands around taunting me from inside, and I walked in and asked her to step to the side to talk to me. Of course by this time, the redneck parents and their friends are all up front at the counter having a meltdown over the situation, because the girls are crying. The manager told me she wasn't allowed to leave the store, much less with someone she doesn't know who seems as dangerous as me. I told her I was asking her nicely to talk to me to the side as not to cause more of a scene that there was already. She followed me over at that point, and the redneck mom interrupts and asks me if I ordered M&M McFlurries, because that's what her kids had asked for. I said, \"negative,\" I had Oreo. Being as how the girls had grabbed for my Oreo ice creams in fact, she then flips her shit and calls me Asinine. I was about to tell her something really smart ass, when her 350 lb male companion told me I had better just not say anything. I told him he had better not threaten me. Then he repeated it, and so did another one of the posse, and I told them they had better all quit threatening me. Yes, I take \"you had just better not say anything\" as a threat. The situation was escalated to that point. I talked to the manager and told her that #1, it was gross that her restaurant was so filthy(ice cream machine was a wreck,) and #2, her employees needed hair nets and hats. She informed me that that is no longer a law in my county, and I told her I guess I'm ignorant on the subject. With here classic misconception of the word \"ignorant,\" she then got huffy and told me I said that, not her. Whatever. I was admitting to being uninformed. I figured right then and there it was not worth it to continue, and I left. Before I get told that kids will be kids and not to be hard one them, my kids don't do shit like that for the reason that I have taught them better. Also, I don't need your kids touching my food and my kids' food with their unwashed hands while there is flu and norovirus running around town. We just went through two weeks of being sick. What the fuck is so hard about teaching your kids some manners, and why do people want to start screaming at strangers and threatening them to not say anything and just take being bitched at. I didn't make your kids cry. Their lack of manners got them into a situation that caused them to be upset with a stranger's reaction. Fuck this town!"

He doesn't treat girls nice because he knows we are replaceable. AND THE DUMB THING IS HE IS SO GAY.

I do not believe in per say, I just want to state that before I start this. I do ponder if possibly some shootings were fake to spark gun control talks, especially the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, where-as hour-long detailed videos practically proved that the shooting was clearly fake.\n\nI want to use my icon and, sadly slain, beloved role-model Christina Grimmie as an example for what I am about to bring up. As most of you probably know, Grimmie was a singer, and she was senselessly shot and killed by a gunman during a meet & greet event for her fans shortly after her concert at a music venue. This was on June 10, 2016, the day just before the mass shooting-terrorist attack that would also take place in Orlando, Florida - at Pulse Night Club.\n\nNow, I am definitely not saying that I believe that Christina Grimmie's shooting and death was in anyway a false flag attack - that is just moronic. BUT, it does boggle my mind sometimes - that it is almost 2017 now. Everybody is no doubt constantly on their phones - taking pictures & selfies, snapping... yet... not even one image or video is released from the incidents? Not one drop of blood recorded from the Pulse attack? There seriously is not ONE PHOTO, ONE VIDEO from ANYONE even just minutes or seconds before Christina Grimmie was shot to death? Nobody was recording the person that they had come to see perform? There's really only one single video of her final performance that night?\n\nAlso - not one fan or witness has spilled their experience about it yet? The best we have is a hot dog vendor that was outside when it happened and came in and saw the two bodies? SHE WAS SHOT IN FRONT OF PROBABLY DOZENS OR MORE PEOPLE.\n\nWhen something like that happens, there should be an out-pour of people sharing their story and/or uploading what they caught on camera. YET NOTHING?\n\nAnd don't give me BS about the government or internet not allowing gore or violence like that to be shared - because the Brussel's Truck attack was pretty damn brutal and gory.\n\nBack in the day when we had what was probably ACTUAL mass shootings, we got TONS OF FOOTAGE - tons of evidence. Columbine is a perfect example. There was no debate on the gunmen/perpetrators and how they operated, there was no arguing the American public was grown up enough to see children being shot...\n\nI really don't even want to get into how credible most hoax theories are surrounding some of these shootings, but I will cite just one or two examples from Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. If you want the full evidence that it was actually probably fake, see it out yourself on the internet. We, the people, have asked multiple times, have pried, have made it clearly noticeable - our attempts to ask for real proof, any proof that the Sandy Hook massacre was real. There is an offer out for MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to anyone involved, ANYONE, that can give one single shred of proof that whoever was involved was real - that they weren't all actors and that they really were real kids from families that died - and the offer still is there, even as of now. Completely unanswered, not cared to respond to.\n\nIf you think Trump is scary? Well maybe we should be looking at the full picture.\n\nWhere is all of the evidence?\n\nPlease share this.\n\n#answerthequestion #giveustherealnews #giveusproof\n\n#RIPChristina"

If not, maybe just read my last paragraph. \n\nI feel like nowadays, everyone is touchier. I have always been careful about everything I do and say. I'm ultra polite and professional, so much so that people comment on it sometimes. I mention this as a preface.\n\nI went through one professional grad program, but pulled out partway through since I decided the line of work wasn't for me. As things moved on, I encountered people in power over me who would take offence to the most innocuous things... and would act super unprofessional. For example, someone would be one minute late to a class, and you get a snarky remark (even if you're early every day for 3 months). One guy was legit sick one day, had to go to the washroom, and was reemed out for \"faking it\" to \"get out of participation\". I faced similar kinds of treatment. But then classmates faced a divide too, and some even went to faculty to tattle on other students (ex. you make a little complaint, they remember it, and then gossip back to the professor). I was careful, but it wore me down. This was in the teaching field... there was so much talking behind backs, childish behaviour of adults, and total lack of ethical behaviour from faculty.\n\nBut then I move on. I'm in a completely different field, I'm still a student, and I'm moving forward. I get to my first real intermediate class, and what do you know?! More unprofessional behaviour that is slapping me in the face. We had a study group to discuss ideas for our projects, everyone agreed on most questions, and we left. We all talked via WhatsApp, agreements were made, we corrected each other on mistakes anyone was making, and we all felt happy about things. This wasn't a plagiarism group, just talking about how to approach questions. Marks come around 2 weeks later and wouldn't you know it? Half of the group aced the project, and submitted answers that were different from what we discussed as a group... meaning I spent a bunch of time helping everyone out, and some of those people sat and listened and didn't share their own info (knowing full-well I had 2 questions wrong out of 10). I know for a fact I helped 100% of the people in the group, as everyone was clueless about a couple questions... but somehow 50% of the group didn't reciprocate, and kept any new-found information and corrections secret.\n\nAnd then the teacher! She failed to teach a concept that was on the project. I asked her about it, and she gave me half responses back. Sort of like me asking: \"I'm wondering how to do this ____\", and getting the response \"Well you're wrong you don't do it that way.\" Okay? And? How do I go about it? I'm getting over 80% in the course, but I spend hours having to figure things out because I have no network to ask questions. And I'm back under the wing of a teacher who doesn't have the time of day, it seems. \n\nI just don't understand the nature of people: Asking questions, respectfully, shouldn't be a problem. If they're not \"dumb questions\", and they pertain to the field you're studying in, and you're not constantly pestering, why is asking a couple questions met with quick answers that don't provide proper information. Faculty/teachers I'm running into lately are so touchy that if you even think of giving them extra work by asking things, they get moody. Students... I'm finding only maybe 1-2 students out of 30 are honest, and the rest tend to be conniving. They use each other to get ahead, and don't look for friendship, long-term networking, or the mutual benefit of the whole class/classmates. It has gotten so bad in all the classes I've gone into that I'm getting to be surprised by it.\n\nMe, I help those who need help. I'm happy to go for coffee or drinks, talk about classes, enjoy the class. I'm happy to hang out with someone who is doing poorly to help (it helps me review). I'm also happy to hang out with someone who's a bit more on top of things than me. But I get internally jaded partway through any course I take... I don't present that jaded feeling outwardly, because I know that would be self-fulfilling (if you're mad, other people see it, and then you'll be more upset because you don't know why they don't like you)... this case isn't that though! It's like, people are just touchier nowadays.\n\nI wonder if this is just luck of the draw. Like a biased sample of life experiences that I'm running into. I prided myself on how well I navigated tough work environments, and got on the good side of the \"cranky\" bosses of the world (as labelled by others). Now I seem to be falling into traps, but not by my own doing. \n\nIs this a new societal way of thinking? The whole delicate-skinned, quick-to-anger / quick-to-being-offended, type of society? It seems everyone's threat and/or nuisance radars go off when you breathe around them, as if their job description doesn't include turning their neck and you've inconvenienced them. I'm not looking to move back to the 50's, or speak as freely as Trump, but I feel like I need to re-evaluate and become faker, to survive and thrive as a young person who is near the start line... work on putting on a calculated attitude... and spend 90% of my time catering to whatever self-serving desires others want, so that they will want me to be around them, and they will want to help me out. I'm not talking about the healthy back-and-forth relationships, and healthily complimenting people -- I have friends and a girlfriend, and I'm known for being polite and friendly and professional -- I'm talking about taking my public-persona in the classroom and in similar practicum/work environments to a totally different, synthetic level; you know, be the person who people default to talking to because that person defaults to making you feel good, and never seems to talk about themself, and always seems to like you despite (on reflection) they just listen to you. I worry as I move forward that people will continue to become more and more paper-thin & self-serving... I need to get ahead with my career, and the most troublesome bumps in the road are those who have power, or are on the same path as me."

I looked up airdates and checked to make sure BBC America wasn't in any contract disputes or planning on issuing new episodes behind a paywall. When I looked at the Time Warner contact info they gave a chat option. Cool, I like chat options, I can get a record of the convo emailed to me.    \n     \nFirst the rep reboots me remotely.

So I tell him that they have an updating problem all the way around.\n\nSon of a bitch tells me he's done all he can for me. I tell him he hasn't even started doing anything for me. I ask again if he can show me empirical evidence that BBC America is holding back new episodes?    \n    \nA tech is coming out tomorrow to look at my DVR. Send klonopin."

Well he quit on Friday, came in talked to another manager and said that the industry wasn't for him.\n\nThe next day, we see a complaint online about our store. According to this woman her son walked out on us because our female training manager told him not to join the military and to get a real job. First thing to know at this point, we have three managers. One ex army one ex navy the third is married to a veteran. The only people that could've said anything were the only other two females that work with me, and neither of them had really talked to him. They also said that they wouldn't ever say anything along those lines, both have family currently serving.\n\nSo I call the lady who left the complaint, turns out to be his mother. I told her that he had come in and quit the day before, she was so pissed off. She apologized quite a few times, and said that would take the complaint down."

I'm not saying those people are totally innocent but there's certainly a lot of gaps in the original evidence apart from a coaxed confession tape that would leave reasonable doubt for the jury to not find them guilty of murder. Even if they are acquitted they're still forced into a cycle of being judged and finding it hard to get a job or do anything else in life because of that time spent in prison. "

Prior to that, I had just bought thank you cards in box sets for showers and such. In the two weeks after wedding part 1, I wrote and mailed out all of the thank you notes. After part 2, my husband and I wrote out the thank you notes together and got those out within the month. Each note was handwritten, and we had a list of phrases that we would put together (depending on the person) to write a personalized message. In total, about 3-4 sentences per card, thanking them for coming to the wedding, noting something personal from the wedding about them, and thanking for the gift and kind wishes. All in all, each card took about 5 minutes to write. Not hard. At all.\nWe went to several weddings this past spring and summer. Some for friends, and two for family members. We have received thank you notes for four of the weddings so far, and ALL of them have been prewritten. The kind where you go online, put some pictures together from the wedding, type out a message, and leave a space after Dear ______. You know, so you don't actually have to do ANY work!!\nAfter spending a shit ton of time and money on outfits, travel expenses, hotel reservations, and gifts... I hardly think a handwritten thank you note is too much to expect! Even if your wedding is MASSIVE (mine were!), just do a few a day, and eventually, they all get done. No one expects them immediately, and people are happy to wait. It's just one little thing to show your guests that you care about them and appreciate that they were with you on your wedding day!\n\nDo I have a right to be angry at these people? Am I insanely old fashioned? Did something change in wedding etiquette recently where these became ok? Or is this just my generation becoming more and more lazy?"

I've see a lot of stupid fucked up shit on the internet, but this is the first time it has ever thrown me into existential crisis. It is the most aggressively stupid thing I have ever seen. It's like watching people actively try to give themselves schizophrenia. It's largely 40 year old white dudes and attention seeking kids who have perverted a Buddhist meditation technique to justify their imaginary friends. I would be alright with that. They also believe that their imaginary friends are equally valid independent consciousnesses. OK kinda weird, but do you I guess. From there it devolves into total madness. They believe their imaginary friends can take over their bodies while they enter a \"mindscape\". They spend significant time focusing on making themselves try to hallucinate their imaginary friends. There are threads about how to best fuck your imaginary friend and because it's the fucking internet a significant number of those imaginary friends are cartoon ponies. I know what your thinking, \"this is a joke or role play. No one could really believe that.\" and that's what makes it so fucked up. Some percentage must know. It may have even started as a joke, but as with every joke about pretenting to be stupid it eventually attracted true idiots. A significant percentage are legitimately trying to do this. I wouldn't even really care about that, but it has served to help genuinely mentally ill people justify not seeking help. There are threads actively discouraging people from seeking help because you know \"Doctors just don't understand.\" Damn fucking straight they don't nor should they. It's fucking crazy. Nope. I'm fucking done. Fuck this. Do not fucking cite Socrates and Kant to try and convince me that your cartoon sex pony deserves human rights. Fuck this so much. I feel like the guy from I am legend. This is no longer my society. A new race of pony fucking zombies have taken over and it's only fair for me to off myself to give them the world. I mean it doesn't even matter. There's no way there's a god because what kind of god would let this happen? I'd like to conclude with a poem:\n\nFirst came the weebs, and I did not speak out- \n\nbecause I was not a loser \n\nThen came the transracial, and I did not speak out- \n\nbecause I was not crazy \n\nThen came the otherkin, and I did not speak out- \n\nbecause I was was an adult\n\nThen came the tulpas, and there was no one left to tell them \"Be a fucking adult. This is fucking stupid.\"\n\n\nTime to burn it all down guys. This is the end. Humans no longer deserve to live."

I took standard shipping cause I really wasnt in that big of a hurry to get the items since I intended to give them as Christmas presents towards the end of the month.  I also did it early to avoid the Christmas rush of buying presents at the last minute.  \n\nJust when I think I have almost all of my Christmas shopping done, my package arrives.  About half the order is missing.  Six items I had selected to give to my Dungeons and Dragons group for Christmas are missing.  \n\nSo I panic for a minute and then realize they have online live chat assistance.  I get on it and wait as Im #40 in line.  About 30 minutes later I get on with a live assistant.  He takes my info and comes back and tells me the items I orders, paid for, and patiently waited for over a week for are apparently out of stock or discontinued and all they could do was offer me and apology and a refund.  I totally blew my top over it.  \n\nI mean lets back up here a sec.  You're an internet company that mainly sells stuff online right?  You have X amount of stock and Y amount of orders.  Now when Y amount of orders are placed and paid for why the hell would you still offer that item?  I mean this is 20 and fucking 14 ffs.  Shouldn't stuff like that be automated? Oh the live assistant's only other excuse was \"the website is not up to date\" ***WHAT?!*** I could be alittle more understanding if say there was a note under the incomplete orders section that said hey we're out of this you should do something different.  I mean the know people are ordering Christmas presents at this time of the year but they KNOWINGLY shipped out my order with it half filled.  \n\nReally thanks thinkgeek for ruining my D&D Christmas.  Now I have to run out tomorrow to try and catch a comic book shop before they close at 7 because I cant get there before 6:20 bcs of work to try and hurriedly pick out 6 gifts for very specifically niche group of people which I have to meet with on Sunday.

I'll start out with the TL;DR, since this is long as hell.\n\n**TL;DR- I'm a chronically depressed, socially-isolated person who just realized she's a lesbian, has family issues, money issues, might have Asperger's, and is spending a holiday alone. I hate everything, I don't know how to deal with it, and I feel like I'm losing my fucking mind.**\n\nHere we fuckin' go.\n\nI have had chronic depression for fucking *YEARS*, and I've been feeling like I just can't do it anymore (not suicidal, don't worry, just mentally exhausted). I've been alone on this Thanksgiving, because I'm house-sitting for someone by myself, and that's really not helping my depression. However, being with family wouldn't be that great either. I live with my mom and younger (adult) brother, both are working a lot, and my mom is also fucking depressed, and she's basically said my brother and I are the only reason she wants to stay alive. Fun. Brother has some issues of his own, but is basically stable. We don't talk to the rest of either side of our family, for various reasons, but basically they're shitty people and have some fucked up dynamics going on. \n\nI've been having a hard time being around my mom since I realized I was a lesbian a few months ago- thought I was asexual but I realized I was just in denial, because I was scared that an experience with a creeper family member was what made me gay and that made me disgusted with myself. I no longer believe this, and I've fully accepted that I'm gay, but my mom, while accepting gay people exist and deserve rights, is still kinda homophobic. I can't tell her, because I don't have the resources to move out if she reacts badly, and I have no friends whatsoever, because I have moved many times, and am entirely socially inept. I can't drive because I need a shit-ton of driving hours, and the only person I know who can help me get hours is my mom, who is always busy. There are also only 2 cars, for my mom and my brother, so even if I magically found someone else to drive with, there is no car for me to drive in. I am going to college online while at home (because I can't drive), and get very little social interaction. Part of me likes this, but I am also oppressively lonely. Recently I think I've had more interaction with Reddit than actual people. \n\nI'm like 90% sure I have Aspergers. I don't know how to talk to people. I don't understand small talk. Half the time I don't get jokes and seem to take everything literally, and have always been made fun of for this. I sometimes laugh or smile at inappropriate times. I have a hard time reading facial expressions. I have never dated anyone, and don't understand how to flirt, but I desperately want someone to understand me. When I talk, I tend to end up talking over everyone and it becomes a one-sided conversation, and it takes a long time for me to realize the other person is uncomfortable/annoyed. I'm an adult who has broken down crying because of anxiety over giving an oral presentation in a class (before online school). I am sensitive to sounds, smells, and textures. I have a hard time processing what people say, and often have to ask them to repeat it. There's more, but you get the point. I have taken several autism spectrum/Aspergers tests months apart and they all say I'm probably high-functioning autistic or Aspergers. \n\nI want a fucking diagnosis, yes or no, so I can understand myself and move forward with my life. I'm under my mother's insurance, so she has to be involved with finding me a counselor, but she doesn't have to time or energy to do this. Also, if I tell her \"I think I might have Asperger's,\" she's going to say I'm being a hypochondriac. She doesn't take me seriously, because I often obsess over things (happens to be another sign of Aspergers's). I'm also worried about finding a therapist that accepts LGBT people without my mom finding out I'm gay, which might be hard, since I have to go there with her because it's her insurance, and she's probably the only person that could drive me. \n\nEven if I didn't have social problems and a lack of transportation, I wouldn't be able to go out and meet people because we have money problems. The area we live in has rent that is way too fucking high, we can only afford a small 2 bedroom apartment (my mom sleeps on the couch). We nearly miss rent or have to pay late EVERY SINGLE MOTHERFUCKING MONTH. My mom is a teacher, but her salary is not enough for a motherfucking 2 bedroom apartment. She got a different teaching job this year, but entered a new tax bracket, so she barely gets any of the salary increase. Even with my brother having a full-time job, and me getting some money part time, we still have problems. My brother and I have been paying for like half the rent, and I have been paying for all the food. My brother and I want to move out, but we never have money to save, because my mom says she needs money for rent or bills. I have been having to pay part of the bills since highschool, when she started \"borrowing\" money from me and not telling me until she'd already used it for bills. She keeps telling us how guilty she feels, and how she's going to pay us back. Every month she thinks she'll be able to give me something back, but something always happens, and it's just not possible. We have to pay bills, I get that, but I wish she would just stop fucking lying that she's going to pay me back. She knows she fucking can't. \n\nOn top of all this, I'm full time in the online school, and struggling to find the motivation and focus to do my work. My grades are A's and B's, which is good, but I'm just barely getting my assignments in on time (literally 11:59PM the day it's due), and I feel totally mentally drained (especially since they're all condensed classes).\n\nI don't want to kill myself, but I've been feeling like I just can't deal with life anymore. It's too much, and not enough. I have all this shit going on, but almost every day I do nothing but wake up in an empty house (mom and brother at work/school), and do online work all alone the whole day then maybe cook for everyone. They both come home at different times, and my brother wants to joke around and be an asshole, and my mom gets home and rants work. I don't know how much longer I can do this, and I don't know how to get out. I feel like I'm losing my mind, and I wish I had some help. I have an allergic reaction when I cry, so I'm going to be sneezing all night an tomorrow. FUCK.\n\nIf you read this whole fucking thing, thank you, and I hope your day was better than mine. I know shit could be worse off for me, but I just needed a space to let all this shit out. Have a good day/evening/night."

About a year ago, I was on my way to the nearest trolley station late at night, and I was assaulted by 2 white guys in Santee, CA (most people around here refer to that area Klantee for obvious reasons). They broke my arm, gave me a serious concussion and cut me up pretty bad before knocking me out and stealing my backpack full of expensive school supplies and my prescription of Percocet (I take these for chronic pain after being the victim of a hit and run while I was crossing a crosswalk almost 5 years ago that left me permanently paralyzed from the right knee down, so I can't run.) When I come to, I'm in the back of a police cruiser. The guys who assaulted me called the cops and claimed the assailants were only doing a citizen's arrest on me for supposedly vandalizing their car and attacking them with a stick. Despite the guys not having a scratch on them while I'm all bloody, covered in gashes all over my body, and have a black eye, the cops believed them and accused me of being under the influence of crystal meth (despite never even touching the stuff in my life) and charged me with vandalism after the officers casually debate on what to charge me with. One of the officers even sneered and said that i don't need to go to a hospital after I ask them to get me a paramedic. Another officer threatened to charge me with public intoxication if I refused to stand up properly as he took pictures of what he referred to as minor scrapes. When I went to court, the judge was unwilling to dismiss the case because the police wrote that I was drunk and high of meth and that they had received numerous calls of someone matching my description supposedly throwing rocks at parked cars in their report. And here's the kicker: The DA was unwilling to press charges against the guys who assaulted me and I was forced to ***pay $350*** for a small scratch on the attackers' car that I allegedly made while \"attacking them\". Out of all of my property that was stolen, I was given back a now broken iPhone and my (**also now broken**) prescription eyeglasses covered in dirt and blood. Not only that, the hospital I was taken to hours after the assault continues to try and charge me $12,000 for the ambulance and emergency room visit because Medi-Cal refusing to cover the hospital visit because I supposedly have some private insurance called United Healthcare (which has no record of me ever having any coverage with them.)"

It's as simple that.\n\nI just had an argument with my father and now I can't stop shaking. The afternoon started off pretty well. I was doing some homework then my dad asked for the date of some events and I went off to look for those things. When I called out the dates for him, he misheard, so I raised my voice a little. Mind you, I was in the basement, so it was a little hard to hear me.\n\nThis however just sets off my father. He comes storming down to my room with a frying pan in his hand. He starts ranting about how I'm always yelling at him and I can never keep my voice down.\n\nI told him I just raised my voice so he could hear better. He just ignores this though. The fucker starts to call me the dirtiest shit in Vietnamse you wouldn't even call your worst enemy. I mean, some of that shit actually hurt. During the rant, he's waving the metal frying pan around and moves towards me as if to break it on my face.\n\nDuring all this, my rage just keeps building and building and building. In my head, all I could think of is how I would just rip his throat out if he ever hit my with the pan. Before this I was trying to reason with him, but then I began to yell. \n\nIt all began to fall apart there, he swung the pan and I just grab it and smash it against the wall. At this point we've both lost control. I just slam his face with my hands and stalk away. This was the first time I've ever hit my dad back and it felt so good.\n\nThis sort of thing has happened before, but I've never hit him in any of those altercations. The thing that scares me though, is that it felts so good to just hit him back for once. Right when I was beginning to type this, I was still wanting to go back out and stick the fucker with a knife a couple times. \n\nI know I have depression. That may have something to do with it but this is just wrong. I know I mentioned that I don't really like my parents, but I never wanted to hit anyone like that before. \n\nSo what the fuck is my malfunction, reddit?\n\n*Sorry for the long read.*"

I worked my ass off in my career to better myself so I could provide for my family.\nI gave you three beautiful children and I am a great father. \nI was there for you when you were sick. \nYou say I wasn\u2019t there for you when your dad died but you are so fucked up you could\u2019t see it. \nEven with all the shit you gave me I still provided. All I ever asked for was some sex. Yet your pussy dried up for the one person who cared for you like NO other. \n\nThink about it. You have NOBODY to count on. Jen? Jessica? It\u2019s a joke. Yet the one person who would have done ANYTHING for you, well you shit on him.

Although I love the fact he tuned out to be nothing more than a horny douchebag. You got USED. How does it feel? Get uses to it because you are going to be used like a whore.\n\nThink about this. Out of all the men I have known I was probably the least likely to do anything outside my marriage even with our differences and troubles. Yet you brought this upon me. All I needed was some affection, support and sex. You couldn\u2019t manage that. \n\nYou say you tried but it was always a half hearted effort. A gesture made in passing. I knew it was not genuine\n\nLove how you rip on your cousin yet take advice from her. Nice.\n\nOh getting advice from your mother, who recommends an attorney by your uncle\u2026.who is a low life scum. Would expect no less from your mother. \n\nLove how your so open to using a vibrator with Dan but with me it was pulling teeth. What like 10 fucking years? maybe you should give me some credit. I taught you to masturbate which you couldn\u2019t even learn yourself. \n\nOh and the guy begging for sex\u2026.HOW in the world could you give yourself to such scum. Exactly why it hurts. I deserved what that guy got. Guy was literally begging to fuck you again. pathetic Good luck figuring out a mans character before you fuck him. \n\nOh and the pictures you sent Dan\u2026.where was mine. Begged for years.\n\nCar sex\u2026another. Begged for years yet you spread them wide for a nobody in the car. Nice. Shows your class.\n\nOh and this is the killer. Falling in love with Dan? You didn\u2019t learn your lesson the first time. I was very guarded with Jill and jaded. I knew how I felt and I knew I could walk away. Perhaps I did like her but I promised myself I would never let myself feel like that again. Apparently you don\u2019t learn. \n\nI broke up with her because I was hoping for the right thing. You would dump Dan and try. However I was not going to beg. I through out hints but of course you couldn\u2019t let go. \n\nVery nice. While I get therapy and was trying to talk to you, little did I know you couldn\u2019t talk because of the guilt you had for fucking tony behind my back. I made an effort to remove myself away from them and be a family again only to be stabbed in the back.\n\nHA love the fact that he dumped you or whatever and you came back to me begging. I impressed myself that I did not give in to being your backup plan. \n\nOh and you think I will be alone for the rest of my life. One I doubt it. Two I honestly don\u2019t mind. After going through this hell I welcome being alone. \n\nGreat being a guy. I don\u2019t ever have to worry about being used. I want to be used. Perhaps you should have used me more during our marriage and this would not have happened. \n\nYou attracted a stalker and I defended you. Apparently that was worth nothing. Didn\u2019t it tell you something? No because you are too blind to see it. \n\nGod, amazing, when faced with a life of possibly being alone, never finding a guy\u2026you shit on the ONE who would have done anything for you. Truly amazing. \n\nFUCK YOU"

You ignored me at my lowest, fostered weakness and codependency. You kept me low, unable to act for myself. You ignored my cries for help.\n\nAll the while I had to sneak around the land mines so the fires didn\u2019t burn any higher.\n\nBombshells littered the hall leading to my bedroom, ashes settled in the kitchen.\n\nI was afraid to go to school, yet afraid to come home. Nobody understood me. Just hide, Son, no one gets it. Just disengage, Son, it might get better. Just sacrifice your own joy and survive, Son, until you can get away.\n\nYou say there was good in your dynamic, that I didn\u2019t see.\n\nTell me, then, how for 20 years of my life I only opened my eyes to more trauma, more pain, and more dysfunction? How could you say I am the one without eyes to see, when you didn\u2019t see my depression and self-loathing sitting under your nose for four years?\n\nI don\u2019t even want to ask for you help because I don\u2019t want to hear the excuses that you give when I tell you it\u2019s YOUR dysfunction that caused mine.\n\nIt\u2019s your lack of sense that\u2019s destroying me. It\u2019s your arguing and calamities that caused my anxiety. It\u2019s you both who taught me that love was stupid, relationships were shit, and that EVERYBODY is out to get me. It\u2019s you both who taught me not to trust people.\n\nI should\u2019ve seen it coming. I should\u2019ve seen it a long time ago. But no, this is NOT MY FAULT.\n\nIt is yours. It is entirely, 100%, completely, and utterly your wrong doing. The two of you, my parents, those who are supposed to be my greatest comfort, have been the greatest source of pain, infuriation, sadness, and brokenness in my life.\n\nYou emotionally abandoned me. I was left to fend for myself, to build brick walls so high I couldn\u2019t climb out of them, and no one could break them down. You left me to the wolves, and egged them on with your actions, leaving me to shiver in the cold winter.\n\nI don\u2019t want to shout or blame because I know you \u201cdid your best\u201d and \u201cgiven your circumstances it seemed right\u201d and that \u201cI\u2019m too young to understand\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s not the worst parenting job\u201d, but you still have both murdered the child I once was.\n\nThat child you both speak highly of\u2026 HIs blood is on your hands. His confidence is in the dirt because you both destroyed his self worth, his comfort, his security, and ignored his emotional needs.\n\nYou didn\u2019t value his input, or listen to his problems. The second he\u2019d start venting, you\u2019d shut him up to \u201csolve\u201d them. Which makes them seem solvable and me seem stupid, incapable, and small. Thanks for that extra dagger.\n\nYou fucking wrecked me. I have abandonment issues. I can\u2019t even approach women because I feel like a twelve year old child inside, because THATS ALL YOU EVER LET ME BE.\n\nThanks for nothing. You\u2019re both scum. I fucking regret ever loving you. You should have given me up for adoption to a family who could actually handle raising a child. I was RAISED BY CHILDREN. YOU ARE BOTH FUCKING INFANTS ON THE EMOTIONAL SCALE AND I HATE THAT I HAD TO DEAL WITH YOUR SHIT.\n\nLiterally, the worst part of my life was living with you two. I hated every moment of it. And thankfully, I have learned to hate myself, and my life. I am depressed, anxious, self-doubting, self-deprecating, and it\u2019s all owed to you and your wonderful effort as parents.\n\nSo thanks, and please don\u2019t try again. Ever. Fucking failures.\n\nYou failed. At the most important thing you\u2019ll ever do in your life. You fucking failed miserably. You absolutely obliterated it.\n\nYou forced me away every 2 years because YOU TWO couldn\u2019t face your problems. You effectively ignored me because YOU TWO couldn\u2019t see past your own issues with yourselves and each other.\n\nI have so much anger towards you. I can\u2019t even fathom it. I can\u2019t even fathom how deep it goes.\n\nLike you taught me, to save the world from it, I shut it in. I go numb. I fucking black out and miss portions of my life BECAUSE ITS WHAT YOU BOTH TAUGHT ME.\n\nSO THANKS FOR THAT. Thanks for a hand basket of emotional issues that I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life working to fix.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that you aren\u2019t total fuck ups. You had your shit \u201cput together\u201d. You love me. You have good priorities. But you two were so caught up in your pride, your stress, your situations, and your anger with each other that you missed the WHOLE FUCKING POINT of being a parent\u2026 Raising me. Making memories. Teaching me things. Laughing with me. Crying with me. Smiling at me. Letting me learn from dumb mistakes.\n\nYou, who claimed to be for my happiness, effectively aren\u2019t.\n\nMom, you are chasing an image of perfection that will only ever exist in your head. It\u2019s fucking nuts. You are NEVER satisfied with anything anyone does. You\u2019re so afraid to face yourself and the fears of not having met expectations, so you keep upgrading the image! You keep changing it!\n\nThat\u2019s why we move every 2 years. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve had a thousand hobbies, and we do all this crazy shit. To appease your insatiable image-cultivation! It will NEVER bring you happiness! It\u2019s ruining your fucking life!\n\nDad, you\u2019re a lunatic! You\u2019re working hard to support something she\u2019ll never be content with. You\u2019re killing yourself and her and me trying to appease this.\n\nAnd in the back of the room is me. Sitting alone playing xbox. That was my high school career. Running from your dysfunction because you two literally missed the best years of my life. And because of your actions, I mostly did too. So thanks for that too\u2026\n\nI will never be like you. I will kick and scream and fight and yell to change. I will heal from this. I will deal with my issues, unlike you. And I will be better. So fuck you guys. I love you, but fuck you, you hurt me. You\u2019re bad for me. I\u2019ll be damned if you could realize it and begin to change at all.\n\nSeriously. After I graduate college, that might be the last picture you get with me for a while. Once you pay that last bill and I\u2019m out on my own officially, no strings attached, expect a period of silence. Expect the cold shoulder. Because I need to separate myself from the toxic tyranny that is YOU TWO in my life.\n\nTogether or separate. You both have created a living hell for me. Thanks.\n\nSigned,\nYour Beloved Son Whom You Emotionally Abandoned."

I know that technically I inadvertently broke a rule with them, but the heavy handed response is fucking bullshit.\n\nSo, Nine Inch Nails and Queens Of The Stone Age are touring Australia next year. Huge deal for me, NIN are a bucket list band for me. \n\nAnyway, there was three windows in which to purchases tickets -\nThe presale for members of the NIN and QOTSA fan clubs (merely a matter of having signed up for free to their website) was a week after the announcement. A week after that presale was the second presale for Frontier Touring members (the promoter - again a matter of being signed up to a free mailing list), with the general public sale opening the next day. \n\nThe fan club presale was limited to 2 tix per person. Easy. I'd promised my brother I'd take him so my NIN fan club membership gets that sorted.\n\nNow, a work mate wanted to get one (he was a member of the QOTSA fan club). He is stuck on a long call, so I go through the QOTSA site on his login and go to the presale.\n\nBoth presales are done through Ticketek. More accurately, it's a single presale.\n\nI go through the motions, get to credit card entry. He's on the phone, so I use mine, figure I will get cash off him later.\n\nStupid fucking mistake.\n\nI guess it flagged as 3x tix purchased on one credit card. What do they do? Cancel all fucking three immediately. No refunds. No communication. \n\nThey would've known they were cancelling the fucking things before they even finished charging my card, yet they still took the full ~$400.\n\nI email them (their fucking phone number is always engaged), and wait two days just to get an unclear cookie cutter response about terms and policies stating no refunds.\n\nThey didn't address my actual question of HAVE YOU CANCELLED MY TICKETS?! My only indication this is the case is that they have disappeared from the transaction history on my Ticketek Members page.\n\nWhich brings me to my other concern.\nI also purchase Fleetwood Mac tix for next month and Jimmy Carr tix for January. The FM tix are still showing, but the JC to which I bought about a month later are not. As far as I can figure, there is no reason as to why they would be cancelled, yet now I'm fucking worried. They won't tell me. They won't refund me. I can't get a straight answer. \n\nAs I said, I know I fucked up by using one credit card for two purchases, but an immediate cancellation without refund is fucking bullshit.\n\nFuck Ticketek.

Just because your dumb ass in your revved up replacement for an adequately sized penis happens to be in a hurry does not mean that i am somehow magically not going fast enough when the posted speed limit is clearly being exceeded by 10 fucking miles per hour!\n\nFirst, you tailgated me. Not just tailgated me, you got so close i could practically see your nose hairs. But there was no traffic next to me and i wasn't going to slow down OR speed up, and still you stayed there for 10 minutes, up my ass so far i could smell you BO, honking your damn horn. When you finally did get over, you only missed my bumper by inches. OK, whatever. Your just a dick, fine. I can deal with that. You then cut me off, again getting so close it really is amazing we didn't trade paint. Again, whatever, fuck you. I didn't react, because why bother? another asshole on the rode that for some reason doesn't want to acknowledge the speed limit, whatever. A dime a dozen. See, im a fairly safe driver. I don't speed all that much, and i tend to pick a speed and stick with it. If i am late for something, that is my damned fault and i will deal with it, but, you know, as a responsible adult, i tend to plan enough time to get where im going while only going a little over the posted speed limit. You know, kind of like your supposed to, which is why the god damned speed limit is posted in the first place. So i get it all the time. I will be driving 5 or 10 over in the right lane, because, you know, faster than the posted speed limit and some of the other cars around and what not, and some ass wants to flash his brights or honk that i am going too slow. I mostly turn the other cheek, let them pass and go back to my regular speed and what not. But no, you would have none of that. Your sense of inferiority led to you doing the most dangerous and stupid thing i have ever seen anyone do on a highway to date. After cutting me off while i was already going 75, you slam on your brakes to come to a complete stop mere feet from my front bumper. You are damn lucky i have good reflexes and really good brakes, because i was able to stop only inches from your bumper. You then proceeded to gesture wildly to me and my car for a solid minute, dead stopped, in what was quickly becoming a busy road. I mean, seriously, WHAT THE FUCK????????!???\n\nI get it. You have issues. You are late, you are on steroids, mommy never breastfed you, whatever. Something led to you feeling small and impotent, so you feel you need to be a dick and boss people around to make yourself feel better, but come on. This was simply stupid and extremely dangerous, not only to me, but to everyone else on the road including yourself, just to prove that you were bigger than me about something that you were clearly int he wrong about in the first place. I mean, if you want to drive fast, more power to you, but don't be a fucking asshole about it, dickhead!\n\nI mean, seriously, i was fucking going 75 in a 65!"

College was hard to say the least, everything was new and different. Though in time I got used to it and everything was fine until my parents, once again ruined it. I wanted to switch majors but they wouldn't have it, and I got stuck in this shitty major I hated. Of course I did badly and consequently they started blaming that on me. I quit college with a massive debt, which , of course, they never stopped mentioning. I was back in my shitty town, with my shitty parents, and now I owed what was 20,000 dollars The pressure was too much but I kept bouncing from job, to job, until I couldn't do it anymore. After three years I had had enough. I took two weeks to do some soul searching, only to end up physically fighting with my fucking dad, who then instead of listening kicked me out of the house. I lived on the streets for about four days, during which I didn't sleep more than 4 hours the whole time. I started hallucinating, and hearing voices, when I came back to their house I was a fucking wreck, but of course life had to get shittier. I don't rememeber how it happened but they commmited me, and subsequently I was drugged. I was then forced to take antipsychotics, and labeled schizophrenic.All of this would have been fine, I could have overcome this, but the drugs, the antipsuychotics they gave me, have left me on par with a potato.  Ever since I got out, normal tasks that were so easy before are near impossible now, I can barely hold my concentration for long, even basic reading and spelling are a challenge. I'm done with life, I don't know when i'll do it but I intend to kill myself. Ugh anyways thanks for reading this. I hope your lives are much better than mine ever was. "

You, bitch-tastic housemate that I should have trusted my better instincts about moving in with and the sage advice of never living with a friend, are not the only fucking person who lives in the house. I just 'suit myself sometimes?' You spent $600 on a lame-ass generic table and chairs from Ikea because you liked it and watch us like hawks when we use it in case we fuck up your precious fucking table. But do I complain? No. I use your stupid fucking heat mats and bought a vinyl table cloth to protect it from spills. Your boyfriend comes to stay for the week--who I actually prefer about a bajillion times more than you right now anyway--and you mention it the day before with a 'if that's okay' attached and yet you get weird when I'm going to have a dozen people over for my birthday. And on that note, you went to a 'massive effort'  for my birthday? You split the cost of--a very tasty and fancy, I'll admit--cake with our other housemate. That's it. Oh, I guess you could say you 'allowed' me to have friends over before we went out. But I pay for a third of the rent for this house you self-important whiny asshole and it was my birthday. And I cleaned the house and bought the food and sangria you were all too happy to enjoy and cleaned up when I came home so that you wouldn't wake up to a messy kitchen. And I bought plastic cups because you'd prefer if I didn't use your glasses even though most of the glasses are mine anyway. And at the bar you sat with your group of friends and when I came over to say hi and spend some time with them all you did was keep steering the conversation to medicine and the hospital and omg we're learning how to save lives and what I'm doing is so much more important than what you're doing and oh you're tired after your first week back to what is going to be your hardest year well I had to be at the hospital at 7:30am to talk to some dying woman and blah blah blah. Fuck you. And I paid for my own birthday dinner that I didn't even enjoy but I chose a restaurant where you would have a lot of options you vegan vegetable fucker and congratulations, you put the cake plates in the dishwasher and wiped off the counter in the morning because I didn't clean up after my own fucking slice of birthday cake.\n\nBy the way bitch, I found out my grandmother died today and I can't go to the funeral because 1. I can't afford the flight and 2. even if I could, it's on the other side of the fucking world and I would get there after it was over. So instead of being able to give my dad a hug, I'm writing an angry rant on reddit because it's 4am and I can't sleep. \n\nBecause you got pissed off I bought a lamp at Ikea and chose a text instead of, I don't know, waiting to talk to me and hear that I went ahead bought it because I liked it and figured if we didn't use it in the living room, I could use it my room. You kept saying you want to make sure house stuff didn't get in the way of our friendship? Well that ship has fucking sailed with you riding on the front like a wooden mermaid on a pirate ship with her tits out."

They just don't work.\n\nSo I sometimes need to use Windows, so I planned to install it on to one of my other hard drives so I could use mods. But for some dumbass reason, you can't create a windows installation USB on Linux, so I go to ask my brother if I can use his laptop, and he just looks at me, revolted, and yells,\n\n#\"NO! Why would I let you use it? You destroy every computer you touch!\"\n\nI think he might be referring to when I tried to pirate Undertale and royally fucked up my windows installation and had to reinstall, but he apparently takes that like I'll destroy his too. He also doesn't care that I have to use Skype to talk to one of my best friends, but the linux version of skype works terribly so half the time I can't call her. He also constantly berates me for using linux, saying that it's a terrible OS that nothing works on and that I should switch back to Windows. But when I *actually try to switch back to windows*, he doesn't give a shit and won't let me. Honestly, I feel like he just doesn't care about me and just pays attention to me when he asks me to go hang out in his room and watch him play video games. Not play with him, just watch. That's like the only time he's nice to me.\n\nHe's also even let me do this before, and *surprisingly*, his computer is still in peak condition. I've even helped him get rid of viruses and defrag his hard drive, but he doesn't care about that, I'm obviously just terrible with computers, right?\n\nSo, I go to ask my sister because she has a laptop too, and she just says no because she just doesn't want to. No reason, she just doesn't want to. It makes so much sense, because *obviously*, it takes so much work to enter her password into her laptop and hand it to me. It's so difficult,\n\nAnd yeah, I get it. ***I know that it's their property and they have the right to keep me from using it.*** That's not what I'm mad about. What I'm mad about is that they have such bullshit reasons to not let me. My brother doesn't give a shit about anything I say to him and neither of them listen to reason at all.

We try too hard to appeal to customers in ways imaginable and we're one of the companies where despite how bad of a customer you are - we have to treat you like you're above us.\n\nWe don't have a union, so that means that this company can walk all over you and you have to abide by the stupid rules in place. Don't want to? Find another job, basically.\n\nI proceeded to get professionally blasted by the manager over my review. How I don't talk to the customers, how I don't meet the ever fluctuating stock count, how I don't follow company practice when stocking shelves and following planagrams. All of so much bullshit I had to hear from this fucker, going on how he always keeps referring to any lecture or criticism as to the whole team and not just me. Before making a U-Turn and putting it on me in a sophisticated manner as if I'm too dumb to put it together in which I did.\n\nFirst off and foremost, I'm one being. I'm one worker. I've worked in several big retail chains under my belt. Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Dollar General .etc are a few. Retail companies have the same shit system, no matter where you go, it's only the different kind of people you put up with that still enforce it. Every retail company has stupid practices and they're very unappreciated no matter what you fucking do for them.\n\nSuch is the case of this review. Because that everyone is everywhere, they don't see me talking to people. Because that the rules change and the stock number changes at a whim. They don't see me *trying* to meet it. Because that they decide to fuck with my schedule. Doesn't mean I don't try to be there.\n\nAnd this is a common thing with retail industries. You try your damn best, you get told to try your best by these same fucking people. You get advice, you play by the rules and you stuck to the rhythm. But it's just simply never enough for these assholes.\n\nThe whole existence of Retail is to get money. Yeah, I know that technically it's about trading and moving a shitty economy around to give money \"purpose\". But really, it's all about making money.\n\nBreaking your back to make ridiculous ends meet, getting headaches because of how imbalanced and fluctuating everything around you is. Putting up with piss poor attitudes from co-workers to customers and people neglecting your fucking efforts. All of this bullshit for petty pay and yet we're expected to do it all with a smile on our face?\n\nWell, I don't have a smile on my face with this shit. I don't see how you can expect me to be at my best while throwing curve ball after curve ball at me. While every piece of advice you tell me will be irrelevant the next time I come your shitty store.\n\nMaybe it's YOU and how you maintain things, Manager. I've kept score on my progress and if I had to give myself a review, it'd be fair and a little above average. And don't give me this bullshit \" oh, the computer decides and evaluates your progress\" NO IT DOESN'T! IT'S YOU! ALLL YOU!!"

I hung up on him and explained to my manager what had happened and just felt so insulted.\n\nThe very next call I take, the guy immediately asks where I'm from. I told him I'm at the corporate headquarters in Boston. He then asks if I'm American and I told him no I'm not originally American. He asked where I'm from and I told him I'm not allowed to give out my personal information. He then said,\n\n\"Well if you're not American, what the fuck are you doing here!?\"\n\nI hung up on him immediately and at this point I'm in tears because of all the other stuff happening with Trumps orders and not being able to visit my family even though I am in my fourth year of having a green card, or have them visit me. Then, after having to explain to my manager why I hung up on another caller, my supervisor listened to the calls, and came to me crying and apologizing for what had happened.\n\nIs America really like this? \n\nI came here for freedom, but I did not expect this. \n\nI used my life savings, and money inherited from my too-soon-deceased father to emigrate from Iran to Boston. It was costly and they call it winning the green card lottery. \n\nI was arrested several times in Iran for wearing my hijab too loosely (showing too much hair / headscarf too far back) and also once for kissing my then boyfriend in public (arrested for not being married). My family thought it would be best for me to go to the US, and I too sought the freedom I thought it promised.  \n\nI am disgusted. Those men on the phones earlier did not even know I was Iranian, and I fear what they might have said if they did know. \n\nHow can they treat other Americans with such disrespect? Don't the callers know this land belonged to natives before them, and they (the callers) and their ancestors are immigrants to this land?\n\n\nI am Mahdi and I am studying for my MBA at UMASS Boston.

That's a huge swath of her disability now gone. It's still enough however to cover rent\n\nDad works. Barely. And keeps dragging his feet on finding an actual job. I won't go into detail on what he does, but works two part time jobs that are mostly on call. There are applications littering the place that are only half way filled out. \n\nMeanwhile I was spending 8+ hours a day for three years, taking what ever seasonal or part time job I could, trying to find an actual job only to be called a \"free loading piece of shit.\" \n\nWhat I don't understand is how he will go to the store, buy a carton of eggs, a loaf of bread, a gallon of milk, some cereal, and like a block of cheese and it's $80. Yet his car is almost completely out of gas, still. \n\nThat's another thing. I drive his truck which is $110 to fill the tank and sometimes he needs for work... but will only put $10-20 in it. That's barely a quarter of a tank and doesn't nearly cover the driving he does for a single nights work. \n\nGranted he *had* to put a full tank in it last week... I'm stuck having to put gas in both cars atop of rent. The truck I drive I don't mind... but my dad coming up to me to say his car is out of gas gets old, really fucking fast.  \n\nWell now the cars need gas, to be inspected, and registration is coming up... guess who the only one with money is, despite being told not to worry about it? \n\nSo now I get to call the dealership, again, and put my appointment on hold because I dunno when I will have money again. \n\nI want to move out.

            "value": "Ok so I love twitter and ig and even fb because after erasing my old accounts and creating new ones and selectively following/adding people and pages that I actually care about. My issue is how social media creates this false personality of you. It can make someone that is extremely uninteresting and dull in real life seem exciting and fun and cool. For example, I knew a girl, let's call her Nancy, she would snapchat every minute of her life and literally control the narrative by posting things that weren't true. One time my friends and I were drinking and her and her roommate got dressed up and came over. One, they didn't drink, Nancy just took the bottle and snapped pictures of the bottle and her holding the bottle to make people think she was drinking. Two, she literally got herself and her roommate dressed up to take pictures for Instagram. You know, i don't care if you're not cool with drinking or smoking because that's not your thing but straight up lying about it for some views and likes is straight up wack. She would be the type of person to ask you to redo something funny you did so she can snapchat it. If you hung out with this girl in real life she was an airhead, she couldn't talk about anything substantial or interesting. It would be all about snapchat or Instagram, when the right time to post a picture for optimal likes would be, debating whether or not a certain picture should be posted. Snap chatting every moment of her and our lives even when we told her not to. This is the bubbly baby of the group so no one was willing to be the asshole to kill her shit. Oh one more detail, this girl was a year older than us. The craziest thing is that this caricature of herself that she displayed on social media actually got so much attention and so many likes. To the point that the friend who I mentioned earlier in the story about dressing up for ig likes actually pursued Nancy and became close to her just to get the attention she was getting. \n\nThis is what brings me to my next point, people doing things JUST for the likes or RTs or favorites. That burns my soul, it takes the fun and legitimacy out of everything. I hate when people (guys and girls) post an irrelevant quote with a picture of themselves, I don't care if you want to be a narcissist and post a bunch of pictures of yourself for likes, more power to you. The caption is what bothers me because it's like you're trying to justify being attention hungry which is dumb. If you want people to thirst for you and how attractive you are be my guest, but don't try to turn it into something it isnt. My other issue is that people will say or post certain things just for the sake of the reaction they'll get or just to desperately relate to some simpletons that RT the same things over and over. \"'My life is so sad\" \"semester has me like *crying* pic\" \"talking about being a broke and stressed college student\" I never understood why people have to post about how much work they do and then write another post about how they're tweeting/snapping/posting instead of doing said work. WHY, it's not like your followers are going to magically tweet you  the answer or tweet you a thesis statement. GET OFF THE INTERNET. You're a busy college student? Congrats so are the other 30,000k people going to your state college. I even knew someone who was a bit older like mid 20s posting about how hectic their life was with their 2 jobs and post grad and applying for some competition, like wow are you just learning that life requires work? I'm glad you had enough time in your uber busy life to post about how busy you are and then share the post across multiple outlets.\nSocial media is useful af and I realized getting off is hard because you immediately notice the disconnect from everything that's going on. I was off FB/T/IG/SC for like 3 months and it was hard to keep up with new albums coming out, new movie trailers, or even current events (I'm not much of a newspaper person) without being on social media. I just hate that stupid shit that comes with it if that makes sense. "

I'm relieved as hell, but here's the thing: I KNOW that I'm going to graduate as an honor student, I KNOW that I did what I had to. And I'm fucking over it. I'm done stressing, I just put down my books and said, \"fuck it, my life is more than impressing others\". So I haven't been going to school much, I mean what does it matter? I can honestly say that this is the happiest that I've ever been in years! I am genuinely happy and stress free.\n\nNow, after my attendance started dropping, people finally come to me worried. But they don't even ask how I'm feeling, they just come to lecture me on how disappointing it is. WHAT? I'm still the same, I'm still getting A's in classes, I'm still passing my tests, who the fuck are you to care? In fact, I still show up to class more than most of my shitty school does, why are you picking on me specifically? That's right, because of expectations.\n\nThe better you do, the higher expectations get for you. Doing good in school is no longer impressive, and it becomes a standard. I don't even know where I'm going with it, but I'm happy for once and I'm never letting anyone take that away from me ever again. Fuck you all."

Before you disagree, just look, look how quickly this attack will be forgotten. Look at how many minutes of silences that will be held for them around the world, in fact, not a single one will be held anywhere. Look at how many celebrities that will tweet out their thoughts and prayers and concern for them. No Turkish flags anywhere; in the Paris attacks there were French flags everywhere, even on Facebook profile pictures. In the Orlando shooting there were pride flags everywhere. I haven't seen a single Turkish flag anywhere. It just pisses me off, aren't they fucking humans, don't they eat, sleep, and have families like fucking everyone else. But because it's in Turkey, which is a Muslim country, their lives seems to be less fucking significant. In fact, Muslims are the biggest victims of terrorist attacks, just look at [this](http://) list of terrorist attacks and see where most of them happen, in fucking muslim countries. Yes, corrupt Muslims carried out the attacks in both Paris and Orlando, but that doesn't mean that if normal Muslims are attacked and killed, that you should mourn less, humans are humans, the people that died in Paris are no different from the ones that died in Turkey yesterday. Humans are fucking humans.\n"

He has locked my keys in my car numerous times and I've had to go bail him out, and has even managed to lose my fuel cap for my car.\n\nSo tonight, we went to the movies, and on the way there, my friend was in the back of my car rolling a spliff. Now of course, like I always tell him and my brother, I said \"Hey guys make sure there's no pot or zig zags or lighters left back there when you get out\" They both agree. Well, half way through the movie, my friend goes out for a smoke, and doesn't come back for a good 45 minutes. I begin to get concerned, and go out looking for him. The movie ends, and I still can't find him. After 2 hours of searching for him with my brother, he tweets me saying \"I got locked out of the theatre and took a cab home.\" Okay, no big deal, I'm glad he's safe.\n\nNow, here's where my trail of rage starts:\n\nI've made a habit of having look through my car after my friend has been in it, and 98% of the time, he leaves his stuff in my car, anything from pot to zig zags, to his wallet and phone. I look in the back seat, and find a pack of zig zags and pieces of paper he was using for filter, and his box cutter from work. I immediately fucking snapped. I said to my brother \"How fucking irresponsible is this guy? He left all this shit back here\" I tossed the zig zags box cutter in the garbage, and then my brother said something that sent me right off the fucking edge \"Just relax, man, why are you making such a big deal out of it?\"\n\nWhen i confront my friend about finding his stuff, he usually gives me a similar response.\n\nFUCK YOU BOTH! HOW FUCKING HARD IS IT TO MAKE SURE YOU DONT LOSE SOMETHING EVERY FUCKING TIME YOU GO SOMEWHERE? I HAVE TWO STUPID STONERS, ONE WHO LOSES HIS PHONE, AND ONE WHO CAN'T SEEM TO STOP LOCKING HIS KEYS IN MY CAR, TELLING ME TO *RELAX*? EVEN AFTER HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES I'VE TOLD YOU TO NOT LEAVE SHIT IN MY CAR? You have no idea how much stuff of my friends i have thrown out in the trash.\n\n\nEDIT: I also wanna say, I'm not a fucking saint either, I drink a lot, and am fucked up too, but I don't cause others inconvenience because of my antics."

A 6 year old introvert and a 15 year old daughter with epilepsy. You didn't even TRY to get anyone out here. You TRIED Saturday, once I went over there AGAIN to check again what was the hold up. Now, keep in mind, we live in Houston Texas. Temps here are  pretty much HOT or EXTREMELY HOT. But did you care? NO. You went home and enjoyed your weekend. Probably in your air conditioned home. Meanwhile, I have to take my kids baths twice a day so they can even be in here. Sunday you said they would come Monday morning. This to me was music to my ears! Finally some relief. Monday morning got here and nobody came. 9....10...11...and nothing..finally at 12 I call you and you act surprised, as if you didn't know he hadn't showed up yet. Finally at 1:30 someone shows up. I was very happy to see the a/c man! My happiness was short lived as he comes in here and says EVERYTHING is running good. WOW! Then why are you sweating? My A/C was set at 70 and he was standing there sweating. \n\nBut oh dear Jessica, do you even care? No, you don't... you could probably care more about a chewed up piece of gum than your tenants. Why should you care? We only pay our rent on time and we're good tenants. Never had any problems. Why should you care to keep us happy? Nah! You said once if we wanted we could leave, that gave me the understanding that you would rather lose GOOD tenants than fix what needs fixing. I am a single mom, I know you know this and that is why you threw that suggestion out there. You know I cannot leave. And to add to it you said you would keep my deposit. I don't see why though. You are the one letting me out of my contract, my deposit was for any damages left behind when we moved out. But anyway. You as a landlord, property manager, but more importanly human being, should be a little more concerned about your residents. We're hot. We work hard for our money only to pay a 350 dollar light bill because my A/C in on ALL the time because it is not cooling properly. My children are miserable! I am miserable seeing my kids miserable! And all you have to do is use some of that money I have paid over the years ON TIME to you and pay for our A/C to be properly fixed. I am on the verge of tears because I am so frustrated. I think it would be cheaper for me to just pay someone to come fix it. I wrote this because I just needed to vent. I cannot vent to my children because I am the fixer, not the complainer. I cannot vent to you because it is clear, you do NOT care about us. You care about rent and water money orders being on time. But I am done venting. I hope someone out there reads me and maybe understands me. "

She will not answer questions that we have, She doesn't even help us figure out certain problems we have in a question that she gives us( Even when we have written our code to show her that we are indeed working and not slacking) she doesn't care about students who are having problems, She is a selfish,arrogant, bad-behaving  incompetent lecturer who doesn't even know how to teach people. Se is using a stupid [outdated book](http://www.amazon.com/Schaums-Outline-Programming-John-Hubbard/dp/0071353461) that has errors( I have seen compilation errors in the book) and not even teaching us out of her own understanding of the subject. She literally comes in class,makes us write shit tons of notes from the book without explaining to us properly what the fuck it all means( The hideous amount of technical jargon is ironic since it was a book supposed to be easy for beginners in C++).  She is a psychopath who unfortunately hid her true self and was able to get hired to torture people. It's like she entered the profession just to get some money since its like she is the only one who has a little knowledge on the subject so far at my college in Jamaica. She said she doesn't like children and lives alone( When she was introducing herself at the very first class). I should have took that as a warning but then again i cannot drop the class since it is a Core class(part of my Major as you would say in the USA). I never had these kind of problems before. I had a previous lecturer who was male and he was totally the opposite of this fucking bitch. The guy got me to like programming and he was a very good teacher( He answered our questions, helped us with our weaknesses and was very fucking reasonable when it comes to due dates). It's things like these that will make me start thinking of being sexist and misogynistic  towards women in the teaching profession. I have never had luck with female teachers. I always did better when the lecturer is a man. Female lecturers( At least in my country) Always have some sort of fucking uppity attitude problem that I really cannot stand. I really wish to kill this woman right now as I am typing this. I  AM DEAD SERIOUS. I WANT TO KILL THIS FUCKING BITCH!!!!!!"

I am not angry because I am short or Asian (I have very few problems pertaining to my height or ethnicity). I am angry because I constantly see women who, as the great comedian Bill Burr says, want to \"cherry pick\" their equality... \"Same amount an hour, I'll take that. Pay for the movies, you can keep that shit!\" They fight for the right to be in military combat jobs yet they seem to be fine with the fact that their physcial fitness requirements are substantially lower than men's. They want the right to say the worst and most heinous shit to men but are never ready to receive the ass kicking that a man would receive for saying those same things. I have witnessed a woman fuck 2 guys (they left the door open at a party lol) and claim rape the next day to avoid ruining her marriage. Believe that it was rape? I don't because I saw her riding one guy and blowing the other one as I walked by the room. She also screamed \"yes\" and \"harder\" several times. She didn't get away with it but she would have if there hadn't been so many witnesses to the contrary. But because she was sleeping around and made a mistake, she was going to let two innocent men go to prison for her slutty ass. So in my eyes, if you want real equality, actually strive to be equal. Get women to push themselves and achieve the same standards as men so that they can be seen as true equals. And if you women decide to lay your hands on a man OR woman with bad intentions, be prepared for bad intentioned retaliation. Bye bye!"

He will rarely reply to my skype messages, oh and forget actual texting 100% chance he WONT reply. anyway on skype if I never messaged him we would never talk again ever. how tf is that friendship on his part? It's not like we fight or don't get along I mean we're like almost the exact same person except for his attitude. When I've confronted him about the issue he says he's too busy or that he doesn't like messaging (but he won't call either) some bullcrap like that, and then I have to remind him that I'm freaking running a startup business so you have no freaking clue what busy is, and I've gone to college too and it's that bad. He has time to fucking post stupid stuff to Instagram... we used to talk every day and I didn't have to initiate conversation every time, and some part of me tells me he doesn't want to talk about the same things I am but then he should initiate the conversation or just fucking say so. Then I have another high school friend that does almost the same thing but it doesn't bother me as much for some reason with him... oh also neither of them sent me a Happy Birthday message on my birthday which was April 9th. They both knew, and then a day or so I messaged them both and I said \"thanks for not wishing me happy birthday\" and Friend 1 never said anything in over 3 days. the other friend just said \"My bad.\" HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU BE SO RUDE. It has been over 14 days since the first friend has said anything to me, I never did anything to make him mad or anything I have no fucking clue but it's really pitiful and getting to me if he doesn't fucking change (he wants to eventually work for me in my business) I cannot and will not put up with his shit. and have to forget him. At some points, I get so fucking enraged at his attitude I can't even put together a sentence. Most of the time when I say like \"Oh you finally replied\" or anything similar about it he says something stupid like \"Why u so mad\" or something, I wasn't freaking mad but now I'm pissed cause your attitude is rude as shit.\nAnyway just wanted to rant. Hope he can change it back around"
