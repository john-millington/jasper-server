To everyone who's had a panic attack or indulged in something you shouldn't have.\n\n I want to send you a message of support in this sea of frustration, panic, and uncertainty. I wish I knew the exact words to help everyone who's in one of these positions today, to be able to make a positive impact in your life, and give you solace. Unfortunately, I can't, but I want you to know that mistakes and slip ups don't define you. Sometimes anxiety is so powerful it feels the only way to drown it out is to mindlessly scroll on your phone, or to have that beer you said you wouldn't have. Being on this subreddit in the first places means you have made a conscious decision to seek support and self improvement. You can get through these days, and if you feel like you can't, please seek out professional help. You are worth it. \n\n I had one of those self sabotage days today. My social anxiety has been crippling, I skipped the gym, smoked those cigs I planed to toss out, and spent today watching youtube videos instead of doing my work. I know that on these days seeing a post like this would help me, and that's why I'm writing this, so people in my situation today can see that they aren't alone this Sunday. \n\nCheers to making it though these nasty days, and to here's to knowing we'll get through this. \n\nEdit: This post blew up more than I thought! I wish I could reply to all of you, but I'm super busy prepping for exams (that's right, today's not a self sabotage day like yesterday). I feel so happy that what I've said has helped people. S/o to the awesome community here, and to my fellow anxiety sufferers for being so welcoming and supportive to each other. Let's make today great!"

Anyways, throughout the past year there have been little scares that my anxiety would rear its ugly head, but I was able to cope and control and really pushed myself (especially because I didn't want to scare him off at the beginning).\n\nHowever, over the past 3 weeks, things have been going a bit downhill, building up to a panic attack a couple days ago and since then I've been seriously on edge, tense, and nervous in between some pretty bad lows.  \nAnyways, my boyfriend would get so frustrated when I couldn't explain to him in a simple and immediate way what was happening since he's never dealt with this before and didn't understand (he is a super logical person).  His impatience when times get tough had caused little problems in the past and so it made it that much harder for me to want to open up.\n\nLast night though, he came to my house (he knew I was feeling pretty bad all day and left work early), and he marched right to me and wrapped his arms around me and said \"I'm so so so sorry.\" over and over.  He explained he has been reading about anxiety and he's been doing everything wrong - he'd been trying to fix everything, telling me to just stop, getting frustrated... He told me he'd be there for me for whatever I need, whether it's a silent cuddle, a walk in the park, or an ear to listen, and at **my** pace. He'd be there for me as a support until I'm okay.\nIt meant everything to me. "

I\u2019ve never admitted this to anyone but sometimes, or most of the time maybe, I don\u2019t want to live past 40. Or maybe even 30. I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t have anything to live for because that\u2019s so untrue but at the same time, I don\u2019t want my looks to fade and I don\u2019t want to watch and feel my body deteriorate as the years go by. I never stop thinking and sometimes I just think that really bad anxiety causes this but I\u2019ve never been properly diagnosed before. And sometimes I just feel so incredibly depressed but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s how everyone feels or just me. I\u2019ve definitely thought about dying before. But don\u2019t worry, nothing to be concerned over, just thought about it. I don\u2019t know if it counts as suicidal thoughts since I wouldn\u2019t actually kill myself. But when thirty comes creeping on to me if I am still alive by then, I fear I\u2019m going to fall into a bad depression. Worst than the one I\u2019m in now. And all this just sucks bad because I\u2019m all about living in the present but yet I mourn over a past I never had and I never stop thinking about my uncertain journey into the future. I don\u2019t even know what I want to do with my life. I am an artist and a writer and I would like to go to art school but I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m good enough. I hate to say this but sometimes I just want it to all end before I graduate or something like that. That\u2019s how terrified of life I am. It debilitates me at night. And I just feel like crying now because graduating high school is like the end of my teenage era. One I\u2019ve really enjoyed and cherished. And one of the hardest things about leaving is this one teacher I\u2019m going to leave behind. My art teacher. The thought makes me tear up. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to deal on graduation day. But back to the story of all this, I\u2019m afraid of growing old and living past my youth. I just need some guidance. This isn\u2019t something to be concerned about because I  would never off myself but I just need to know everything will be fine. The panic gets bad. I just don\u2019t know what to do because sometimes it feels like everything is going to fall apart."

I laughed until I had a stomach ache and tears were running down my face.

Its like a game to me, I always like fucking with my family members heads, and at the same time worried I'll get caught for being crazy.\n\nAnyways, let's start with basic facts. I'm 14 years old, I identify as a bisexual female, and I'm extremely pretty.\n\nLet me clarify, since stating that I'm pretty is subjective and I don't like to sound like an idiot. I'm pretty in an odd way. I'm a mix of Mexican, Irish, black, and overall I look white with a light tint of Hispanic color. Don't ask how I ended up like this, I just did. And I do know that not everyone is interested in the same thing, but hear me out. I have big brown eyes, dark auburn hair, pinkish lips, long long hair, and a smile that resembles the joker or the Cheshire cat. Now, being pretty has let me have a lot of advantages, and a lot of disadvantages. Let's start with advantages. All my life, I've had a lot of attention from boys. Whether they be white, black, Mexican, or a mix, I grew up with a lot of male attention. It was always fun for me, having boys staring at me in class, thinking I couldn't feel their stare on me. Or flirting with me, while I kept a cool face on. I played boys like it was natural, and in a way it was. I loved making boys wonder if I was interested in them or not, and always enjoyed a boys company. Even since I was little, I've always felt a deep attraction to people, for certain reasons such as humor, looks, intelligence, strength, or even just plain attitude. I couldn't help it, and as I grew older it became like a game in my head. How long could I keep a boys attention on me, and how long was I going to like it. But in the end, I always grew bored and uninterested. All my life I've thought of what my perfect romance would be, and it consisted of being with someone who wouldn't press charges, someone who would rob or kill with or for me. Someone who's attitude was just like mine, dark humored, handsome or beautiful, interested in the same sick shit I was.\n\nBut I realized, there is no one out there like that. And even if there was, they'd probably be abusive or dominants, and I hate assholes like that.\n\nWhatever. Anyways, romance became a concept in my head, a dream almost, and I realized from a very young age that I was gonna be alone forever, because we all keep secrets that we take to the grave. And a fake love like that isn't worth it to me. That's why, the thrill of a boys attention on me kind of dulled, but still there. However, after a while I started becoming interested in the female population. Ever since I was in the 3rd grade I could remember developing an attraction to girls. A very deep and sensual attraction, not fake, not made up, but very real and very affecting. But before I talk about this, let me say some things first.\n\nI've manipulated people since as long as I've been conscious of my taboo thoughts and feelings. I tricked adults into giving me money, buying me clothes, candy, jewelry, toys, whatever the hell I wanted. I could cry in an instant and sob like my heart was breaking, and than laugh at how much adults were so gullible when I would go home and lock my bedroom door. I could convince a boy from my kindergarten class to kiss me and make him feel guilty about it if he didn't. I can lie in such a perfect way that doesn't leave any traces, any suspicions, or any questions. I loved myself for being so clever, for being so ultimately more mentally powerful than what people thought I was. I thrived on those kind of feelings of power, of the special knowledge that I could make people do what I want. And they would.\n\nIf I wanted someone to hurt someone else, they would do it. All it took was a little bit of manipulation, breaking someone's feelings, thoughts, emotions down and making them believe what I wanted was more important. I just couldn't resist. Ever since I was little, if someone was mean to me, made me look dumb or tried to hurt me physically or emotionally, I could kill them with my words. I've always had a blunt and hard nature. Kind of cold hearted too. I could be the meanest son of a bitch if I wanted to, and I would be. I would prey on peoples obvious insecurities, their weight, their personality, their actions, their clothes, or anything that could have possibly left me the winner in a fight that was leaving me the loser. I hated looking weak, looking stupid and a moron.\n\nI could make people cry so hard, pretend to feel bad about it, but in the end I always ended up loving it. Love that I could hurt someone so easily, kill someone with words so easily and get away with it. I found immense pleasure and satisfaction from it, and I still do.\n\nI continue to thrive on feelings like that, controlling, dominant, and more superior. Everyone in this big bad world has a weakness, and I would point it out like there was no tomorrow. I loved embarrassing people for fun, hurting peoples feelings as a pastime, and feeling happy about it. I still do. I love making people seem weak. Because that's what humans are, weak. Humans are weak, emotional, and pathetic creatures that I can't stand. I don't consider myself human. I consider myself as one of the monsters you should watch out for in the night. You know how when you walk down a dark street, and hope no one tries talking to you or kidnapping you? Well I don't think that way. I am the person you should watch out for when you're walking down a dark road, making sure I'm the one in control.\n\nEven though I'm 14, I've done a lot of consideringly bad things in my life, like breaking the wings of a pigeon for fun, drawing cuts on a girls skin I played with while she was asleep with a needle, hiding my dads gun under my pillow and freaking him out when I was younger, drinking beer since I was 8 and smoking weed since I was 10 but quit because it gave me acne. I've done so many bad things in my life, and I don't regret any of it.\n\nAfter a life of hardship, daddy being deported to Mexico, having to move in a roach and cat infested dump for a house, living through depression and murderous thoughts, doing drugs for a short time, all while having perfect grades in school because I have this idea I could be perfect in every way. After all this, I still came up at the top, stronger and better. But I knew it had effects. Very, very bad effects. \n\nMy mind constantly would go to dark places at any time, at any place. I would see bugs everywhere. White rats crawling on my bed sheets, spiders crawling on my arms, walls, and bed. Snakes in my bed and on my floor. Roaches in my shoes and on my clothes that were hung up in my closet. I would have moments where I would be somewhere public, and people would all of a sudden smile at me. Not in a friendly way, but more of I'm_a_demon_from_hell kind of way. And sometimes I would smile back, but when I closed my eyes and open them again, they weren't there. They never were. I would see color becoming a form, and I would see it in the air everywhere.\n\nAt a certain time in my life, I felt like I was in a dream, where I was underwater and I wanted to set people on fire or make happy people suffer. I still do, in a way. But in a much more sophisticated, calm, and intelligent way. Whatever.\n\nAfter all this though, I started to not enjoy things like I used to. I loved feeling the cold during winter, but now it just annoys me. I loved listening to music, but now it just hurts my ears. Things I enjoyed, I no longer do. And this happened many years ago. It was like a switch flipped. I didn't feel anything anymore. I didn't feel sad, mad, happy, amused, irritated. I just felt numb, but I still laughed like am ordinary person, got angry like a normal person. But I just stopped feeling anything. Except anger and irritation. But nothing. I felt nothing. No joy, no satisfaction, no pleasure in anything. And it fucked with my head so much to the point where I would throw up from worrying so much about my mind and my soul. I was losing control of my own damn emotions. And I despise not being in control.\n\nAs I've said before, I love hurting people and making them suffer emotionally. But this other part of me realizes I'll go to hell for being such a disturbed person.\n\nBut I think I'm in a crisis. On one hand I don't feel anything. When someone cries, I don't understand why. I know the scientific reason for crying, and the emotion that usually comes with crying, but I truly don't understand what the point of crying over someone's death does for you. I don't understand why people would feel sad or happy. There's too many sad things to be sad about, and there's to many sad things to even bother being happy. I've never felt happiness, never. I've felt satisfaction, pleasure, and joy. But never happiness. And I've seen happiness is something that only lasts a second, and theres no point in trying to fight for it in this life or the next. I don't care if people are hurt or sad. I don't care about people anymore. And in a way that's bothered me. This is a bit hard to explain.\n\nBut than on the other side of me, I have an understanding for people. An understanding of what some gay people go through is not right. An understanding that its inherently disappointing to see racists still exist. A deeply upset part of me that dies for victims of repression, molestation, rape, starvation,  murder, and only God knows what else. I feel like giving up in this life, and wish I could take the pain of others away. Die for others, so I could at least be redeemed. \n\nI feel like I'm two people, stuck in one body. One is fighting to become the dark side of me that I usually kept locked away, the other trying to find the will to be good and life loving.\n\nI can be so mean, but I could be so nice.\n\nIts hard to explain a feeling that I'm sure there's no word for.\n\nBut I guess I ultimately feel empty. \n\nAnd my psychotic tendencies stem from a lot of daddy issues, sibling issues, school issues, and drug issues.\n\nI acknowledge that I'm crazy, but I just don't care. Not anymore. I have no regard for social norms anymore. Everything that is taboo by society, is something that I could understand or accept now. I'm completely comfortable with my sexuality and my ability to be charming. I find pride in being a A+ student, even though school is a fucking waste of time. I could be virtually who ever I wanted to be, and no one can stop me. And I loved that. No one had true power over me, not the government, not the devil, and not even other people. The only one I believe to have power over me is myself and God.\n\nWhich brings me to my sexuality. My sexuality is a very big part of me. Ever since I was young, I developed an attraction to both sexes. Male and female alike. I could see myself in a relationship with a girl, the same a straight girl could see herself being with a guy. After I realized what it was officially called, my bisexual nature, I reveled a bit in this new found fact about myself. I loved finally understanding what it meant. And being bisexual had influenced my future decisions as far as making our or having sex with someone went.\n\nI started to do a lot of sexual things when I was younger. I didn't become sexually active, but I was aware of masturbation, making out. After I had lost all feeling in my emotions, I turned to the same or opposite sex for a feel. And I did. I would go to school, manipulate a girl into hanging out with me. Whether at my house or hers, the mall, the park, the movie theaters, anywhere where I could make her comfortable being with me. And than afterwards, I would... Convince her to start \"experimenting\" with me. I always tended to go after pretty girls, who were clever or open to things. It was like choosing someone out of hundreds. I had endless choices. And we would go to her or my house, and kiss. Just one kiss. Nothing special for me, but it was probably uncomfortable for her, and I loved it. After a while, I would lay her down, and get on top of her. I liked being on top, gave me power. And after all my years of manipulation, I could tell what a person was like, how they acted, what they felt. I studied people and it gave me a leverage in what to do to make during our make out session. I understood people on a basic level, and found I could manipulate others just by watching, studying them, and knowing what their zodiac sign was. I don't think people realize just how much a zodiac sign can give a person the key to someone else's mind, thoughts, and emotions.\n\nI'm a Sagittarius.\n\nBut yeah, I've made out with girls to feel something. And I do. A sort of calmness grabs me buy the balls, and I feel content with myself.  Making out with boys was fun too. I always played boys like a game. And till this day, I still do whatever the hell I want. And no one suspects anything. \n\nBut I just want to know, from other people, could I be becoming mentally disturbed. In this whole entire thing, I did not lie. Why would I lie if the truth is so much better.\n\nThere are things I can't say here, but its okay.\nI don't like not knowing. But remember, nothing shocks me. Nothing surprises me. Nothing. I'm the ultimate open minded person. I accept all. Except my own mind."

This was so unexpected- my parents had always been known to be the perfect married couple, envied by my friends and family members. My mom is heart broken, my dad has lost his mind. I spent yesterday changing the locks on the house for my mom and packing my dads shit, consoling my mother and trying not to think of myself but WAIT-THERES MORE. I wake up at 6 this morning not being able to sleep and look for my dog, not being able to find him I go out back and there he is; dead. He choked on something he found outside and died- covered in ants and just a gruesome sight I had to take him and clean him up and take his body to the nearest vet. After that I proceeded to go check on my dad and had to cradle him after multiple breakdowns- this is an old military man- a man I've rarely seen cry in my life. Idk man, idk. I don't if I'm losing my mind, idk what's going on. I feel so betrayed, I'm not a religious man but if there's a God i beg him to just make this calm down. I'm already a pretty anxious person and I also have IBS so I've been pretty miserable but no one knows. I have to be strong- what happens if I fall apart, what will happen to my parents. I'm literally in between a rock and a hard place. I just had to post this somewhere, I had to just write it down."

The thought of not going crossed my mind many times this morning but I remembered something my friend and psychologist said which is just do what you would have done before the anxiety started, so I went. \n\n40 minute drive later I was one of the first cars there, these random guys that were behind me most of the way there parked next to me and started talking to me immediately and I think that broke the ice. There were over 150 cars and I walked around the entire time, never once did I feel panic, need to go to a quiet space for a second, and my worst fear, having to leave early. I was totally fine and calm once I got there and started walking around. What was even better is that I talked to so many random people! I was there by myself and figured I wouldn't talk to many people but I found myself going over to people and asking about their cars or them asking about mine. I was pretty much talking to a random person at all times for over 4 hours. I met a lot of great people and stayed until the very end with only minor anxiety. \n\nSure the benzo did help but lately even with that pill I've been struggling a lot, especially in social situations where I used to thrive. Still, I don't even remember myself being this social before my anxiety got worse, so that's awesome. Just wanted to share, that anxiety can be beat, wish you all the best. \n\n[Bonus pic of my car today, it's the red one](http://i.imgur.com/q782d2y.jpg)"

I did this as a part of a 30-day challenge with my brother and a mutual internet friend we met on Twitter. The 30-day challenge was spurred by [this episode of the Tim Ferriss Show with Wim Hof](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/09/07/the-iceman-wim-hof/).\r\n\r\nWe all completed the 30-day challenge with relative success, only skipping the cold shower a few times each throughout the challenge. What we found most interesting about the cold showers is that we all felt they enabled us to do everyday things that we typically would avoid or delay because of anxiety.\r\n\r\nFor example when we did the cold shower in the morning, we found it was easier to make a phone call that we were dreading or say Hi to an acquaintance in public. Our explanation for this was that cold showers are an anxiety inducing situation, but a safe one that you can do on your own with no one watching. When you do it, it puts a win under your belt early in the day which you can build on. It also just makes your body feel really good, so you get an immediate reward for doing it.\r\n\r\nSince that challenge, I have kept the cold shower practice going and continue to experience these results. A cold shower isn't going to eliminate your anxiety, but I believe it is one small thing you can do every day that helps.\r\n\r\nOh and I'm not under the impression that we discovered anything new here. Polar bear clubs have been doing this for years. Our cold shower challenge was the same exact concept: challenge ourselves to experience cold water and do it in a social context so we can hold each other accountable. It's just a little easier to incorporate into your daily routine.\r\n\r\nOne thing that might limit your results is if you live in a relatively hot climate. Cold water just isn't as cold in Texas as it is in Michigan. It's all relative though, so it still might do the trick for you."

We're talking symptoms that shouldn't be symptoms of mental health: sweating, not being able to sit down to eat food, getting dizzy after laying in bed, watching tv for an hour and getting an enormous headache, etc. I've been in short suffering since Thursday. So much so that on Saturday I went to the ER for the tenth time in three years. That's right - ten, 10, dix, diez. \n\nNow on Saturday I couldn't even bring myself to get out of bed. I've been dealing with this for three years. Working in retail has not allowed me to have the best insurance or at times no insurance, so some of those ER trips were uninsured ones. But I was dying, so fuck me right? \n\nSo I'm sitting in this ER when the doctor comes in asks me what's wrong and swoops out. Nurse pops in, takes labs, gives me fluids and says \"oh I have anxiety too.\" Start the \"everyone has anxiety\" counter: 1\n\nDoctor comes back in to tell me she wants to do an x-ray. She also tells me she has anxiety at times. Make that 2. Another nurse comes in to do an EKG. That nurse works long shifts and he also has anxiety. Three. The tech comes to do the x-ray and tells me anxiety isn't that bad. Let's say four. \n\nNurse comes back and tells me blood work is normal, my heart is okay, yadda ya I'm good. Oh, she also needed to let me know she had anxiety again as well. Five. I had five instances of people down playing a serious mental health illness including the doctor on staff. Why is the stigma around anxiety so fucking laissez faire? Like it's some shit that's gonna get better with time and a bowl of SSRI's. Now it's Sunday night. I still don't feel good. My health anxiety is through the roof and my weird symptoms continue. I would love to make a doctors appointment but I make coffee for 7.50 an hour because I can't apply myself to look for something better. I sweat, I cry, I hyperventilate, I curl up in pain and I start over. \n\nI now know why people don't want to deal with this. It doesn't ever seem to go away. The attitude towards it is appallingly humorous and the best cure is \"drugs, talk therapy but only if you have bomb.com insurance\". No, I'm not going to kill myself. No, don't post the suicide hotline because that does nothing except help those in great psychiatric despair. I'm suffering bad. I feel like I'm dying daily. I gave up all my dreams and goals but I'm still trying so if I can keep going, so can you.\n\nJust remind yourself life is a gift and you really have to enjoy the little things if you're going through a rough time. I understand why it seems like you can't take it anymore. There's nothing left. That's why I understand how people can drive themselves to physical harm with this disease. Don't give up. Keep going. If anyone ever tells you you're just imaging it or that you need some time, tell them to fuck off. Tell them you suffer daily. Tell them you need help. I wish I would have asked for help years ago. Just keep going though and some day you'll laugh at how bad things got. \n\nGood night. \n\n\n\n"

In the past, I have posted a few things when I had been feeling brave enough to overcome my anxiety, but I always go back into hiding.\n\nThe internet, and Reddit, is supposed to offer a free medium for people to freely express and share their ideas, creations, thoughts, and opinions. Despite amazing, silly, and positive things happening on Reddit everyday, on social media there is social pressure. People wishing to get validation from others (karma, gold, upvotes, etc.) Trolls, negativity, people fighting for the top comment or post.\nBefore I even wrote this I researched and found several older /r/Anxiety posts about the same topic, and even a whole article describing how I felt.\n\nEven though I tell myself that I don't care about validation from others, that I don't care about what others think or being judged, I still get anxiety. In the back of my mind, I still have fear that whatever I have to say or do is not worth expressing. That someone has said it before, or that its unoriginal, or that it simply isn't good enough. That all of my thoughts are invalid. And because of that I shouldn't even try. Better nothing than a negative outcome.\n\nOn top of subconsciously fearing others, I fear myself. That whatever I have to say will never be perfect enough or amount to enough. That my high expectations will never be met anyway so why even try.\nAll throughout my school life, I have also struggled to complete anything (anything that involves writing or artistic projects) because of anxiety. It was either 100% or 0%. Which was not a healthy way of doing anything.  This post in itself is being written and re-written for weeks now.\n\nBut at the moment, I am writing this post to try to battle those thoughts in my head. Something, anything, is better than nothing. This post is to tell my anxiety that it doesn't matter who reads this post or how I write it, just the fact that I did it. That it doesn't matter if what I write or do is perfect, or the best or the worst, or way too long, but that it exists. And that my thoughts are valid because they exist. \nAs long as am I alive, I am going to keep trying to find the courage to express myself and allow those thoughts to exist. Reddit is just one small way of doing so.   \n"

Especially over the phone. I get stressed out and start shaking and sweating and stuttering and rambling. There are times when I even get stressed out over calling my dad. Last year, my issues waned a bit, but recently I've had problems at home, and the anxiety and depression have come back.\n\nFor a while now, I've been planning on getting a piercing. I've probably put way more thought into it than I should have, I've researched everything from piercing methods to the cultural significance of piercings throughout history (I overthink things). I knew that the hardest part would be calling ahead and finding a piercer, but that once I found one and had an actual plan, I wouldn't let myself back out of it.\n\nI looked online; I found one. I had the number of the studio written down. I had a list of what I would say when I called. I picked up the phone and rehearsed what I would say a few times. I got a cup of coffee, lit incense, and turned on some upbeat music to help me calm down. It took me a while, and I was still shaking, but I eventually got the courage to make the phone call. Someone at the studio answered the phone, and I was able to ask my questions. It went well. I didn't stutter or ramble (at least, I *think* I didn't). I had my questions answered. I got down to the last one. \"I'm seventeen, will I need parental consent? What sort of ID will I and my parent need to bring?\" Before I could finish asking, the person on the phone cut me off, said you've got to be eighteen, and hung up. Turns out that the one thing I forgot to look up was the legal age in my state.\n\nNormally, I would have been angry at myself for getting stressed out over nothing. Not this time. I actually made a phone call! It seems like a ridiculous thing to be proud of, but I am. Less than a week ago, I almost passed out on an elevator because I was still stressed out over ordering coffee five minutes earlier. This time, I found ways to calm myself down. I did something that was difficult for me. It might have just been a simple phone call, and it may have ended up being a bit of a waste of time, but it feels big!\n\n**EDIT**\n\n*Thank you, All, for the congratulations! I really appreciate it!*"

You can look up r/ShowerOrange but it's mostly just people talking about it or taking photos. \n\nAaaaanyway, I tried it a couple of days ago, and now it's part of my \"anti-anxiety arsenal\". Hear me out: \n\n* For me, the most obvious benefit is that it's like a fast, effective meditation, and a great way to anchor myself after or during an anxiety attack. Your senses are all focused while you eat the orange: smell and taste, obviously, but also the contrast between hot water and cold orange, the texture of the peel, the bright colour against the white shower walls, etc. You're 100% in the moment, focused on your task. \n\n* You can be as aggressive as you want, or as slow and gentle as you want. Ripping an orange apart is surprisingly satisfying. Offloading your frustrations on the orange is a non-violent way to let it go. \n\n* You don't have to worry about *anything*. The juice will be washed away by the water, and you can just let the peels fall in the shower and pick them up afterwards. \n\n* Oranges are healthy! That sounds obvious, but getting some fiber, water and vitamins in your body is helpful when you're in a bad place. Showers are healthy too. Again, that sounds obvious, but have you ever been so paralyzed by anxiety that you haven't had a shower in days? The whole thing is very refreshing, and a good way to boost your energy. \n\nSo, yeah! I was skeptical before trying it, and just thought it would be cool. But it turned out to be really helpful for me. Give it a try! =) "

            "value": "Hi guys,\n\nI've had anxiety since I was 17 (I'm 25 now), so about 8 years. It was very bad for 3, then died down a bit, then came back after smoking some weed in Feb.\n\nI read a book called \"At Last A Life\" which I can honestly say has helped me understand anxiety a whole lot better than ever before.\n\nHere are some of the crowning bits of knowledge I've learned.\n\n1. You are NOT going mad, you are just a sensitive person with anxious thoughts. That's perfectly okay. Many people have strange or upsetting thoughts every day, however, we are so sensitive that we get worried or upset about these thoughts. It's this reaction to the thought that causes anxiety, not the thought itself, so (as hard as this can be to do), just ignore the thought. If you think of something awful happening, just say \"yeah, grand. This is just an anxious thought. Whatever\".\n\n2. Anxiety can't be gotten rid of like a flu, but it can be managed so well that it feels like its gone. \nOne of the best things I've learned is that I will always have anxiety, I am by nature of a nervous disposition. But that's okay with me. I am learning to be okay with it, I have stopped fighting it. I don't beat myself up about it and I move on each day. In essence, I am reducing my anxiety about having anxiety. \n\n3. Deep breaths. You can't panic and relax at the same time. You can control your breathing which in turn controls your heart rate. When you get that sinking feeling of anxiety, take 10 nice long deep breaths while repeating the following: \"I am a good, I am kind, I am okay\". This will give your mind a positive message to focus on while you slow your breathing and relax.\n\n4. Stop trying to figure out how to control or stop anxiety. You continue to give it more power which increases its hold on you. Accept it.\n\n5. Remember that an anxiety attack is a release of adrenaline into the body. Your mind believes there is a threat so it releases adrenaline into your system to help your caveman body deal with it. This was great when the threat was a cheetah but not so great when the threat is a thought you can't run away from. But understanding what the panic attack is allows you to relax slightly. \nSo when a panic attack starts, realise that this uncomfortable sensation is just adrenaline rushing around your body, it can't hurt you. Although it is uncomfortable, nothing can happen to you. The adrenaline will stop soon and you will feel better.\n\n6. Apparently 1 in 10 people in America have anxiety. You are not alone and you are not as isolated as you feel. You are one of many who feel this way so don't feel like you are all alone and the only one who feels like this. You are perfectly normal and this is going to get better over time. As you learn to deal with it, it gets easier and this happens with time. It won't be gone tomorrow so don't put pressure on yourself to fix it. \n\n7. Buy the book I mentioned above. It goes into great detail and is written by a guy who dealt with anxiety for 10 years before he learned how to deal with it. \n\nI wish you well guys. Remember that people with anxiety tend to be very nice people who get upset because of their thoughts. That just shows what a lovely bunch we are. Those horrible thoughts of you doing something bad, having something bad happen to you, bad things happening to other, worries about the world, economy, exams, etc, etc are only just thoughts. One you learn how to control your reaction to them, you will learn how to control your anxiety. Hope this has helped!\n\nLove to all!\n\n\n\nEdit:\nI'm glad to see that this post has helped so many people over the past 8 months. I would like to add a new point to the list which is my favourite so far.\n\n8. When you begin to feel anxious and get that sinking feeling in your chest/stomach, you probably feel like you want to run away. This is normal but we all know that running away from thoughts doesn't really work. The technique here is to sit there and say to yourself: \"Okay, Welcome back anxiety. I am going to sit here and be as anxious as I can for the next 5 minutes. I am going to feel every anxious feeling and I am going to try and be the most anxious person in the world\". Remember back to point 5 that anxiety cant hurt you, its just a sensation caused by a rush of adrenaline. Sitting there and trying to feel anxious removes all of its power and gives you back control. Its the opposite of what you've probably been doing so far isn't it? It really works for me, I realise that I am in control and that I am not afraid of feeling this way. The feeling dissipates and I am left feeling really delighted with myself! "

            "value": "There are some things I want you to know about me and my condition.\n\nI am not necessarily shy, that's not what having a panic disorder is. I am an outgoing person who often feels trapped inside a wall of fear. I get really angry sometimes because what I feel like is the real me is trapped behind my anxiety. I probably want to be affectionate and laid back and fun at any given time but you make me nervous. It's not your fault, it's just people- it's nothing you do or did. I can only become desensitized to people by spending a lot of time with them and even then sometimes it doesn't work. Sometimes, with some people, it works right away.\n\nI know that what I'm afraid of isn't real. I know that the threat is an illusion and that I'm not really going to get hurt, but my body is telling me otherwise. I try to talk myself out of it but \"fight or flight\" is one of the most basic and powerful instincts of the body, and it doesn't always listen.\n\nI am working really hard to combat my anxiety disorder. Some days I start to give up because I've been fighting for so long and it doesn't seem to change, or I make progress and then I backslide. It's inevitable that I get depressed and may not seem to be working to help myself. Having an anxiety disorder is really hard and I promise I'm doing what I can. Much of the fight that goes on with my condition happens inside the head, so while it might not seem like I am trying to help myself, I am.\n\nI am constantly exhausted. If your body went through intense terror each day (or sometimes, just from time-to-time) and then crashed, you'd be exhausted too. I have to make myself move when I am crashing and sometimes I just have to sleep. My body doesn't present that as an option; it's just an order- \"You. Sleep. Now\". Sometimes I don't get things done because I am tired. Please don't get mad at me if I don't always do everything I am supposed to do- it can be a real struggle to do little things that most people don't think twice about, like walking into a store, running errands, sometimes even leaving my house.\n\nSome of my behavior might seem pretty odd at times. I might make someone go with me to places I ought to be able to go to alone because I need a \"safe\" person there. I might come off as clingy and dependent on others, but my reasoning is not what you might assume- \"safe\" people are our anchors to sanity. Real or not, we assume we can count on them to help us if we become terrified, and that can make the difference between fleeing a place or being able to stick it out. We develop triggers in specific places and that place, as innocuous as it might seem to you, scares me to death. I don't want to feel that way; it's embarrassing, but I do. How would you feel if you were terrified out of your mind in a place or around a person you know is harmless in your heart?\n\nI try many things to combat my anxiety. If you've heard about a technique, I've probably heard about it. I've tried meditation, yoga, acupuncture, keeping active, positive self-talk, cognitive behavioral therapy, regular therapy, and medication, among things. I've probably tried lots of different medication. Anxiety disorder (and depression, since the two are linked- you'd be depressed if you had an anxiety disorder) often get treated with strong medication, and strong medication has side-effects. When I am trying new medications I might be \"off\" and irrational. Please forgive me, it's not me, it's the meds. Also, some meds make me extra tired or dizzy or any number of other things that aren't my normal or desired state. Most medication used to treat anxiety is something the body becomes immune to over time, so the dosage must be increased. So, occasionally I may relapse when I am not expecting it. I don't necessarily know the cause.\n\nPlease don't make fun of me when I am experiencing a panic attack- it's horrible enough without you ridiculing me. You wouldn't be laughing if you were the one whose body was revolting in fear. I'm not making anything up, I'm not trying to use panic attacks as an excuse not to do things, and I surely don't want to be a burden on you or effect your life negatively. Knowing I sometimes am and sometimes do adds to the misery of the condition. What I really need is for you to let me hold your hand or your arm tightly at times, and to humor me and just tell me it isn't real and I don't have to be scared, even if it's the millionth time you've said it. Tell me you'll protect me and I might just believe you, because I want to so badly. I want to be tough and independent and in control, but something (psychological and chemical) inside of me won't let me be free.\n\nPanic disorders are almost always genetic and are chemically related, though they're often triggered by a traumatic event. Before realizing what is happening to us, most panic disorder sufferers go through a terrible period of thinking that we're dying when we're having a panic attack, or that something terrible is about to happen to us, etc. It's impossible to understand when it first happens, unless someone is there to warn you. There usually isn't.\n\nMany of us live in terror of letting other people know we're freaking out, so while we might seem normal, in control, and calm, our insides are often a different story. It's ok to tell us we seem stabler or more confident- we'll appreciate you noticing. Just know that sometimes it might be an illusion, sometimes true one day but not the next. Acting like it's a result of something we didn't do is a double-blow, the first one being our own senses of failure for not being able to just \"tough it out\", \"grin and bear it\" etc.\n\nSometimes, just walking into a room by ourselves is the accomplishment of the day. Sometimes, we could lead a parade. Please, give us the credit for living with something so tough and managing to do anything. Please, just support us and help us, and listen to us. It's natural to get annoyed sometimes, but if you're annoyed, we're probably beating ourselves up because we're a self-critical lot. That's part of how we got this way, by being too self-aware.\n\nWe are trying to win the battle, but some days we just want to give up."

A few minutes later, as I sat alone, I was hit smack dab in the gut by feelings of guilt and hopelessness. Lately I've been feeling very unenthusiastic about life in general, not really excited about the prospect of a potential sixty more years in a dull repetitive cycle that only leads to death. A feeling that says it wouldn't be so horrible if I didn't exist. \n\nNormally I can win over these thoughts. Remind myself how loved I am by my family and friends, that I'm safe and secure and have a lot to be grateful for. But it was like my brain switched into autopilot and I felt myself walking to the closest bridge to jump. Luckily I didn't find it, but I did pass the emergency room on my walk so I took that as a sign. A few tearful hours later, I was voluntarily admitted to the nearest psychiatric ward for monitoring. Got to talk to someone, was given a room and a sleeping pill and then woke up feeling very raw. \n\nI got breakfast, played some cards with the other patients and got to see a psychiatrist. His evaluation was that I seemed to have all my wits about me, and that I'm not any harm to myself. So I'm getting picked up in about half an hour. \n\nThe ton of supportive messages I've received moves me to tears. I can't believe how close I was. I just need to stay strong and never give in. I do want to live, but it's hard and I feel weak and incapable of handling life on my own. \n\nThanks for reading. "

I\u2019ve finally taken the courage to realize I need help and so wanted a referral. \n\nThe doctor barely looks at my chart. He didn\u2019t even ask why I felt anxious. He asked me what I want to do. I told him I want to see a psychologist. He asked if I want meds. I told him no. He told me both those things won\u2019t help. I should seek help from family or church. I told him I don\u2019t see those sources as being helpful. To which he went into telling me to have children. It will give me purpose in life. I was shocked. I told him that doesn\u2019t seem like the right medical thing to do for this. \n\nBut he took it upon himself to give me a lecture about women, biology, genetics, evolution, and how the opioid crisis is due to men not having children and real jobs. He told me that women are so stressed these days because they work too much. He said that in the old days they were even more stressed - why? Because they didn\u2019t have washing machines. He went on and on about how women should be having children and so should men. Some crazy biological link to all this. Nothing really about how exactly it helps anxiety. \n\nI was livid! He knew nothing about me and nothing about my situation to even have children. It made no sense and felt like a violation of my right to even choose to have children. Plus he wasn\u2019t really medically doing his job. He just spouted his agenda. I got the referral and I told him I will never come back there. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine someone closer to the edge of despair with anxiety and seeing this guy. I\u2019m now shaken by this event which is causing me to feel anxious. As a women I have to say to other women - do not take this shit! Also - really?! - having children cures anxiety. Omg. "

My idea of a good time is sitting with someone playing video games, or watching netflix/youtube and discussing what we are watching, etc.\n\nI always had an interest in producing music, but I feel like I can't focus on those things because they are isolated activities and I have this large looming cloud over me telling me I better get moving because I have no friends and girlfriend.\n\nI have been saving up for a downpayment on a house, and I'm pretty much there, but now I don't even know why I want that. A house is for a family, why the hell would I want a 3 bedroom house all to myself? Maintenance costs would be through the roof.  Why would I want a house if I'm not with anyone.\n\nI honestly don't know what I want anymore. Every single day is the exact same, go to the job I f'n despise, and then come home to an empty apartment and sit around. It's even worse in these months because it is so bitterly cold outside that there is no point in doing anything else.\n\nI honestly don't see a future for myself. I feel I am at the stage where I am beyond help. I don't see myself ever being with anyone, and I will just become someone who's office job is all they have. I already know my family is disappointed.\n\nMy mom actually sat me down a couple months ago and told me she was extremely worried about me because of the no girlfriend/friends thing.\n\nMy sister constantly yells at me that I am destroying my life, but her lectures just stress me out even more.\n\nMy entire life my family has done what I call \"cheap shots\" at me.  Little mental abuse situations.  Example:  I don't see the ketchup sitting on the table and go to the fridge, not seeing the ketchup i ask \"oh, we're out of ketchup?\"  to which my mom will reply \"It's sitting here on the table, what the hell are you, fucking blind?\"\n\nLittle shit like that, adds up over the years.\n\nI honestly don't think I will make it to 40 years old.\n\nI have had multiple online dating profiles for the last 8 years. I have not once had any luck. I try to make my profile as interesting as possible, soliciting feedback from people. I have not once received a reply from anyone that I message. I have even paid for these services. It has been the biggest waste of time and money.\n\nAnother thing that causes me lots of anxiety is my teeth. Cavity after cavity no matter how much I brush and floss. All the teeth in my mouth have fillings, some more than one. I even have 2 crowns. I am pretty certain I will lose all my teeth when I am older. I have been told that I might need braces. All that does is further drive me into deeper depression. I can't mentally handle possibly having braces at this age. Would make me even worse than I am in terms of looks and dating.\n\nI have a \"friend\" whom I text with a lot and he told me that he doesn't ever see me with anyone unless 1. they were a gold digger, or 2. it was a single mom with kids.\n\nDo you know how terrible that feels?\n\nI constantly overthink everything. Thinking about my hopeless future gives me terrible anxiety.  I have a feeling of dread every morning going to work, which I think are mini anxiety attacks.\n\nI posted in another subreddit about finally going to a therapist but I felt like he felt that my problems weren't real.  Saying things like \"It sounds like sitting on the computer has gotten you nowhere.  Have you thought about doing outside activities or joining groups?\"  GEEE!!! SUCH CLARITY NOW!!!\n\nThe funny thing is, is that when I'm alone on the computer I actually feel comfortable.  But deep inside I have this voice telling me that things aren't OK.\n\nDon't become me.\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for the responses.  A lot of people here say I have independence going for me but I forgot to mention that I pretty much don't.  After work I go to my parents house for dinner every night because I can't cook and that would require me to eat out every night.  On the weekends I sit at my parents all day because I have nothing else to do.  So my apartment is pretty much just a shack for me to sleep in until I have to go to work the next day."

I have lent her money, given her food (I have a family to feed), I have lent her every movie I own, given her milk and sugar countless times, plunged her toilet, helped her set up her internet and cable, listened to her cry about whatever's bothering her today. She used to make up wild stories all the time about people watching her from my back yard and wouldn't stop when I said there's nobody there. I put up a motion light FFS.\n\nGood lord why have I done all this? I'm not even her friend. Wow I'm a chump.\n\nAnyway. She just called me and asked me to get her smokes and she could pay me back tomorrow. I said \"I'm sorry, I can't\". She asked if I didn't trust her and I said that wasn't it at all, that I just have to start saying no to people. \"Not just you, my sister as well as others\".

She came over for the *third* night in a row to say that someone stole her outside lightbulb and needed my husband to put in a new one. We had company over and were literally sitting down to eat, food on plates already. I said \"no, sorry, he can't, we have company...\" \"Oh but I need it to watch...\" She starts getting upset and I said \"even if I asked him he's going to say no as we are literally just sitting down to eat\" \"well I don't know what I'm going to do\" \"sorry\" then she gets all snobby as if to say \"thanks for nothing\". What a shitty person. She acts so sweet so though.\n\nAs I type this all out I feel outraged. I've always known it's been bullshit, and generally I'm not the one to put up with shit, but I can't say it to someone's face. Because I fear conflict so bad, I guess.

I was raised in FL, USA my entire life and I have always been a water baby. I\u2019m a strong swimmer, and to this day, love the beach. I have no problem in pools, or in the ocean as long as I\u2019m in swimming distance from the shore. Like I said, maybe 10, 12 years ago I was parasailing with family and from that height, and that far out, all I could see was vast ocean. When they started to bring us down, I could tell they were going to dunk us in the water before pulling us in. I absolutely panicked. I couldn\u2019t explain what I was afraid of but it\u2019s something to do with the water. Legit, writing this now my legs are clenched in anxiety. From there, I started noticing it. It was a trip to the aquarium, a video of a massive wave. Growing up in central FL, the home of numerous theme parks (thanks for the after school job, Disney) and water parks I went on a slide that dropped you into a deep tank and I panicked, then a slide that took you THROUGH a tank, panicked. The biggest one I can remember is I walked into the Shamu show at SeaWorld, took one look at the deep, clear tank and had to walk out. Really I\u2019m looking for insight to what I\u2019m actually even afraid of. Like I said, I love the pool and the beach and I currently spend most my days off on the coast (currently living in Dubai, UAE). And just to clarify, I\u2019m not scared of drowning, that much I know. All I can describe it as a a claustrophobic feeling as I said before. Also, it\u2019s gotten worse as I\u2019ve gotten older.

I couldn\u2019t imagine myself there. I couldn\u2019t even go to the supermarket that is literally in front of my house. \n\nA miracle happened by the end of 2016. I decided to take an exam, just to TRAIN. To see if I could stay locked in a room with other people for hours. I never expected to pass the exam. I never expected be able to get into the *best university of the continent I\u2019m from*. I still don\u2019t believe in it... kind of. 2017 was like a dream or something to me. I still can\u2019t believe I made it.\n\nI still have problems. Many problems. I am still anxious, and my anxiety is still an obstacle in my daily routine. However...\n\nI am not hopeless anymore. I can look to the horizon and see a brighter future. I can see myself graduating, I can see myself in a job, and I can see myself slowly getting more socially confident. I feel I can make it.\n\nPlease, never, never give up on yourself. Even if you are housebound or jobless, skipping all of your classes, even if nobody else around you believe in you, keep going. You are much stronger than you think you are, I guarantee it. I experienced it. Just put yourself in a situation where you have the possibility of improving and making some kind of progress.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m so glad this message somehow helped and inspired some people.

I went to a 24 hour clinic and they told me I was dying from my heart rate and blood pressure. I rushed to the ER where they didn't bat an eye and told me it was a panic attack. That thought though stuck with me. I never had another panic attack but lived in constant fear of my heart until January 1st 2017. I tried taking an antidepressant and it sent me into a wild panic of rapid heart rate and hot flashes. I pulled through though and touched it out. A few weeks later, I had one after working out and thought I was having a heart attack. This is what got me me the most and scared me more than ever. I had another the following Saturday and convinced myself that I was fine, but still felt like I was dying. \n\nI went to a cardiologist twice and had echo and ekg done. All fine. \n\nI've been in fear of the slightest bit of exertion from fear of my heart rate now. \n\nThe past year has stifled my music. I haven't written a note in a year. I've been more depressed than any point in my life and just overall terrified. \n\nTonight, in a puddle of tears after battling off the flu for a week ( bad timing right) , my girlfriend came home and hugged me tight. I know this hurts her to see and she's seen it often as of late. I don't know how I'd handle seeing her the way I am. I told her that I'm not weak and I'm just crying because I'm fighting so hard. She told me \"I know. I'm just waiting on you to come back.\" ...... This hit me so hard and it's so true. I'm a shell of myself and occasionally, I show up to fill the void. I'm still happy and myself, but compared to how I used to be, these rapid shifts aren't me. I was so carefree, daring, creative, and fearless. I'm afraid of losing who I was. I went into the bathroom and looked into the mirror and for the first time in a year, I feel like I saw my own reflection. I know the battle isn't won, and I've got a long way to go, but something just snapped tonight. \n\nI understand what you're all going through. We're all in it together. Don't lose yourself because you're still in there. There is still spark. There's hope, happiness, and a face full of smiles that you probably forgot about. You may run to the bathroom at work to let out a few tears like I do, and that's ok. You may cry yourself to sleep at night or cry in the car. \n\nLet me just tell you this. You aren't weak. If you were weak, you wouldn't be fighting. I honestly don't know what inspired me to post this as I don't post here ever. This is obviously an alt, but I just wanted someone to hear if anyone. \n\nWe're all going to get through this. There is an end and a light. You're fighting every day and while you lose the battle some days, you win some days too. Don't give up hope and don't lose yourself. Much love from someone like you. "

I wasn\u2019t born with those skills.\u201d\n\nThese are all doubts, they are complaints, and the only thing they say about us is that we are human. \n\nWe all have self-doubt, I sure as hell know I do.\nBut the next time you think one of these complaints or something similar, think \u201cWhy do I belief that?\u201d \n\nQuestion why you have a certain belief structure.\nAre you sure it\u2019s true? Or could it be a lie? Could it be a story you have told over and over without any evidence?\n\nIf I tell myself that \u201cI\u2019m not a good writer or I have never written before so ...\u201d what I am really doing is saving myself from the disappointment of maybe being bad at writing. All the sudden, I\u2019m not doing something I want because I am afraid I might not succeed at it. My brain has developed a BELIEF STRUCTURE that is preventing me from writing. \n\nBut by asking questions, I am able to question my belief structure, and then change it into one that says \u201cwhile I\u2019ve never written much before, I am capable of doing it.\u201d \n\nWe can shift our belief structures so they they serve us, not prevent us from achieving what we want. Instead of questioning the world, question your beliefs about the world. Question your belief structure, and develop an attitude that serves you and your goals, rather than finding areas in your life to complain about that inevitable make you a prisoner to inaction. \n\nSo once again, I ask you... WHAT STORIES DO YOU TELL YOURSELF?\n\n10.23.17 - @PhillipAndrewLA"

I am so relieved and thankful for all the positive comments!\n\n----------------\n\nNot sure if this is the right place, but I tried searching for the correct sub and I felt you guys would probably be able to answer.\n\nI have been seeing a therapist for about a month for anxiety/suicidal ideation.  I live relatively far away, and my commute is about 1 hr by subway.  Subway frequently gets delayed and they only come every 15 minutes.  The first two appointments went fine, though I was 5 min late for the second.  The third I had to cancel because of my job (co-worker called in sick the day of so I had to cancel my appointment). I left ample, but &amp;amp;lt;24h, notice, and offered to pay for the missed session.\n\nFast forward to today. I was again 5 min late. Instead of saying hello, the dude just started chewing me out for being 'disrespectful.'  He admitted he was 'getting heated' and I apologized profusely.  At some point he said, \"Do you even want to get better? What's the point if you don't even respect me enough to come on time?\"  I apologized again, and he said \"Sounds like youre just paying me lip service.\"  I said I didn't know what to say, and he repeated again about disrespect. I was calm the entire time, but he was certainly not.  I felt like my mother was yelling at me for not cleaning my room.\n\nAt some point, I just said, \"This isn't working. How much do I owe?\" He gave me the bill, and again said, *very* snarkily, \"I would be remiss if I didn't say that you are not going to succeed unless you commit, but I do not think you want to.\"  I replied, \"You'll get your check\" and left.\n\nI mean, wtf? Am I crazy or is that wholly unprofessional? I will admit that I could have tried to be 15 mins early but I didn't know I would be yelled at.\n\ntl;dr Therapist yelled at me for being late. Is that appropriate?"

My agoraphobia and social anxiety, inferiority complex(?) deny me the opportunity to visit such kind of places always making me feel incredibly uneasy.\n\nSo today I had some positive reinforcement in class ( :) ) and decided to treat myself to some Western style food at the food court. I decided to tame my anxiety even if it's only temporary. There were so many vendors. I looked around, picked one that would be the most easy to approach (the menu was printed on the counter). That would be easier for me because you don't actually have to talk to place your order (I stutter), you just point at the item, and that's pretty much it. So long story short, I take the order, occupy the only vacant table... in the the middle of the court, sweating through my shirt (at this point). I took a sip of soda, calmed myself down a little bit and prepared myself for the delicious treat that is the hamburger. So that's it, guys.

I could tell he was a family doctor and wasn't awesome about talking about stuff like that. Maybe he was and I just didn't know what to expect? I'd say that if I mess up at work I almost need to leave because I get so anxious and afraid I'm getting fired and he just asked if I was a perfectionist... Either way, I of course couldn't stop crying. I've never talked to an actual medical professional about it. He referred me to their in-house counselor to talk to a few times, and she'll probably refer me to another therapist.

I don't think they could even begin to understand what my anxiety is like. I'm pretty sure I have OCD, and I used to have obsessions that weren't really grounded in reality. Now my obsessions are based off of things that anybody would find anxiety inducing, they're just crippling and much more intense than they are for most. Sometimes I lie in bed, unable to eat, unable to function, because the anxiety about something in my life is crippling. I haven't felt like this in months, until today. I'm not sure why everything is piling up and becoming unbearable. Maybe it's because school is starting soon and a lot of stressful things are coming my way. I talked to my therapist yesterday (by sneaking out of the house and going to the school) and I still feel like shit. Since I have OCD and often seek reassurance, he usually tries to expose me to my fears, just a little bit.

            "value": "This is a crosspost from r/healthanxiety, hope it helps someone\n\nDisclaimer: *I am not a medical professional or psychologist. I am an academic researcher in an irrelevant area and I used my research skills to find out how to beat anxiety. What I discuss below is just my personal experiences and may not work for everyone. Apologies if my English is not that good, I am not a native speaker. *\n\nI feel that this sub needs a bit of optimism and a break from reassurance seeking so here is my experience with health anxiety.\n\nSince I was 21, I would visit different types of doctors a few times a year worrying I had various super rare terminal diseases that I learned from Google. The worse of it was back in 2012 when I was 100% sure that I had a rare disease and could not sleep for three months, before a neurologist ruled this out. I stopped being anxious about my health then, however for the next 2 years, I became anxious for many different things which could probably diagnose me with GAD, OCD, social anxiety, depression and many other anxiety-related disorders. After some point and after being locked in a dark room for several days feeling miserable, I decided to react and try to get rid of my anxiety. I knew I was very good at Googling. After all I was able to find a super rare case of a super rare disease in a forum from 10 years ago, would not be able to find a solution to my only real problem? Below is what worked for me. The first step was to realise why I had health anxiety. That was easy, I was probably anxious about my health because I lost a very close relative when I was 11.\n\nThe second step was to identify when my health anxiety episodes were taken place. Checking my records of doctor visits, I could see that my health anxiety manifests after a stressful period in my personal or working life. The stressful period would cause some psychosomatic symptoms and would trigger my health anxiety. Another trigger would be something I heard about someone dying or getting sick or reading about a rare illness. I was also feeling more anxious in the evenings, weekends or holidays as then I would have more time to be obsessed with my undiagnosed illness that affected 1 in a billion.\n\nThe first two steps set the ground for my recovery as it made me look in myself and helped me identify what strategies worked best.\n\nThe third step in my recovery was to realise that there is nothing special about health anxiety. My view is that health anxiety as well as every type of anxiety are the same: excessive adrenaline that causes irrational thinking and psychosomatic symptoms. All these anxiety symptoms can be explained easily, but as they are so many, I would rather not cover them all to keep it as short as possible, as our anxious minds are impatient too :). This was such a relief for me as I would not have to deal with all these different anxiety labels, but I would just focus on just resolving my anxiety. A definition of anxiety that really helped me when I had anxious thoughts was that \u201cAnxiety causes you to give a much higher probability of something bad happening.\u201d This could be a rare disease or catching the deadly germ from not washing your hands every 5 minutes. This helped me identify what my recovered self would be like: When I had an irrationally anxious thought about something bad happening, I would think that the probability of this happening is extremely low and then I would simply not care as most people in this earth.\n\nEasier said that done, I know. But I got to this state eventually after a lot of trial and error, practice and patience. This is what worked for me: \n\n- A hugely eye opener resource for me is the following link that I cannot recommend enough: http://nothingworks.weebly.com/ I read this several times as it is huge and it is difficult to grasp at first. I think it is better than every other anxiety book I have ever read. I followed most of the recommendations and show great results quickly. \n- I also made an invisible contract with myself that I will stop Googling for diseases, stop asking for reassurance (as the excellent pinned post indicates) and stop caring about my symptoms. Every time I had a symptom or an anxious thought, I would do nothing about it. NOTHING at all and would get on with my life. If most people would not care about a silly thought that does not mean anything, why should I care? Thoughts are just thoughts, they do not represent reality, so who cares? Guess what! The more I did that, the less anxious thoughts and symptoms I had. \n- I would keep myself busy doing things not matter how I felt. I would read books, watch movies, doing all the tasks in my job while ignoring my feelings. I would pretend that I do not care no matter how I felt. I would fake it till I make it. The more I did that, the more I was telling to my mind that I do not care and the less my anxiety was over time. \n- I would be patient and would not expect to recover overnight. I had many setbacks that my anxious thoughts came back. I am prepared to have a setback anytime, but I do not care. As I see them, setbacks are an excellent opportunity to practice my strategies. The more I practiced my strategies, the less setbacks I had. The last one was 1 and a half years ago and lasted for a day. \n- Finally, two proven strategies that have worked since the beginning of time is exercise and meditation. Especially with exercise I started seeing benefits right away. Meditation made me better realise when a worrying thought was rational or irrational.\n\nI fully understand that the above are not simple. Yes, it took me time and practice. In the beginning, I believed that I would never recover. But once I started seeing benefits, I committed myself. And here I am today, a typical person enjoying his life, his time with family and friends and his hobbies.\n\nSo this is my personal story and this is what worked for me. As I said this is not medical or professional advice, it is just my experience. But through my research oo anxiety, I believe that anybody can recover.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions and sorry again for my English.\n"

These days I'm far better now than ever before. Almost free of it.\n\nThe biggest factors were seeing a shrink, doing the Landmark Education (it's a seminar series aimed at breaking down cognitive self-sabotage, primarily)... and quitting caffeine.\n\nOf these three things, the caffeine was the biggest, most tangible game-changer.\n\nI have a cup of caffeinated tea in the morning. That's it. No soda, no coffee, no Red Bull or any other energy drinks; not even coffee ice cream for the rest of the day. I'm also a 4-hour-per-night insomniac, so I thought dropping caffeine would kill me.\n\nTruth is, I'd feel perkier with caffeine in my system. But I'd also be anxious a lot more. It's physical: the crawling-up-the-back sensation. The buzz. The sweating and nerves. It's mental: can't stop ruminating about things, worry about remote possibilities, dwell on past failures.\n\nThere's no question it's the caffeine. I experimented with it, going cold turkey for several months, then adding it back in at gradual increasing doses. Plateaued several times to make sure it wasn't a temporary response to the increase. Sure enough, even at very low doses, the caffeine popped my anxiety. Three cups of coffee over the course of 18 hours would have me climbing the walls.\n\nSo this is an informal study with only one subject, but if you suffer from anxiety and you consume caffeine, in my experience, the caffeine may be boosting your symptoms through the roof. Do the therapy and whatever other work helps. But while you're at it, consider that this commonplace substance, which nature evolved to addict insects to certain flowers, may have no role to play in an anxious person's life."

The shelter was closed due to the holiday. A lady posted his picture on Facebook and said she fed him at 2 on Monday. Unbeknownst to me, the police picked him up and gave him to animal control. The police said he was eating treats, but was very arthritic. (He was 17 years old.) The vet techs who are the only ones with authority to euthanize were off. The AC officer took him to the shelter and killed him without authority. I was looking near where the lady had reported him.\nTuesday morning I went to the shelter first thing. They told me that no one had turned in a dog like that. I gave them his picture and they said they'd keep looking. I posted in on their Facebook page as well. Tuesday they commented and said they were still looking. I drove around all Tuesday looking for him with several friends and family members. I was passing out flyers and half the town was sharing my Facebook pictures. Tuesday at 4:30 I called the shelter. Again they lied to me saying no one had found the dog.\nTuesday night, a lady who works for the police department contacted me and said they had found Max and she definitely recognized him from the picture. I got my hopes up. I went back to the shelter on Wednesday morning and again they denied having seen the dog or anything fitting his description. He said he had talked to everyone there and they hadn't see the dog. I told the AC officer about the report, and he said \"people often make stuff like that up.\" I called the police lady again and got her on speaker phone. She gave detailed information on the officers and my dog.\nThe AC officer finally took me in the back and another AC officer came out and admitted he killed my dog. I asked this jerk why, and he said \"he didn't have a microchip.\" I got violent and started throwing stuff around and they made me leave.\nCarroll County (Georgia) Animal Shelter.\n\n\ntl/dr:  animal control euthanized my dog within hours of finding him when they were closed to the public.

It was the thermostat that made it over heat to the point that the water pump cracked. Anyway, fixed the car (which took all day) and then I am driving and almost crash on some black ice twice so I am going really slow and a cop pulls me over, tells me my licence is expired, and tells me I need a new one. Ugh! I got to pass that damn test again! On the plus side I have passed the tower crane written test I can pass the drivers written test. So that was my day and night and it all has me really over stressed for some reason. On top of all this there is no work \ud83d\ude22 which really sucks because Christmas is coming and I got 3 kids and no unemployment. I have been applying for jobs, but there is really no Human Services jobs open right now. I am hoping to get a job at the Ronald McDonald house, but 38 other people have applied a head of me. ... Oh and I am taking my 12 y/o to his first counseling session because his behavior is out of control I am Kinda stressed about that too because it is our first time also if this don't work they are putting him on medication and I don't want that.

            "value": "Hey /r/Anxiety. I need some help testing something. I've had panic attacks since I was a little kid, but this last year they got really bad. I started to see a therapist, got some help, and started to learn how to deal with them. Most of the time, I work on prevention through heavy physical exercise, (running), meditation, and muscle relaxation exercises. I got prescribed some Xanax for when the panic attack happened. But here's the kicker:\n\nI'm an [emetophobe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetophobia). I get panic attacks when I think I'm going to throw up. Since one symptom of panic attacks is nausea, it all just spirals into a cluster fuck of awful. Anyway, if my panic attack gets really bad, I can't bring myself to eat or swallow anything. So I am too afraid to take the pill that stops the panic. \n\nMy solution to this has been video games. Since I don't have my computer with me all the time, I\u2019ve been looking into phone apps that require excessive focus to take my mind off the panic attack. For the majority of the time, the app [Piano Tiles](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/piano-tiles-dont-tap-white/id848160327?mt=8) has worked really quite well. \n\nBut I\u2019m a programmer. I think I can do better. I want to create a game that is specifically for panic attack sufferers. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been working on a game I call [Panic Pop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codeisscary.panicPop). \n\nEvery little detail in the game is specifically designed to distract your brain. Don\u2019t get me wrong, this is not a relaxation app. That sort of thing never worked for me while I was in a panic attack. This is something that\u2019s goal is to get you into that state of mind where you can only think about one specific thing. That thing should not be your triggers or your fears. It should be the game.\n\nThe game works by having these little circles on the screen slowly get smaller until they disappear. If that happens, you lose. Games over, but you can restart immediately by pressing one button. This serves the purpose of stopping the player/panicker from setting the game down. There is no pause button while in game. You must continue to play. (and not think about whatever is triggering the panic attack) \n\nAt the same time, you\u2019re relatively free to pick your own pace at the start. Every time you tap a circle it disappears, and one or two more will appear, meaning that you can go as slow or as fast as you want provided you don\u2019t let one of them shrink into nothingness. Meaning at the start, the game draws you in with a lot of freedom, and as the game draws on, it centers your focus. \n\nThe game also has a very simple color pattern of greys, browns and soft yellows. It\u2019s meant to be incredibly simple to pick up. There\u2019s instructions, but you shouldn\u2019t really need them. If you\u2019re in the midst of a panic attack, you need the game NOW. Not after 5 minutes of reading instructions. \n\nCurrently, the game is out. But, since I\u2019m really just one dude with a small laptop and a kindle, I don\u2019t really have the budget to really test it with other sufferers of panic attacks. \nThat\u2019s where you guys come in. I need you guys to test this thing out. Get it on your phones, and when you have a panic attack, try it. Tell me what you think. If it helps, great! If not, let\u2019s try to figure out why it doesn\u2019t and shoot me a PM. Or just reply to this thread. \n\nI will make changes to make damn sure it works. Panic attacks suck donkey balls. Let\u2019s get better together Reddit.\n\nEDIT: Wow, so this blew up a lot. Thank you everyone for your support and suggestions. The next update will feature new sounds (Probably [this one](https://www.freesound.org/people/junggle/sounds/30341/) and [this one](https://www.freesound.org/people/junggle/sounds/28826/)), hopefully with the option of changing between different ones. Thank you to /u/eudaimondaimon for showing me these! :) I'll also try to get an option that allows the user to change between different color palettes. I'm also going to try experimenting with the device on iPhone as well. If I can get something to run, I'll probably run a kickstarter/indiegogo for the money to publish it. If it succeeds, we'll hopefully see Panic Pop on iOS! \n\nFor now, share the game with friends, especially those who have panic attacks. Rate the game on the Google Play store if you can, that helps it get more publicity, allowing it to help more people! \n\nEDIT EDIT: So, if you would like to follow the progress of this game, or just see the trailer and some other info about the game, [I put up a page on my website about it.](http://codeisscary.com/panic-pop/)\n\nEDIT EDIT EDIT: New update was just pushed. Fixed the sound issue. Head to settings in the menu bar to change the sound. Much more pleasant :)"

Aside from 5 Doctors/psychologists visits, I have not left my house once to go anywhere else. When I went to the doctors, I was driven, and I pulled my hoodie over my eyes. Two weeks ago, I started not even being able to go down to check the mail. \n\nFriday my psychologist told me it was time to go out. She said I was causing myself to get worse by being scared of the outside world. I get anxiety just from having delivery people come to my door. Just the thought of going for a drive seemed like an impossibility.\n\nToday I woke up anxious. Even after I took my medication, I was on pins and needles. I was dreading every second that went by, knowing I was closer to our(my fiance and mines) 3pm departure time. We chose that time specifically so the restaurant would be nearly empty. At 3 o'clock I started stalling and coming up with reasons why I couldn't go. At 3:45 he pushed me out the door and all but dragged me to the car.\n\nThe ride there was scary but I forced myself to just listen to his voice and not hide my eyes. I felt nauseous. When we pulled into the parking lot and He pulled me from the car, he hugged me and told me this will be fun and I am safe and he will protect me. We got inside the thankfully almost empty diner. Our waiter was so nice. He put me at ease a lot. I just chose something without really reading the menu because I just wanted to get the hell out of there. My fiance held my hand and just made small talk, making me start to laugh. I was able to relax a bit and even ate my sandwich! I was anxious, but I didn't feel like I was going to pass out or cry. We left and made it home with almost no problems!\n\nI am very anxious now that I am home(wtf self) but I am so glad I went! It was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be! I wanted to share this victory with you guys. This subreddit lets me know that I'm not alone. You people mean a lot to me <3"

The main factor, or rather the straw that broke the camel's back was the fact he didn't understand my anxiety and would worsen it with thinhs like his idea that holding me down during panic attacks was brilliant. I told him time and time again that it would only make things worse. But he refused to listen. He had been doing this for about 6 months, but it got to a point where he was causing them out of nowhere. \n\nI started medication 3 months ago and hadn't had an attack, aside from when being held down, in weeks. But that night he insisted I be held down. I immediately went into full panic, and tried pulling myself out of it. But he wouldn't let go, and he kept yelling and pulling harder. I was struggling as he progressed things, which only made me pull harder. He slammed my head into the ground and held me down until my arms were covered in bruises. [My eyes were black](http://imgur.com/ITI5zVO.jpg) and [my forehead had a huge goose-egg to go with my bruised arm](http://imgur.com/o4njqqP.jpg)\n\nHe spent years convincing me I was broken. That he was helping me by doing the things he did. He convinced me that my anxiety made me crazy. That he didn't have to answer to me about anything. If he disappeared for 4 hours longer than he said I was insane for checking up on him. I was so convinced I was in the wrong. That he really did have my interests in mind, and I was too far for help. \n\nSince leaving him I've never felt better. I realized just how much anxiety he caused, and that anxiety doesn't mean I'm crazy. It means I care more, I'm more cautious, that I think before I act. It means I will listen to you, and validate your feelings. \n\nAlthough I'm anxious about all of the court things, and feeling like he's going to come for me, or that my career will be ruined before it even begins, I'm able to recognize that they may not happen instead of being bombarded and told I'm insane. I have someone who listens to my thoughts and talks me through them instead of calling me stupid. It's so freeing to be anxious, because I don't feel like I have to hide it until I explode.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the kind words of support. It's been a rough time, but I feel so much happier in general. I reconnected with a guy friend of mine, M,  and we've begun a semi-relationship. He's much more understanding, and tries to help me cope with my anxiety instead of ignore it. He finds my neurotic habits endearing, and he's been around to listen to my stresses with this situation.\n\n I showed up at court today only to find my request for a deferred prosecution was granted. With this he will be unable to contact me or get in any legal trouble for a year. If he gets so much as a speeding ticket he will be back to court for this. Essentially I just wanted to let this die for now. I have my junior year of college coming up, not to mention many other stressors and truthfully I just want to move on with my life. I'm ready to progress my relationship with M, to make new friends, and to live my life for myself. \n\nI will likely be posting more, as I'd like to speak to others about my anxiety when I have a much better hold on it. Lately I've been able to see the build up and slow it down as opposed to being pushed into an attack. So I will likely chronicle it. :) \n\nThanks again all!"

Walking down the hallway, I felt like \neveryone was watching me, and that they were all judging me in their minds, even though they weren't. \n\nWhenever I would finish a test early, I would pretend I was checking my answers because I didn't want to walk across a quiet classroom alone for fear of being watched.\n\nWhenever I had a conversation with someone, I would later replay the conversation in my head to make sure I didn't look stupid.   \n\nIt got so bad that I would stay home from school just so I wouldn't have to deal with the nervousness that I felt every day.\n\nThis caused problems with the school board because I had exceeded the amount of excused absences. \nI ended up visiting with a therapist who, after I described my situation to her, concluded that I may have social anxiety. \n\nAfter some medication, patience, and the knowledge that these feelings were a product of my own doing, things got better. The medication gave me the ability to place myself in uncomfortable situations.\n \nI started volunteering to present projects, answering questions I knew the answer to, and was able to have a casual conversation with a classmate. After a year I was even able to stop taking the medication all together.\n\nToday marked a milestone for me. In my entrepreneurship class, each student had to present a realistic business plan for an imaginary business. I had been assigned to present mine on the first possible day. It wasn't until five minutes before my presentation that our teacher said the principal would be joining us to listen to our business plans that we had worked so hard to make (we had been working on them for a month and a half). \n\nMost of the students did the business plan with a partner. I however did not. So, I get up and give a seven minute presentation to a class of 30 and our school's principal BY MYSELF. I make a conscious effort to speak slowly, and make eye contact with the audience, as I've learned to do. My voice shakes a little bit, and I start to feel warm midway through, but I ultimately finish strong. \nThe entire class thought it was great and my teacher recommended that I take my business to the DECA Nationals Competition. One year ago I wouldn't have even been able to present in front of a class of ten. So I considered it a personal win. \n\nSorry it was so long. Thanks for reading"

Let's say if I need to go to the Doctor at 11am then go somewhere else at 1pm. I am unable to use my time wisely between 12pm-1pm.

But enough about me!\n\nToday I was heading down to the copy room to print up some tests for my next class, and I saw an overweight kid (I was a chunky kid in school as well) sitting against the wall. He was shaking and crying, clearly having a panic attack. There were other teachers, and someone from security around him. My coworkers (doing what they thought was right) were asking him over and over \"What's wrong\", \"What happened?\", \"Do you need to talk to someone?\", \"Why are you stressed?\". Every time he would just repeat the same words \"I'm just stressed out\", spiraling worse and worse as he was bombarded.\n\nI came over to check on him, and after seeing what was happening I asked if he could come to my room to decompress for a second, i was on planning after all. They agreed, and we walked over to my classroom. I told him that I have generalized anxiety disorder, and that I've done exactly what he did. Many a time I've let it all overwhelm me and I couldn't tell the people around me any one reason \"why\", when it was just a little bit of everything. I told him that he didn't need to explain, that I knew and understood, and my room was a safe space for him.\n\nHe sat there for about 20 minutes, he cried a little more. Composed himself and then told me his name was Eddie. I told Eddie that if he ever needs a safe place that I'll be there for him, and I walked him back to his class, and then ran to make copies of my test.\n\nI hope the rest of his day goes well, and I hope that i've made a good impact on him. Even now I worry that he might be anxious still, but I have faith that he will find the way just like I did.\n\n"

If you can do something external that makes you feel better then you're just sad.\n\nBut I also think this makes me a bit of an arsehole because I am glad that people get better, and I have been told that my experience of chronic and enduring is different from most people's experiences because apparently for most people it is acute and episodic.

My issues specifically surround letting go of things, people, etc, so my thoughts are probably skewed in that direction. \n\n* There is no terror in the bang, only in anticipation of it. (Alfred Hitchcock)\n* This too shall pass.\n* It's probably not going to be as bad as you think.\n* Trust that you can handle the situation when it presents itself, rather than trying to anticipate and prepare for every possible outcome. You will find a solution. You will endure.  You will move on.\n* Set time aside to think, and bank all of your thoughts for analysis later. You can't think every waking moment of the day - you will not come to a clear solution that way.\n* Experiences in life are like waves in the ocean. Some are soothing, some are rough, some are short and sweet, some are long and enduring, but all come and go. Ride each wave while it's high, let it go, and let the next one come when it will.\n* Be at ease with the in-between, the mediocre, the waiting periods. Use this time to set the foundation for your next adventure. \n* No amount of anxiety improve the outcome of your situation. Prepare to a reasonable extent, then let go. Anxiety is not useful when it runs unchecked. \n* Do not fear your anxiety. You are familiar with it, like an old frustrating friend. It is nothing new. You can handle it, you can manage it. It is an illusion.\n* You cannot connect the dots looking forward - only looking backward. You can't know what the future holds, and that's okay. Just use every experience as an opportunity - every experience, good or bad, is a jumping off point for your next adventure, a stepping stone in your story. Your perception of how well life goes will be largely impacted by how you choose to make use of those stepping stones and the attitude you take while you're walking your path. (paraphrased Steve Jobs at the beginning)\n* When one door closes, another one opens. Don't try to prop open a closing door. Let it close. There is always something good waiting around the corner. \n* What if? Do all your what if's end with negative predictions? What if it actually goes super well? What if all the bad things you are trying to protect yourself from don't happen at all? What if they do happen, and you actually handle them just fine? \n* It's okay to enjoy the moment, even if there is a problem you haven't solved hanging around in your life. You don't have to have everything solved at all times. Let it be the way it is. Sometimes you have to wait for clarity. Sometimes you have to live it out to know what to do. It's okay if things aren't quite right or a aren't quite how you imagine they should be.\n* Life has a funny way of working itself out, as long as you are open to it.\n\nFeel free to suggest edits...I'd love to hear some of the things you guys say to yourselves too."

I always have intrusive thoughts about him getting killed, or getting in an accident. It's awful and sometimes it prevents from being fully present in the relationship. Sometimes it keeps me up at night. Has anyone ever felt something similar?\n\n(Also: My anxiety+depression is the most manageable it has been in years. I have been taking Zoloft for about 2 months now, and I've never felt better. However, I still have a lot of worries about certain things, like my boyfriend's safety for example, that haven't completely gone away. Thanks for any advice guys.)"

So I decided to visit here and share my development\n\nI am male and have the background probably most of you have\n1) Super anxious mother, absent dad. No one to turn to when I couldn't take my mom anymore. She did a lot of things that didn't exactly have the outcome of, er, pacifying my anxiety.\n2) Terrified of talking to girls\n3) Might as well have gotten my doctorate for all the research I did into anxiety and all the rumination I expended on. For long stretches, EVERY. WAKING. THOUGHT. of mine was about how to outsmart or out-think or manage my anxiety.\n4) Enormously self-critical of my performance and my anxiety and my thinking\n5) Fundamentally unhappy even though I came to develop compensatory behaviors which fooled a lot of people into thinking I was confident.\n\nI'm not going to spend anymore time discussing the ways I suffered over the years for brevity's sake. If you are interested, go ahead and ask :)\n\nNow on to how I overcame anxiety\n\nAs I said above, I spent many years researching and ruminating and plotting/developing compensatory behaviors for my anxiety. About a year ago, as part of this neverending search, I came across a book named Search Inside Yourself by Chade Meng Tan. It introduced me to mindfulness from a neuroscientific/practical benefit perspective. For someone with a hyper critical mind, I think its emphasis really suited my need for specific outcomes and efficacy data.\n\nAnd so I began to meditate. Being brash, I started off meditating for an hour and spent the hour being utterly frustrated and incensed at myself for not being able to pay any quality attention to my breath. But the next morning, I swear, the world looked more garish, more vibrant. I was sold. \n\nOver the next couple of months I would continue these hour-long sits in which I would spend 80-90% of the time running the mental treadmill over these thoughts \"I don't know if I'm doing this right. This doesn't feel right. I think if I pay attention to the vibration of the breath in my nostrils I'll be able to stay mindful for longer. No.. that didn't work. Dammit! Why isn't this working?\" Sitting turned into a deeply unhappy, hyper-critical time in which I obsessed more about whether I was meditating correctly, or how I could meditate better, than actually, you know, meditating. \n\nI can't even say that I was being diligent in the frequency of my meditation. Over the last year, I've meditated an average of one day a week - maybe. A stretch of 3-5 days followed by some life disruption (usually tiredness) and then 2 weeks off. But I did try during my waking hours to pay attention to my breath whenever I could. Ironically, this meant that I carried the same hyper-criticism and dissatisfaction and unhappiness into even neutral activities. But, in retrospect, it did provide a diversion from my usual, *consuming*, habit of ruminating all day everyday about my anxiety.\n\nDuring driving, during conversations with my mom, and so on I would try to come back to the breath. The intention and determination to stay mindful was always there and I can't precisely explain why. After maybe 5 or 6 months I noticed that my mind was getting quieter. I used to talk in my head A LOT but that had diminished - and would continue to diminish over the months. My anxiety was largely there and my avoidance behaviors and compensatory behaviors and ruminating thinking was still there. I still couldn't approach any girls if you put a gun to my head. I could barely make eye contact with strangers for fear that they would be offended. The self criticism was still strong. I would still rather have died than turned to a friend or loved one and shared my problems with anxiety, or my two academic suspensions from an Ivy League school (simply could not function due to performance anxiety), or that I was a virgin who had never had a girlfriend.\n\nBut something was happening. In an ineffable sense, it got a bit quieter in my head, and then I started to loosen up here and there. I would say yes to invitations from friends (I never accepted ANY invitations from friends before), I would hold eye contact (even with girls!), smile, and even say hi to strangers. Now, full disclosure, a lot of these developments occurred because there were times when I wouldn't feel anxiety. Times, for instance, when I would look at a girl and my chest wouldn't constrict painfully and I wouldn't feel like a deer in headlights. Sans the associated physical symptoms, I behaved healthily. \n\nBut. Nine months in, the higher hanging fruit in my anxiety totem pole - sharing intimate details with people (people, even those who barely know me, have often called me out for being closed off), conversing with my mum (especially about anxiety triggering topics), approaching girls - all of those still triggered the physical symptoms of anxiety and avoidance. I was convinced that the key to beating my anxiety was abating the overwhelming physical symptoms of anxiety which trigger avoidance. I was wrong.\n\nTo cut a long story short, over the last three months, three key events happened which helped break me completely free of anxiety. The first was having my first ever girlfriend. The second was her breaking up with me 3 days after we were together due to insecure, compensatory habits I had developed for my anxiety in the past and my ensuing deep guilt and soul searching, and the third was a meditation retreat I attended.\n\nToday, I still feel anxiety. I still trigger avoidance when I feel the physical symptoms of anxiety. But there's a clear difference in my response. The moment I feel those physical symptoms and that avoidance, I have this ineffable intuitive sense that attending to my anxiety in a certain way only increases my suffering, I have this intuitive sense that *I have a choice* about whether to cultivate the anxiety or let it go, and I have this intuitive sense of how exactly to let it go.\n\nThink of it like playing basketball. You shoot the ball and it goes into the basket, broadly speaking. But you have only an intuitive sense of how you're able to calculate how far the basket is, how much spin to give the ball, what arc to give the ball. Now think of what happens when a beginner plays in a basketball game when someone applies defensive pressure to them. Their brain gets scrambled because of their anxiety and they lose the ability make use of that intuitive sense. But look at a professional player. He is not oblivious to the defensive pressure. It still affects him. But he is still able to recover from the momentary mental confusion and tap back into his intuitive sense of how to direct the ball into the hoop, even though he could never tell you how he's able to do it. \n\nThat's how it is with anxiety and me. It arises like a bubble and I experience it and something tells me that I don't have to continue paying attention to it in a certain way (what 'in a certain way' means, I will never be able to explain in words). So I direct my attention to my breath. SOMETIMES, my attention will instantly go forcefully back to the physical symptoms and my mental confusion will return and this will happen over and over again. The KEY DIFFERENCE is that whereas before I would have questioned whether I was being mindful in the correct way or if my mindfulness was working or whether I needed to tweak my technique or try something different is that I bring my attention right back to my breath, over and over again. SOMEHOW, I'm not sucked into the anxiety. I can't explain it. But it's not voluntary - AT ALL. It just sort of happens in the way the basketball player intuitively knows to fluidly change his pace and his direction at full speed to elude defensive pressure. I could never fully explain it. And that's the thing - I simultaneously have a clear intuitive understanding that if I try to consciously mess with these responses, my anxiety will only inflame and increase. I subconsciously understand exactly how much to get involved and how much to leave alone. I subconsciously understand that attending to the physical emotions of anxiety and mental confusion does something bad to my quality of attention and thinking. How all this came from simply paying attention to the physical sensations of my breath and body, I have no idea - but I really didn't do anything more special than that over the past year.\n\nSo looking back, I can safely say that none of the efforts I made to help my anxiety alone were worthwhile. But, at the same time, I'm not even sure I could have helped any of the efforts. The more I meditate, the more I see that it's a very questionable proposition to attribute any of my volitions or emotions - healthy or not - to my doing. In fact, more and more of my creativity and my performance comes from understanding how my drive to manage and exert control and intellectually master/understand only interferes with beautiful processes which are working themselves out. But if you had told me this a year ago today when I found Search Inside Yourself, I'm not sure it would have made a difference even if I had completely believed you. The brain does its own thing. :)\n\nAsk away! I've omitted and truncated here and there because I realized this was turning into a tl'dr :)\n\n\n----\nEDIT: I'll be writing a series of thoughts here based on things that occur to me or seem to be common threads or concerns.

Last night I felt so sick and this morning I didn't even think I'd be able to make it to the test centre. But I got up on time, I left on time and I arrived early. Walked in, checked in and my instructor was ready for me before schedule. \n\nThe 10 minutes before my test when I was waiting, I was surprisingly calm. Maybe because it was too late to back out, so I just accepted that I was going to do it. The test was pretty smooth, I didn't make any major mistakes, we chatted and I drove very well I must say. 30 minutes later, we got back to the test centre, I did a pretty poor parking job but oh well, the third attempt was perfect. \n\nHe told me I did great and I passed. I was sure I would fail before I did my test or that anxiety would get in the way, but I didn't even think about anxiety. I'm still surprised at how calm I was the whole time, I just drove like normal and checked my mirrors a lot. Then just to push myself a bit more, I went to get some lunch by myself. I feel so relieved, I'll hopefully never need to take another driving test! This really goes to show that I need to stop doubting and questioning myself, because we're all capable of doing whatever we want to.\n\nEdit: Wow this got more upvotes than I expected.

            "value": "I\u2019m not a doctor. Simply compiling everything that\u2019s been helpful for my anxiety and wish someone had told me this information years ago. I\u2019ve posted this on a few other threads but wanted as many people to see it as possible. Apologizing in advance for formatting and length. But please give it a go. Some of the information could be really helpful!\n\nBackground: Got diagnosed with GAD and OCD a while back and have been dealing with anxiety as far back as I can remember. Was on 10mg of Lexapro once a day for a year and a half. While it helped me get through some really tough life shit, the withdrawal, in my opinion, was not worth it. However, this isn\u2019t the case for everyone so do what feels right for you! Anyways, here\u2019s the meat:\n\n1) Diet \n-Cutting out processed sugars and starches has made a huge difference. I've noticed that when I consume said foods, my anxiety \"brain fog\" and depersonalization/derealization gets significantly worse. However, starches can be hard to give up completely. As a fellow carbosaurus, I understand the struggle. I found that replacing white bread with wheat bread has really helped. Wheat pasta is a good substitute too, and there isn\u2019t (in my opinion) a huge taste difference. Also, brown rice instead of white rice. White rice has a high glycemic index and can spike your blood sugar, which leads me to my next point -->\n\n-Low blood sugar can play a huge part in anxiety. Snacking on protein rich foods every few hours can help this. I carry around a bag of bulk cashews to snack on in case I can\u2019t access other food. Most grocery stores now offer those one-serving packets of peanut butter and almond butter, which are so convenient to carry around with you. Slim enough for a pocket even!\n\n-Speaking of sugar, even artificial sweeteners (Sucralose, Saccharin, etc.) have been shown to heighten anxiety. These can be found in diet sodas, low fat foods, gum, and even dairy items to name a few. Honey or agave nectar can be good substitutes. BONUS: Consuming local honey exposes you to allergens in your area, which can help with allergies!\n\n-Eliminating all beverages except water. Caffeinated and/or sugary drinks are basically the devil when it comes to anxiety so I'd cut back on those if it's hard to eliminate all together. \n\n-Alcohol and other drugs can cause anxiety to soar. I've noticed after a night of drinking my depression and anxiety sky rockets.\n\n-Daily Omega. I take two Omega 3-6-9 blend fish oil pills every day and can notice a difference if I don't take them for a week. \n\n-Magnesium glycinate supplements have been said to work for a lot of people. Be careful though because certain magnesium supplements can cause explosive diarrhea\ud83d\udca9\n\n-There\u2019s still debate on this one but salt. Apparently in the refining process of table salt, it gets stripped of minerals and trace elements. Pink Himalayan crystal salt contains 84 minerals and trace elements. Some people even add a tiny sprinkle to their water bottle every day. If you want to try this, be careful not to overdo it as salt can cause uncomfortable bloating.  \n\n2) Meditation CAN'T SAY THIS ENOUGH \n\n-No exaggeration, this in combination with a fixed diet has been my savior. I feel so good I can't go back to living without meditation. \n\n-You don't have to be a guru hippy Mother Earth child to benefit from meditation or even learn how to meditate. There is an app called Headspace that provides excellent guided meditation highly recommended \n\n-Another user told me about an app called Breathe. From what I've read it's provided people with relief and is a great meditation tool. I\u2019d recommend looking into both Headspace and Breathe, as people will always have a preference.\n\n-Guided meditations are great but it's important to know how to meditate in silence as well (you won't always have access to your smart phone for a meditation app). When I do this I set a timer for 10 minutes on my phone. I'll take five deep breaths (in through nose, out through mouth) and then close my eyes on the last breath out. Begin to breathe normally. I'll then focus on my breaths, counting to ten, and then start back at one. Side note: It's okay to lose focus! And tell yourself that when you realize you're not counting breaths anymore. \"Oh, my mind went off track and that's okay. I'm going to focus on my breaths again\" and resume counting. I've been meditating for six months now and still get sidetracked frequently.\n\n-Simple breathing. Whenever I feel the anxiety/nervousness/worry/etc. increasing, I'll go to the bathroom or another private place where I can sit in silence and count my breaths. This works as a good checkpoint through out the day, as I can try to \"refocus\" my mind.\n\n3) Therapy \n\n-Yay therapy! I\u2019ve been in therapy for the past 13 years. It has literally saved my life countless times. Therapy is beneficial for EVERYONE, especially those of us who suffer from anxiety. \n\n-I know some people have a hard time fitting therapy into their schedules or due to financial reasons (right there with you). A quick google search of \"best online counseling services\" ought to do the trick.\n\n-Not sure how it is in other countries but in America most colleges (and probably some high schools) provide free counseling services. These are real counselors and legally cannot contact your teachers, peers, or employers. Also, if you are nervous about your peers seeing you at the counseling center, think about that for a second. You are seeing them at the counseling center. Chances are they are also there for counseling. This can create an immediate and intimate bond between you guys, and maybe even someone to talk to about what's going on in your head. \n\n-For those afraid or who get anxiety about going to a counselor/therapist: Therapists are genuinely caring people. Most of them became therapists because they themselves have struggled with some sort of mental illness and/or a traumatic event. And they are legally required to maintain the integrity of your conversations, meaning they won\u2019t talk to people in your life or others about what you say. Everything you say is confidential. (That is unless you talk about harming yourself or others). I cannot stress how wonderful it feels to have someone in your life whose sole purpose is to listen to you vent about your feelings. One of our basic needs as humans is to feel heard. When we get that need met, we feel acknowledged and loved. This can mean all the world when it feels like no one in your life listens and/or understands the intensity of your anxiety. \n\n4) Journaling\n\n-Bring that pen to paper and vomit out all of your fears, angers, frustrations, sorrows, etc. Sometimes our anxiety gets stuck, and when we give it an outlet, it can make all the difference. \n\n-Writing virtually is good but I\u2019ve found that the act of physically writing out my emotions is so meaningful, and I feel a higher connection with my mental and emotional body.\n\n-In a previous thread I posted this information in, some people mentioned they didn\u2019t like reading their emotions because it made them feel guilty, angry, etc. It is okay to feel these emotions! BURN THE PAPER. Seriously. Burn. That. Shit. Up. Tear it up. Watch it go through a shredder. This is therapeutic! Feel like I have to say this\u2014make sure if you do decide to go the burn route that you do it outside in a receptacle that can handle the heat! \n\n5) Podcasts \n\n-There are a number of very helpful anxiety podcasts. I'd recommend The Anxiety Coach's Podcast. There are two new episodes each week (Wednesdays and Sundays) that somehow relate to anxiety. The host provides listeners with MANY tools for helping with anxiety, as well as an extremely diverse range of topics. I've found that even episodes I don't think apply to my anxiety have always consisted of useful information and helpful tricks.\n\n-Other good podcasts include Anxiety Slayer, Anxiety Guru, The Anxiety Podcast, and The Anxiety Guy. Just like the meditation apps, give them all a try! If you don\u2019t like one you\u2019ll probably like another one more\n\n6) Exercise \n\n-GO OUTSIDE. Studies have proven time and time again that even just sitting in nature and hearing the sounds it has to offer lower cortisol levels (stress hormone) \n\n-Yoga. Any type is beneficial! I've found the most anxiety relief from Restorative Yoga. The whole class consists of three poses (they aren't super complex yogi stances, usually lying on your back in a certain way) \n\n-Cardio is great for \"happy\" hormone production. \n\n-It's important to note which types of exercise make YOU feel good, as it's not the same for everyone. For example, running is great for you but if it's physically hurting your knees, ankles, etc. it's probably not the best for you. There's always a different form of exercise, and fortunately all types of exercise result in decreased anxiety! Any type of movement is better than no movement when it comes to anxiety :)\n\n7) Medication\n\n-Anxiety can be fucking torture. There is nothing worse than feeling like a prisoner to your own mind. Medication can definitely help soften this, especially if you are feeling like you can no longer go on.\n\n-Research your options. Talk to people you know who are taking something about what they like/don\u2019t like about being medicated. Read reviews. Read side effects (this might not be helpful if you are extremely prone to the placebo effect or have health anxiety).\n\n-READ ABOUT WITHDRAWAL. Once again, I am all for medication if you feel it is right for you. When I decided to go on Lexapro, I was 100% sure I wanted to. What I do regret is not researching withdrawal. Not only did I experience two weeks\u2019 worth of physical symptoms (night sweats, racing heart) but also experienced severe depression and anxiety that was far worse than what I\u2019d experienced before going on it. I also have social anxiety now which I didn\u2019t have before. Anyways, the point of this is to research, research, research, and know your options!\n \n8) Random \n\n- \"You Are the One\" by Kute Blackson is an inspirational read for anyone with anxiety \n\n-Posture makes a difference. Sitting up straight builds self-confidence and becomes easier with time \n\n-Write down quotes or phrases or mantras or whatever makes you feel good and hang them up in places where you\u2019ll see them frequently. Bathroom mirrors and inside front door are two really good places I utilize regularly. You can even write down reminders of why you\u2019re working on your anxiety.  \n\n-PM me if you ever need someone to talk to! I\u2019m in the process of becoming a therapist myself so please please please contact me if you need to talk. I will not judge you and love to listen. Anxiety doesn\u2019t need to be a social taboo. \n\nIt's important to note that working on your anxiety is a process. There's not one thing that is a magic cure-all. You'll have great days, weeks even, and then not-so-great days. It's crucial to remember that the down days don't last forever. And as a reminder, be extremely gentle with yourself. It is okay to feel other emotions besides happiness. This may sound weird but welcome them. Allow them to be. The more you resist them the harder and stronger they\u2019ll come back. \n\nOnce again, please feel free to PM me if you need to talk/vent. Best of luck to you on your journey and thanks for reading!"

It's like I took a xanax except I'm not sleepy, I don't \"feel\" it, I don't feel high in the slightest, nothing. There is *almost* no THC. I feel calm, collected, organized, very clear headed. This stuff works for me! I haven't tested it over time but we'll see. I may be traveling to Colorado more until it's legal here, it almost is. A bill almost passed this year & I'm sure it will in the future. 75% of my state approves of medicinal MJ.  \nI encourage anyone with anxiety to try it.

I want to break this habit, but it has progressed so much. When I say sorry, I really do mean it because I feel as though I've screwed up somehow, but I understand it can sound repetitive and insincere to others. I don't want to be annoying, but I honestly can't help it. I apologize for, what others say, the stupidest and smallest of things. If I don't know how to do something I'll apologize for not having the knowledge in whatever it was. On days where I feel really bad and more aware of myself, I just don't speak.\n\nI want to work towards being more professional and not so anxious all the time.

I have a great family life, I live in the upper middle class and I'm in good health.\n\nUnfortunately, my social life is absolute shit. I've never had a girlfriend, or even kissed a girl. I don't have any real friends anymore ,just classmates I hang around at school so people don't think I'm a loner. And the worst part is, I used to be pretty popular, I played some sports, hung out with the \"cool\" jocks, and was pretty socially respected. But over the last few years I've been distancing myself, not talking to my friends because I thought I would annoy them, and getting feelings that they didn't like me anymore. I stopped playing sports because I felt I wasn't good enough to be on a team and I didn't like being watched or put on the spot.\n\nSince I practically lost all of my friends, couldn't talk to girls and just general thought everyone hated me, I developed serious self esteem and confidence issues, and I've pretty much stopped talking all together unless someone asks me a question.\n\nI've always been super skinny, and lanky (the body shape of someone who's over 6'5, but only 5'11), so naturally, I started working out once I lost all my self esteem. I made 0 progress for at least a year which made me feel even more worthless, and it was at this point I started to get seriously depressed, I decided I couldn't do or achieve anything so why even bother? Somehow I managed to persist, and continued to lift weights frequently as an escape from the world. I would put on my headphones, focus on the weights, and forget how horrible I felt. \n\nAfter a little while I started to seriously commit to what had become a 6 days a week regime, and I was dedicated (and still am) to the only thing I still enjoy(ed), bodybuilding. \n\nJump to now, in the last year I've gained close to 20 pounds of mostly muscle, but I also managed to pick up body dismorphia disorder along the way. I can no longer quite tell what I see when I look in the mirror, but I still see myself as that same scrawny kid, only slightly fatter. I still have no friends and avoid social contact at all costs, I hate school, it feels pointless and half of my time there I'm struggling to not break down and cry. Right now the only time a don't hate myself is when I'm high,  but  if I smoke any more than a bowl (really low tolerance) I have a major panic attack usually resulting in throwing up. \n\nI feel so small, insignificant and lonely, I think about suicide usually a couple of times a week, I never really consider it, but I like think about how people would finally notice me if I did, you know what I mean? Anyways, this is the year I will finally seek help for the root cause of all my problems, anxiety, and I hopefully ill be able to feel happiness again."

The media has jumped on it pretty strongly.\n\nWhen you go to look at the headlines and write-ups\u2026.even from more liberal sources (which traditionally are more respectful of stuff like this) like HuffPost, they're calling it a 'meltdown' and a 'self-destruction' and all these words that just further demonize what is a very common condition.  It ticks me off they choose these words to merely drive more traffic to their sites\u2026.they don't understand the weight of what they are doing.\n\nBut here's what REALLY surprised me\u2026when you look at the comments, you see a very different story.  Normally when you read the 'Comments' section of an online story you walk away feeling helpless for humanity, but not on this.  A good percentage are pointing out what we already know, he had an anxiety attack, that's it.  Many pointed out that the guy deserved empathy and space, not ridicule, and it really stuck out to me how much of the online community echoed this thought.  People out there know and empathize with what we are going thru.\n\nI almost hope Bay would come out as a spokesman for anxiety, though I doubt he ever would."

Will I be able to get to the post office and back in time for that appointment? Should I write this down so I don't forget? But what if because I write it down, I take too much time and won't be able to go to the grocery store as well?\" \n\nAnd on top of that, there is a layer of guilt, \"Is this a good use of my time? Is this the best use of my money? Am I being productive enough? Am I doing enough for my boyfriend as well? Am I spending too much time inside? Am I exercising enough? Am I spending too much time online? Am I talking to my family enough? Do people think of me as inconsiderate?\" \n\nAnd then, of course, there's the looming feeling of, my weekend is slowly drawing to a close, the clock is ticking and in 24 hours I'll be getting up for work, twelve hours, six hours, am I going to get enough sleep, five hours, and then, the cycle starts over. I don't even dislike my job, it is very fast-paced and sometimes stressful with difficult social interactions (hotel front desk), but overall it's enjoyable. I just feel like the time that I have to myself isn't really MY time because it's consumed by all of these horrible feelings of anxiety, guilt, and self-doubt. \n\nI'm sure I'm not alone in this, if anyone has any tips on what I can do to ease this, it would be greatly appreciated. I enjoy yoga & sometimes meditation, and I have a feeling that they would help a lot, but lately they keep falling into the \"not a good enough use of my time\" category. I feel like I used to have so much more time! It seems impossible that days are still 24 hours long. \n\nAny advice is much appreciated, PMs too. Thank you. I hope you are feeling fine <3 "

Two weeks ago, after almost a year trying to explain a seemingly unrelated medical problem, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune illness called Sjogren's Syndrome. \n\nSjogren's patients often have anxiety and depression for years before they are diagnosed (if they ever are, because many manifestations of the illness look just like common medical complaints). I have probably had it for 20 years, and no one knew.\n\nShocker to discover that I actually WAS sick and fatigued, that things actually WERE harder for me than others. \n\nI'm a week and a half into treatment for the autoimmune illness, and suddenly I feel energetic and well for much more of the day. The heart pounding anxiety has gone down, too. \n\nI'm still seeking treatment for the anxiety, of course, but now so much make sense. "

For example, today I haven't eaten anything, been lying in my bed since morning, and I loathe myself so, so much for it. I was supposed to write my CV today! And that task made me so anxious, I didn't do anything at all! This has been the case for a long time... I feel like I messed up major parts of my life, just because of this absurd feeling. Constantly nervous. Afraid to talk to people, afraid to make friends. Even now, as I'm writing this post, my hands are shaking, and I'm all sweaty thinking that this is going to be posted. I hate my appearance, my physique, everything. I don't have any interesting hobbies - tried to take up quite a few of them, but always quit after a few months. And I always think that I'm not good enough compared to my friends or my boyfriend. I'm not studying atm (quit uni earlier), I'm jobless (need to find a job desperately, but I'm failing spectacularly, can't even write a CV), my self confidence is non existant, and I just honestly don't know if it's worth living anymore. I'd kill myself if I had the guts. Thank you, anxiety, for making me too afraid to do that. \n\nI often wonder, how many people would come to my funeral?\n\nAnyways, anxiety is such a bitch. You just look at other people smiling, socializing, getting through their lives as every normal person can, but you are broken somehow, and you wonder, why can't you function as everyone else does?\n\nMy thoughts are scattered and all over the place. I'm not sure if this post is a rant, or a call for help, but what I actually want to say is hello. Hello everyone, who made through today and are still here. I'm proud of you, even if I can't be proud of myself."

Socially, we are very close-minded, we are anti-LGBT, anti-interfaith relationships. The government don't pursue high quality education for the citizens.

I know how it feels.\" and the look of releif on her face was priceless. We talked a little more and finally she was able to take my order and when I left we said goodbye and I said \"Take care, I hope it works out for you later\" \n\nWhen I left I felt so good, and I think she did too. I'm glad I opened my mouth and reached out to her because otherwise she might have started crying and that would have been even worse for her at work. \n\nAnd for anyone who might say \"if she's that sensitive maybe she shouldn't work at a stressful caf\u00e9\", no, even though someone works at a stressful job they do not deserve being left alone with an anxiety attack that might embarress them, and especially not at work in the middle of the city.

It is a celebration of what he meant to me and a celebration of all the therapist out there that are making a difference. \n\nMy therapist's name was Louis. When I met him, nearly 4 years ago, I was at a bad place in my life. I had been suffering from the effects of Anxiety Disorder for nearly 13 years, and visiting my GP monthly for over a year, when I asked her for a recommendation for a therapist. She gave me Louis' number and the number of 3 other therapists.\n\nAfter delaying for weeks, I called all of the referrals I was given. Two weren't taking new patients, one wasn't returning my calls and the 4th was Louis. What are the chances that I would like the only Therapist that would see me? (well, 100%)\n\nI was really nervous about meeting Louis because I had never been to therapy before. I had no idea what to expect. Would he judge me? Would he yell at me? Would he humiliate me? Would he intimidate me into taking action? I wasn't sure, but decided that I was willing to try.\n\nLouis was a short Jewish man that reminded me of the actor Saul Rubinek (Warehouse 13) with a trendier, gray, beard. He had a very soft way of communicating that made you feel instantly comfortable. After meeting him once, I knew that we were going to get along. Sometimes in life, you just click with people instantly. This is how it was with Louis and me. :)\n\nAs I went to each session, I discovered that Louis and I had tons in common: we experienced many of the same issues. So his recommendations felt tailored to me. In a way, talking to Louis was like talking to an older version of myself. We had different upbringings, I was raised Catholic and he was raised Jewish, but there we so many parallels between our lives that he would instantly be able to tell me his version of my story and how he dealt with it. This was the reinforcement I needed to prove to myself that everything was going to be okay. I was in good hands.\n\nDon't get me wrong, not every session in 4 years was pleasant. But every session was productive. He knew how to see past my BS. He knew how to get to the core of the issue. And the amazing thing was that the days that I thought I had nothing to talk about were the days that we made the most progress.\n\nBasically, when you don't think you have anything to talk about, it's usually because you have been trained to see past your BS. This means that you can actually start making some significant forward movements. \n\nNow, after 4 years of treatment. I am feeling fantastic and it is thanks to Louis. My goal when I started therapy was as follows:\n\nTo be myself without reservation, without shame, and without apology. \n\nLouis helped me to do these things by supporting the work I did as a vlogger. He helped me to talk publically about dealing with anxiety. He helped me to turn my weakness into a super power.\n\nNow...\n\nToday, while on a hike, I found out that Louis had passed away via the internet. I hadn't heard from him in few weeks and decided to give his office call. His message had been replaced with a referral service. I instantly typed \"Obituary Louis...\" and discovered that he had passed away 3 days ago, and I had just missed his funeral earlier in the day. \n\nThe feelings came rushing in, but there was no Anxiety. It was just a combination of sadness and joy. As I walked through the park, I cried and laughed - I must have looked like a crazy person. \n\nI cried because I lost a great friend. I laughed because I was full of joyful gratitude. He saved my life. And, to me, gratitude is displayed as laughter with tears.\n\nI decided that, while I missed his funeral, that I would place flowers at his office door. His office was right next door to a supermarket; so I ran in and got some flowers and a card. I quickly returned to my car and added the line... \"Louis was a blessing in my life.\"\n\nI exit my car and head towards the building only to be accosted by a parking attendant for the supermarket, \"You can't park here...\". I turn with flowers in hand, \"My friend is dead, I just want to show him some respect.\" \n\nWe argued a little and I told the attendant, in a frustrated tone, \"Fine! I will move my car!\" I could tell that he was kind of regretting telling me to move the car, due to the circumstances, but I just didn't have the time or energy.\n\nI ran up the stairs to Louis' office, placed the flowers and the card at the door, and returned to my car. All I could think of is that Louis would have wanted me to apologize to the parking attendant. \n\nI drove toward the attendant... He looked me in the eye as I approached. Probably thinking I was going to flip him off or something. But I channelled my friend and said, \"I want to apologize. I was a jerk to you. My friend died and I am a little upset. But he trained me to see when I am spreading my pain around. You were just doing your job.\" \n\nThe attendant told me, \"I am feeling really bad about this...\" I told him \"I am sorry for making you feel bad, but I am grateful to you because you have helped me to see that the lessons, that my friend taught me, will always be with me. \n\nLouis will always be with me, as my shoulder angel.\n\nThank you Louis. \nI love you! \ngodspeed my brother."

Nothing from nothing leaves nothing.\n\nSome would say that these fragile subjects are of no importance or that they were introduced to divide us. \"Look at what is it does to people!\", they say.

How will we know if we do not examine it?\n\nPeople fight all the time about nearly every subject.

In the car going home I start to get a really bad feeling, like i have a brain tumor or im having a stroke, this feeling escalares to a point where i just snap, i say to my mom \"please help me\", i feel the left side of my face to go heavy and numb, and i just go fucking crazy, i knew i was having a stroke for sure, i screamed a lot, and i said \"im going to die here\" my dad stops the car, i just scream \"hospital\", we get there, im not sure how im still alive, and long story short they gave me a pill to calm myself down, i get a brain scan that showed i had no problems at all.\n\nI am now at home, they prescribed me some pills and i am going to see a therapist, I hope this is the start of a new life for me, anxiety has been with me for a long time, and I finally had the courage to admit i have a problem, if you too live with this disease, please seek help. Im still recovering a bit from the panic attack, but now i know i have no problem, and that it cant kill me. \n\nThanks for reading this, stay strong.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all very much for you comments, i woke up today still feeling a bit anxious, but now i am feeling okay and it gives me hope that i can go through this :) We are all gonna make it, im sure of it"

A lot of people have asked questions about how I got over the anxiety, how I made myself take the test, etc. My biggest fear about driving was that I would confuse the gas and the brake. That did happen once, but I was able to correct it, and hasn't happened since. It very quickly becomes second nature.\n\nSecond, driving really isn't as scary as you think. Everyone on the road is a person, everyone makes mistakes driving, but you can quickly correct the mistakes. Its okay to make mistakes sometimes, just stay alert enough to notice and fix the mistake.\n\nThird, you just have to do it. I swear, your fear is worse than driving. I was absolutely terrified of driving, I just got home from my first time in the car by myself. It really is okay.  And driving is so freeing, I had no idea what I was missing out on. Please please please, just try it. "

When I had my first panic attack in high school I had no idea how to hide it. The first few months after my anxiety really kicked in I cried and freaked out in public, in class, at 2am with my mom, you name it. Eventually, I learned to sort of keep it under wraps, and I feel like it's been that way ever since.\n\n I've gone on to hold multiple stressful jobs, am currently doing well in a very rigorous grad school program, have plenty of friends, and have been in a great relationship for over 3 years, and all this time I feel like I have been able to mostly keep it hidden. While my anxiety definitely waxes and wanes, I feel like I never mention it to anyone unless it is to the point it is unbearable, and even then I just excuse myself and say I feel anxious without making a scene, or I make jokes about it.\n\nNow this has recently become a problem. With some additional stressors in my life I feel like my anxiety is coming back in full force and while I probably seem the same from the outside, I'm starting to have multiple panic attacks a day/ high levels of anxiety, while driving, hanging out with friends, in class etc. When I try to bring it up I feel like people don't believe me because I don't \"seem\" anxious. I probably look fine on the outside but I am having an absolute meltdown inside my head. \n\nAnyways not sure what the solution is to all this. Is it good to keep your anxiety under control outwardly even if it isn't the same inwardly? I certainly can't express every time I feel anxious, I would never get anything done and would probably be the biggest downer in the world to hang out with.  The other day I expressed to my gradschool counselor that my anxiety was getting really bad but he said I looked like everything was under control and my grades were great so why don't I just drink some tea, take a bath, and meditate. I wanted to scream, like oh all I have to do is take a bath and my TEN YEARS OF ANXIETY ARE CURED???? GEE THANKS! \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way???"

I met a guy at a party and we became \"bed buddies\" and we decided to keep our relationship to just that. Stupidly we didn't use protection, ever and had lots of unprotected sex for the first month of our bed buddy relationship. 4 weeks later I had a random one night stand with another guy. Me being fairly new to sex and him being very endowed did not go well together. I was to tight for him and it wasn't pleasurable in the least. It hurt and eventually we gave up, and he never ejaculated. We used a condom. Then an hour or so later tried again, condom free this time but same story. It hurt, I was dry, he never finished. That was the end of it and I never seen him again. \n\nI was due to start my period the next day or 2. 2 days later (the day I was supposed to start) I had my regular unprotected sex with my BB. But my period never came and I knew immediately I was pregnant. My periods were extremely regular so when I was a week late I went to the doctor and got a blood test. It was barely positive so I had either just conceived or was miscarrying. 3 weeks later I got an ultrasound that confirmed I was 6 weeks pregnant. I counted back 6 weeks and it was 2 weeks prior to my one night stand so I thought I was in the clear. I told BB I was pregnant, he accepted it, we continued our weird relationship. He continued to be young and dumb and when I was 6 months pregnant he went to jail for 90 days. A week before I had my child I found out they add 2 weeks to your due date, this meant that I in fact conceived right in the middle of the questionable time. To say I panicked is an understatement. I was 18, terrified, my boyfriend was in jail, all of our families knew and I didn't know what to do. I wish I had just been honest and it's one of my biggest regrets today, but I was young and scared. I thought I should be able to tell who the dad is by looks, but that wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. \n\n2 years later we had another kid and during one of my obsessive panics (that I have all the damn time and are eating me alive) I found one night stand on MySpace. In a panic I messaged him and told him I did conceive around our encounter and it's possible he is the dad (he knew I was pregnant when it happened but I told him the dates were 2 weeks off so it wasn't his). He told me that my kid looks nothing like him, I'm crazy, and to never contact him again. \n\nMy child is child 9 now and I'm still not sure who the dad is. Sometimes I think looks like my hubby and sometimes I think looks like one night stand (even though I haven't seen a picture of this guy in 7 years and probably couldn't point him out in a lineup).\n\nThis is driving me insane. I'm constantly comparing pictures. I'm sick over it daily. I'm terrified to find out my child isn't my hubbys. It's not likely I got pregnant by the one night stand for one the dates do but add up with my period at all, and he never did finish, but I know that it's still possible and the fact that really doesn't look like my hubby yet our other kid is his twin makes me want to throw up. \n\nMy kid adores dad. I know it would be traumatizing and extremely painful to both of them to find out he isn't the dad. This other guy has never tried to contact me even though he knows there's a chance and despite my very best efforts to find him (to compare pictures) he is no where on the internet. A part of me says what's done is done. I don't want to hurt either of them and my child is already half way raised. The other part of me says that they, and I deserve to know the truth and that it will probably come out eventually. I'm also worrying myself sick over something that may not even be true. But if I knew for sure that hubby wasn't the dad I don't think I could hide it, I would have to tell him. \n\nI'm scared and I don't know what to do, but 10 years of worrying myself sick is taking it's toll on me too. I just want to know the truth but I don't want to hurt anyone especially the people I love most. \n\nIf one night stand is the dad I don't even know how to contact him, if he would want to be a part of my child's life, or what kind of person he is. \n\nNot really relevant but throwing it in there, hubby was pretty terrible for the first 7 years we were together. He was an alcoholic, a compulsive liar, incredibly irresponsible, and cheated on me repeatedly. Despite all of this I've been nothing but faithful and honest with him about everything else our entire relationship, I also think this is part of the reason I dealt with his crap for so long. Needless to say he has done a complete 180 and has been really good the past 3ish years. \n\nIf you've read this far, thank you and I'll take any advice or opinions I can get! I wish I could get this out of my head but I'm not a liar or a secret keeper. I also have a little OCD so I will obsess on it in my head for days and I'm just really really sick of living this way."

I understand that the whole concept of introvert vs extrovert isn't black and white, but what can I learn from this? \n\nEdit: thanks for the responses. A lot of people are saying things like \"well yeah that just sounds like social anxiety\", or \"you're more comfortable around your friends so obviously you'll be more yourself\" but that's not what I'm getting at. I don't just become a \"normal\" member of the conversation when I'm comfortable - rather I tend to dominate it. I enjoy it a *lot*. So I'm wondering if the repressing of my own thoughts and words in uncomfortable situations is sort of causing this buildup of social energy which then gets released when I'm comfortable."

We were talking all the past week and we thought it would be a good idea to go out and have a drink. I was very nervous. \n\nI remember that before I went out, I had a shower, brushed my teeth, used mouthwash and I arrived 20 minutes before the proposed time. When she arrived, the anxiety attacked me and I did not know how to start the conversation, so I forced myself and said a couple of stupid sentences. I thought there was no way to go back. However, when she realized that I was shy, she started to bring up topics of conversation and took me to a bar.\n\n I remember that I decided to sit in front of her instead of beside her because of my shyness. I have never liked alcohol, but I thought that ordering a beer would be the best to disinhibit me. I asked her some questions I prepared before going out. But, like many of you, I was not able to have a long conversation. \n\nSometimes there was a serie of silences that bothered me a lot, but the girl always encouraged me and said that she thought that shy people are much more interesting than extroverted. That made me happy and suddenly she began to hold my hand. My confidence increased a lot in that moment. Realizing that not all women like extroverted men made made feel great, which caused me to feel much more comfortable and I started to talk a bit more. She was liking what I was saying and suddenly she kissed me on the mouth. At that moment I was happy again. All I needed was this. Feeling the affection of a woman. \n\nA few hours later we left the bar and she asked me if I would like to sleep with her. I became very nervous again because I was still a virgin (I am 20 years old). I decided to tell this to the girl and she said that nothing was wrong. She even thought that it was was cute! Then I challenged myself and my anxiety and accepted the plan. I was going to sleep for the first time in my life with a girl. When we arrived to the hostel, she took me to the bed and started to hug me. After it, she took off her clothes. I was nervous but I tried to get carried away by the situation. Then, we finally had sex. I lost my virginity. Afterwards, we went to bed together, embracing each other and, without a doubt, it was one of the most beautiful moments of my life.\n \nI tell you this to give you courage. If you leave the comfort zone, you can get almost anything. I'm serious. Before this, I was depressed and even obsessed with E.R. However, having fought against my anxiety has healed my mind.\nCheer up. Changing your situation is possible\n\nEdit: \nFunny fact: She compared shy or serious people with some of the best movie characters of all time. She said that our seriousness is what make us really attractive. Look at Darth Vader for example. He is serious, doesn't talk too much, he hides his feelings, but everyone loves him.\n\nDo not change your personality, there are girls out who will appreciate your personality."

Everything I tried on worsened my anxiety. There is not a single outfit I can put on that makes me look like an adult...like a woman...like a professional. Even if I wanted to look \"business casual\", I don't think I could pull it off. I look at myself in the mirror and see a child attempting to blend in with adults. I look silly with bangs. I look silly without bangs. My hair won't stay up. My hair can't be down. Why did no one ever teach me how to do my hair? My face is too round. I am only five feet tall. Heels look ridiculous on me. I feel like a joke in a cardigan. I don't even wear padded bras. I'm frumpy...not in a good way. I see girls who look frumpy in a good way, and I wonder why I can't. I'm the wrong kind of grunge. I can't pull any style off, so I oscillate between different styles hoping something clicks. Everyone makes it look so easy. How did you get your hair to DO that? Does it ever hang in front of your face like a set of heavy curtains? How do you look so good in exercise clothes? How did you get your shirt to tuck in your shorts like that? Is all my acne showing? Is my make-up caked on? Is it obvious that I am a child in a woman's body? \n\nWhy do I bully myself so much? Why do I not listen to my partner when they tell me I am beautiful? Or sexy? Or that my hair has never looked better?\n\nWill I ever feel like my appearance is intentional and put together? Will I ever accept that my face is permanent? \n\nThanks for listening. Tomorrow will probably be a better day."

            "value": "I've been submitting and contributing to this subreddit for a few weeks now, and I've come across a good handful of people who experience panic attacks like mine: with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and even a low-grade fever. Let's get through this together, guys and gals:\n\nIt isn't food poisoning. Food poisoning sets in within the first 30 minutes of eating contaminated food. You aren't sick. It's not e.coli. It's not salmonella. Your brain just wants to pretend it is.\n\nFever below 101F? Nauseous? Feeling some tummy trouble? Vomiting resulting from an infection isn't something you can hold back. There isn't a slow buildup of nausea until you start retching. If you have the flu, it's gonna come out fast. Unless you taste sulfur (like rotten eggs) when you burp a little, you aren't going to throw up. If you DO throw up anyway, it's your brain deceiving you into exhibiting the symptoms of the thing you're afraid of. You're okay. Even if you're still being sick, you WILL be okay. It WILL go away. It's okay if you can't help it. You aren't weak for succumbing. You haven't failed. It's just bad, rampant hormones. It will go away.\n\nBaby yourself through this. Treat yourself well. Listen to your instincts about what you need to get through this. Want to camp out in your bathtub so the toilet is right nearby? Grab yourself some pillows, blankets, water, saltines, and your phone or computer. Camp out. Even if it's in a funny place like your bathtub or your hall closet - if you feel safe there, go there. It WILL help.\n\nBreathing exercises work for some, but not for everyone. \"Happy thoughts\" work for some, but not for everyone. If you find that deep, cleansing breaths and picturing daisies swaying in the springtime breeze doesn't do a damned thing for you, that doesn't mean it's not a panic attack. It just mean your disorder has an extra-tough candy coating of \"fuck you\". There are other ways to get through it. You'll figure them out in time. Until that time comes, focus on positioning yourself so you at least feel in control of your environment. Nest. Stay hydrated. Take an antacid - it will help with the reflux. If you've got diarrhea, take an imodium (half a pill to start with - follow the directions on the bottle) or some pepto bismol (pink bismuth)(Do NOT take a separate antacid and imodium alongside pepto. It's one or the others). The chemistry and pH in your digestive system is thrown off by your panic. That's why you feel sick.\n\nNow, let's get some white noise going. Some people find comfort in music. Some don't. I, personally, find a lot of comfort in writing to you guys and watching comforting tv shows. Here are some links, all of which are free and available for streaming (make sure your adblock is on. These sources have been very good about limiting any phishy stuff, but better safe than sorry):\n\n[Mythbusters](http://watch-series-tv.to/serie/mythbusters)\n\n[Good Eats](http://watch-series-tv.to/serie/good_eats)\n\n[Bill Nye, the Science Guy](http://watch-series-tv.to/serie/bill_nye%3A_the_science_guy)\n\n[Planet Earth](http://watch-series-tv.to/serie/planet_earth)\n\n[Walking With Beasts](http://watch-series-tv.to/serie/Walking_with_Beasts)\n\n[Hidden Kingdoms](http://watch-series-tv.to/serie/hidden_kingdoms)\n\n[Holmes on Homes](http://watch-series-tv.to/serie/holmes_on_homes)\n\n[The Magic School Bus](http://watch-series-tv.to/serie/the_magic_school_bus)\n\nI find the above shows really comforting because, not only are they light in plot content, but they're educational and engaging. When you're engaging the learning center of your brain, it can help distract you from feeling sick and panicky. That same website has a ton of available shows to watch - take a look around and look for whatever you like :) \n\nAnother, more obscure, site that I sometimes use [plays the Animal Crossing hourly music in real-time according to your timezone](http://tane.us/ac/)\n\nYou're gonna get through this. It's nothing more than misfires in your brain causing a big, fat release of stress hormones. Those stress hormones can not only cause hyperventilation and feelings of impending doom, but it can also pretend to be the flu or food poisoning. It's neither of those things.\n\nTreat yourself like your ideal, doting momma would. Picture the ultimate comforting figure. What would they do for you if you were this sick? Would they build you a pillow fort? Bring you water and your favorite stuffed animal? Your baby blanket? If you cowered in the bathtub for 4 hours straight, would they give you blankets, pillows, and put on The Magic Schoolbus? Do it. I don't care if it's emasculating. I don't care if it seems childish. In times like these, babying ourselves can be the best medicine.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, it's absolutely, 100% okay to feel this sick. This panic disorder is just that: A disorder. When epileptics have seizures, we don't shame them for it. When a person with Crohn's Disease has a flare-up, we don't shame them for it. Just like with autoimmune diseases, just like with epilepsy, just like with any other chronic disorder, we can't control our symptoms. We can't control when they're going to hit us. Medication and therapy can help, yes, but FORGIVING ourselves can also help. Letting ourselves just be sick, just be anxious, and just be panicky without trying to power through it is okay. You're not weak for needing to do that. You're just letting this ugly little bout take its course. Sometimes, leaning back, hunkering down, and waiting for the storm to pass is the kindest thing you can do for yourself, and can be the fastest way out of it. You're gonna get through this.\n\n**tl;dr:** Treat yo self. You'll be alright. You're awesome, guys; no matter how crappy (sometimes literally) you may feel right now. It'll go away, and this subreddit is gonna be here whenever you need it.\n\nedit: formatting"

I\u2019ve come to fully expect to fail and be horrible at anything I do, and I feel like whatever people I meet along the way secretly hate me. This always seems to happen to me when I get really into something and get excited which is almost like a grace period, but then... it just crashes.\n\nFor instance, I just got into Dungeons and Dragons. It\u2019s been.... a month or so? And I\u2019m already wanting to quit after participating in four games because I feel like my character and abilities are awful and that the people I\u2019m playing with are only doing it because they feel obligated.\n\nI\u2019m fully aware that a lot of this is in my head, but as much as I try to rationalize it, I always find myself cutting it off and choosing to participate in activities that only require me, myself, and I.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be that old person who has literally nobody in their life and nothing to live for. I want so bad to push through it, but I just.... can\u2019t?\n\nCan anyone give me some advice as to how to better manage myself with this? I want to better myself as a person.\n\nAlso, I have a job that requires me to be friendly, well speaking and everything, and my problems there are far less severe. I still feel like I suck at it, but I\u2019m sure as hell great at acting in the moment."

For as long as I could remember, I slept in my mom's bed with her. I couldn't explain why, I just could not face sleeping in my room alone. I hardly ever had any friends over (Back when I actually had friends) for the night, because I knew that if I ended up in my mom's bed, there would be a lot of questions. \n\nEven when my sister had friends over, I stayed awake until they fell asleep, so I could sneak off to my mom's room. \n\nBecause of the small bed size, and because my younger brother also sleeps in the bed (For other complicated reasons), I rarely got a good nights sleep. \n\nOccasionally, I have attempted to sleep on my own, but couldn't do it. During the day, I tell myself that I want to sleep on my own. I get so close, until the night comes. Every time, I found that I couldn't do it. Something would come up, or something would scare me into crawling back to my mom's room. \n\nThere were times when I was younger, that my little brothers father would try to force me to sleep in my own bed. He would tease me, or laugh at me. Because of this, I would lay awake in my bed until I was sure that he was asleep, so that I could creep silently in next to my mom. He often slept on the floor in the living room. \n\nFinally, last night, I decided that enough was enough. I will be a high school senior in just a few weeks. It was time that I grow up and face one of my fears. I hooked my ipod up to a speaker, and set in to play some of my favorite songs on a low volume. \n\nAs lights in the house went out, I got a little bit nervous. Could I really do this? I tossed and turned for half an hour, trying to clear my fears out of my head. There were quiet a few times that I almost gave up. A big one was when I had to get out of the bed and throw the light on after finding a thumb tack stuck under the sheets. It would have been so much easier to throw the light off and run to my mom's room. But something inside knew that I could do it. \n\nI clicked off the light and padded back to my bed, settling in once again. It took a while, but I guess that eventually I fell asleep because the next thing I knew, my alarm was going off on my iPod. It was morning! I had finally, after so many years, slept in my bed through the night. I even turned off the alarm and slept for another hour! \n\nTonight will be my second attempt, and hopefully it will stick! \n\nTL;DR: After 17 years of embarrassment and ridicule, I finally got through a night in my own bed alone.\n\nEdit: thanks so much for the support and good luck! I almost didn't post this, but now I'm so glad that I did :) if I had cash you all would be swimming in Reddit gold. Instead, have some Internet hugs! \\(\u2022 \u2022)/  "

I am in a comfy place, I have my own office with a door and a window that has lots of natural light. I get to be creative in my job and I have many many tasks I'm responsible for, but my job isn't so critical that I can't take a slow day when I need it.\n\nOne of the big things that is great about here is the people... I have such a good connection with the people here. They are all so friendly, I laugh at work, I can make jokes with them, I can say what I need to say, I don't have to (but still do...) rehearse conversations in my head.\n\nToday my boss and I were talking about the winter and how it gets really gloomy here (the area we live in is notoriously rainy and completely grey for 4 months of the year). I mentioned I might get a SAD lamp for my desk, and he asked if I am affected my the weather in the winter and I just decided I would say it and be casual about it. I said \"well, I don't think I've told you this but I have anxiety and I find the sunlight makes it better, so having one of those would be good in the winter months.\"\n\nYou know what he said? \"This place will cure you of your anxiety, we're a bunch of wackadoodles.\" And I talked a bit about how my old job really exasperated my anxiety because I was alone all the time and he said that \"this is a way better place for you.\"\n\nI have never felt so accepted and just simply cared about in one sentence. He didn't make a fuss of it, he didn't make a face, he just carried on my casual tone and took it in and let it go. Now he knows and now I know he knows and that stress is just off my shoulders.\n\nI just wanted to let you guys know that there is hope out there for us. You can find a job where you'll be accepted for who you are. Yes, I still have days where I have 99 problems and 97 of them are completely made up, but being in a job that makes me happy has changed my life. I was on the verge of a major breakdown last year at this time, and it took me until Christmas to find the guys to apply for a new job and until February to get into one, but boy am I ever happy I went out of my way to do something that was better for my life.\n\nAnxiety has it's ways of convincing us that we are where we are supposed to be an we deserve that treatment or that job or that horrible boss but we don't. I would be so happy if this post encouraged anyone to even just think twice about where they are and think that maybe they should take a look at what else is out there.\n\nThanks for all the support over the past couple years, this community is a wonderful place.\n\nEdit: Wow, I didn't expect this to get this much attention, thanks to all who upvoted and those who commented. I really just came here to share that I was pleased with his reaction and I somehow expected it would turn out to be negative or something. Anyway, thank you, I truly do have a GG boss. He's a really kind man and I am so lucky to be where I am now.\n\nIt was this sub that pushed me to look for a new job in the first place so I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for all of us wackadoodles. :)"

I did go to work with the butcher last night, and as you can see from me typing this out I am alive! Everything went really well and I think I can learn a lot from him. This is exactly what I was talking about. What I was experiencing *felt* like a gut feeling, but it was just anxiety. I don't get actual gut feelings often enough to know the difference. "

Makes me feel ashamed for reaching out. Some people I told about my anxiety issues got excited saying that made me super good at organizing things and I always seemed to know where I was going because of this, but the only reason really is that I can never make a move, even a simple social outing, if I don't know who's there, where it is, when is it over, how do I get back, what will happen. I can rarely go to anything because most people don't get it, they think I'm annoying even, to be asking how things will go, saying I should relax and go with the flow. I can't do that!\n\nI hate this glorification! Being anxious does not make me more organized, it makes me petrified! It does not help me at all! It's not \"cool\" or \"edgy\" to be anxious, it's sometimes (most times) a horrible handicap. It does not make me an eventual better wife, it just sucks in a romantic relationship, second guessing every tone change, every wording, every glance and fearing I am not enough or too much, fearing I'm pushing people away but wishing with all my being I could do that because it would mean not having to calculate when I have to call them/give a sign I'm still alive and interested in their life, because I am... but I suck at keeping touch.\n\nBeing told my anxiety is only in my head and I should snap out of it, it hurts. It hurts because it affects me physically too and it's showing, and people don't get that being unable to have energy, being unable to sleep, being unable to enjoy any physical contact are side effects of me hurting so much \"only in my head\" It hurts so much and I wish I could switch it off, forget about it! It's like people confuses stress with anxiety. And I still haven't been to a doctor because I can't even dare to step into my school's nurse office, I run away. My best friend struggles with anxiety too and how come I can motivate her to reach out and support her, but can't take my own advices?\n\nI've tried talking to my famiy about my anxiety issues and I was told I wasn't special and it was normal at my age, that I would grow out of it. I wouldn't dare to talk about it to the family members who would understand, because I feel like such a burden to everyone.\n\nThis is late night ramblings, I've been feeling down and empty recently and so angry at everything at the same time. \n\nI'm sorry. It's simply annoying to have to explain every day that I am anxious and don't know why, and no I can't help biting my nails or tapping my foot, it just happens while I'm so deep into my own head that I get lost in all the things I should be thinking about but can't in fear of having a full panic attack. It's difficult to make people who don't even know what anxiety feels like understand. It's difficult to make people who think they know understand. \n\nMany things going on at the same time, many responsibilities, many changes, and so little focus and composure to accomplish any of it...\n\nWhile people with anxiety can be the most precious and kind and loving individuals in the world, anxiety is not pretty, it's not a likeable trait one should actively seek to develop or find in a partner. Anxiety is something people accept about others. Those who seek anxiety in a partner are likely to look for someone unstable to save or destroy, or both.\n\nDon't like me because I'm anxious, like me because even if I'm anxious, I came to see you, support you and care for you, as friends, family and loved ones should do. \n\nIf only they would stop wearing anxiety like a fashion statement, and thus help the misunderstanding around it die!\n\nI see so many people on this sub struggle and I just want to say that you all are so awesome and strong. My problems are not as dire as yours, I see some of you trying so hard and it inspires me, but it also makes me so angry at the people who just want to look different and edgy and make you all look like your struggles are nothing but a cheap attempt to get attention. \n\nI'll stop now because this is getting more and more incoherent... Again, late night ramblings.... Sorry.\n\nEdit: Wow, thank you for my first gold, kind stranger!"

It\u2019s this guy named \u201cScoots\u201d and he does these long rambling podcasts about things that are semi-interesting enough to stop you from thinking about your problems but boring enough that they are soothing and can help you fall asleep or just zone out into a really comforting place.\n\nSome of my favorites is he will sometimes read the whole Trader Joe\u2019s flyer, or he\u2019ll read a TV guide from the 1990s, or he will make up silly stories. It\u2019s the kind of stuff that really takes your attention away from anxiety -and because Scoots is so funny and talks in a slow, soothing voice it makes it the perfect package. He also makes it a point not to use triggering words and themes.\n\nThis podcast has helped me so hugely that I even give some money to it every month via Patreon because I don\u2019t know how I would live without it. Sometimes if I feel anxiety creeping up during the day, I will just line up a bunch of SWM episodes to play in the background. I\u2019m on their Facebook group and I always see people with PTSD and anxiety talking about how it has been a lifechanger for them too. \n\nThe episodes are this mixture of both soothing, funny, and nostalgic in a way that I\u2019ve never experienced before. And if you have sleep problems, it\u2019s so lulling that I find  I always fall asleep like 10 minutes in if I\u2019m really tired. \u201cScoots\u201d developed this way of speaking that is kind of meandering and drawn out, but for some reason it really helps with anxiety.\n\nHopefully this well help someone who decides to give it a try like I did! If any of you do try it, my fave recent episodes are \u201cPeeping Leaves\u201d (Where he rambles about all the colors of autumn leaves) and \u201cCostume Nostalgia\u201d (Where he talks about shopping for Halloween costumes as a kid).

I enjoyed reading them. But when the clock strikes to 10, all those good times come to an end, and all those novels I read come back to haunt me. Even though I do not fear such as monster or boogey-mans, the darkness itself feels sinister to me. Every night its the same; I try and sleep, my mind drifting to an early stage of sleep. But then I hear a movement. I do not have a clock in my room, or any TVs. At 10, my family are already asleep. So the fact that I am awake alone gives me the creeps. And the silence. I hate the silence. As if I am waiting for something to pop up and: \"SCREEEEE\" on my face. I always sleep with my little brother. But he is a heavy sleeper. As I lie there, I keep hearing the movements. They come in my room when everyone except me is asleep. The sounds are similar to dragging your feet across the rug. They come in here, stays a bit and goes to my dads room, then my mom and my little sisters room. It is impossible for me to stand up and check the rooms, as it isn't because of my nerves, it is that when I move, the noises become sinister. As if they are actually a real existing creature that senses movements and sounds. I feel better not to tell my parents about it, as I know that the noises will come back no matter what. Even when I do finally sleep, I wake up with no dang reason and just... stay awake. As I wonder why I woke up, the silence just kills me. I am sometimes even happy when I hear dad snoring. I often dream about me in the woods, in complete darkness, with strange things following me. I usually turn on my desk lamp. But mom often comes in at night and turns it off. Or... if it is mom. I tried filming it on my laptop, but, as I expected, I see nothing. Maybe it is my imagination. But the sounds were real beyond my imagination. Am I going nuts? I don't play computer that much. I usually play basketball. My mother always told me that my ancestors were Mongolian Shamans, and they chose me as the next one. My mother and I once went to a psychologist and she told me that most shamans experience this at early ages of 8-14. She also said that I needed to overcome my fear. Or that the spirits I call will be the ones that haunted me. Of course, I don't want that to happen. So, any suggestions?"

I was bored, so I started taking random selfies, as one does when they\u2019re bored at 2am and have a Snapchat. I noticed in one of my pictures that I had a *large* bruise on my chin. I did not have this bruise when I went to sleep. I\u2019ve woken up with bruises before, but failed to tell anyone because of their concerning placements. Sometimes they\u2019d be on my inner thighs, and others, they\u2019d appear on my wrists, which I couldn\u2019t tell anyone about because I was worried people would think that I had relapsed (I have a history of self harming). I figured it would\u2019ve looked suspicious if I told people I had \u2018suddenly woken up with bruises that coincidentally happened to be where I used to self harm\u2019, and in my opinion that\u2019s not very believable. \n\n   Sometime during that same week, I went to the bathroom as anyone normally would. I\u2019m the kind of person who routinely checks myself and looks down at whatever it is is in the toilet just to make sure I haven\u2019t crapped out a baby or something completely insane like that. This time, I happened to look down, and I saw a small, dull green object floating in the water. Everything else had sunk, and I was fucking confused and concerned, so without thinking I removed the object from the water -gross, yes- , placed it on a sheet of toilet paper, and put it on my bathroom counter to observe it. I rinsed it off in my sink and started to look at it, and I noticed it looked a lot like a capsule pill. I held it closer to my face so that I could get a better look at whatever had just come out of my body and it SMELLED. Granted, this was something that had just come out of the same place from which I defecated. It was hard, like a pill, and it had a small hole in one end of it. There seemed to be something coming out of it, which was also green, so I squeezed it, out of pure curiosity. Out came a green slime-like... liquid? No, it was slime. Or goo. I have no idea. It smelled. When I squeezed the entire thing, the \u2018pill\u2019 began to flatten out and become clear. It was almost like plastic. The only thing I can think of it being is a capsule pill, because what on earth else could it be? I threw the thing away, and  made a mental note to keep an eye out for any more of them. \n\n   Sure enough, today I went to the bathroom, and found two of them. The exact same shape, smell, color, everything was identical. \n\nI searched online for what it could be, but I couldn\u2019t find any answers, other than the fact that it could be an undigested pill but \n\n***I DO NOT TAKE GREEN PILLS.***\n\nI take ambien, which is a light orange, and not a capsule, and conserta for my ADD, which is round and not green, nor is it a capsule. \n\nI don\u2019t know if anything like this has happened to anyone else, especially finding random WHOLE pills in feces, but if you have ANY idea what this could be, please let me know, because I\u2019m actually really confused/scared, and I have no clue what is going on with me. \n\nThank you for reading, if you did, and I\u2019m sorry this was so long.

I\u2019m extremely lucky to have even gotten it since we aren\u2019t rich and don\u2019t have a lot of money.. I had a job but me and my stupid stress and anxiety had to quit my first job after two whole days because I couldn\u2019t handle it.. I wanted to keep the job so badly... I failed.. \n\nAnd today I got to buy concert tickets to some of my favorite dj\u2019s and artists. I\u2019ve never been to a concert before and I\u2019m extremely excited for it. \n\nAnyways back to the point of this post.. \nDoes anyone else get nervous and extremely anxious when good things happen? I\u2019m scared now that something bad is going to happen or that something will go wrong..  :( I\u2019m really scared and I don\u2019t know why or what to do. I hate feeling like this. \n\nThank you so much if you\u2019ve read all of this. It means a lot and even helps venting about this.\n\n\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m so sorry I can\u2019t reply to all of you right now. I will be replying to as many as I can! Thank you all so much! I\u2019m just also worried that this concert I bought tickets to, will end up being 18+ even though I\u2019ve looked everywhere trying to find out. The website does say all ages but I\u2019m just really scared because every time someone I really like and want to see comes anywhere close to me, (I live in the middle of nowhere in south Texas. The closest Walmart is an hour away), it\u2019s always 18+ .. \n\nHas anyone ever heard of Breakaway Dallas? It\u2019s a music festival.. or here is the website as well - [Breakaway Music Festival](breakawaydallas.com) \nCan anyone help me out with this? It would be a huge relief or I\u2019ll be stressing out until April 7th.. \n\nThank you all again. You\u2019re amazing people here.\n\nEDIT #2 : not sure if this is even allowed here, but if anyone has twitter or Snapchat or even pm here, and doesn\u2019t mind talking to me every once and a while, it would mean the world to me. Having someone to talk to that understands helps a ton. Yet none of my friends even understand and just laugh at me.. if you can talk to me, or want to, pm me? Thanks again. You\u2019re the best. *huge group hug* "

I leave in an hour and I am really terrified. The hardest part now is going and starting. Learning everything, meeting people and I admit, I'm afraid I'm too out of shape and will not do my best. Four years is a long time to stay in my home worrying about the outside world. I gained weight and didn't take care of myself. But if you all can promise to try to do your best then I can promise I'll try my best today as well.

I have a stable, decent job; I have a family that loves me, I have some good friends (even if none of them still live in the same state as me), I'm about to be able to afford my own place. But I can't see the pure good in that because my rose colored glasses are fringed with the pure black of mental illness. The last few weeks have actually been really good; I've been getting out more and reaching out trying to make more friends locally. But a flashback, plus a depressive episode and now a panic attack all within a few days makes everything good seem so far away. I hate that this happens. I hate that I have to rely on mind altering substances just so I can maintain the mask of a well-adjusted person. Worst of all I hate that I feel like I have no one me near me that would truly understand if I opened up about any of this. And I'm also tired of being quiet about it, and I needed to vent.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the responses; I felt a lot better after I wrote all this out and it means a lot to know that there is a community out there that gets it, and that I can reach out to."

I don't mean to sound absolute with some of my statements, it's just in relation to the hole I was in.\n\nI smoked weed for 7 years (started at 16), daily for 6. I slowly started drinking more and more alongside it until it was 4-5 beers and 2 grams of weed daily.\n\nI've had anxiety since about 12. Bad depression, suicidal thinking, isolation gradually got worse from 18. By 22 (last year), life was so shit. It was unbarable. Over the 3 years before I'd had failed relationships, unemployment, family problems, intense isolation (weed and drinks on my own in a little shed watching videos off my phone - 8 hours a day sometimes).\n\nI'm a prime example of using my anxiety as an excuse to abuse substances and avoid social situations and self improvement. I could have convinced you back then that I'm all good, just sorting through things. I have remarkable people skills when I apply them (did sales for 2 years), but I wasn't interested in anything other than getting fucked up and living in a realty where \"this is my life for now . . .\".\n\n\nAlmost decided to live in my car, live with a crack head, travel the country (aka: begin my homeless life, cause I really had no money and if I did it would've gone to beer). I was losing my mind.\n\nAfter being heavily suicidal for a week I decided I can't live like this anymore - but I don't want to die right now.\n\nI planted a thought in my head. 'if you ever want to overcome this, you need to begin to change'. I envisioned the person I wanted to be; even if I wasn't unequipped to be so at the time.\n\n**It took me one year** of very gradual changes to get to where I am now. One week sober. I closed up the shed, changed from bongs to joints and sat outside my house on a chair. The joints got bigger and bigger but a least I was only drinking 2-3 beers a day. \n\nI implemented hobbies back into my life. Didn't spend a lot of time on them, but just 5-10 mins was a start. I joined a gym, some weeks I went once or twice, sometime I didn't go for a month. I reached out to old friends, sometime we didn't catch up until a couple weeks, sometimes we were both busy at different times, but I saw peoples faces and her their voices - after too long of seeing the same-old and only connecting with people through weed or alcohol (or other).\n\nHad to work so hard to **prepare myself** to change my ways. It didn't take weeks or months. It took a whole year - 52 weeks of ups and downs, but a commitment to improving myself. It was difficult. It didn't feel like anything was different mentally until toward the end. I saw psych's, drs, counselors and was so optimistic they would help me change myself until I realized I already knew what to do. I decided I can channel all my anxiety into self improvement.\n\nBought a huge whiteboard, and everyday woke up I had these chores to do. Idea's, reminders, quotes. Things just kept coming to mind. Things to fix/buy/take for a walk/hobbies to look into. I was still a depressed, anxious, alcoholic-stoner - but instead of watching tv, playing games, watching life slip away - I felt like I was on to something.\n\nI never expected the benefits from cutting down and quitting. Every department of my life is better. I had to force change. It took me a year because change made me more anxious.  **I've been sober for a week and the change is awesome!** I laugh, I stay active, I speak clearly, I look people in the eye, I get things done as I want to get them done - immediately. Living a different reality.\n\nIf anyone here is being controlled by these substances I just want to remind you that they are holding you back. These coping mechanisms are making you doubt yourself and not allowing you to progress - not allowing you to know yourself without them.\n \n\nI've heard every excuse in the book against self-improvement. Don't gratify your situation. Don't gratify your anxiety. It's a little runt that wants you to believe you can't change and will never be happy enough anyway. Lower your pride to allow for change. Take control of your life. Learn to love yourself again (you deserve to).   Life will welcome you back with open arms."

I\u2019m supposed to label them whenever I catch myself doing one in real life (ex: I just used emotional reasoning). He says that putting a label to it will help you to distinguish between what is a cognitive distortion (read: your anxiety) and what is rational/legitimate. It keeps you from letting your anxiety take over your thinking. \n\nI was surprised about how many of these I do! I do pretty much all of them. I do \u201cblaming\u201d the least, but I catch myself doing using these cognitive distortions countless times every day. \n\nWhich ones do you do? Try to hold yourself accountable! Put a name to your anxiety, so that you can help control it! :)\nHere\u2019s the list:\n\n1.\t**Mind Reading**. You assume that you know what people think without sufficient evidence of their thoughts. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m a loser.\u201d\n2.\t**Fortune-telling**. You predict the future negatively: things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. \u201cI\u2019ll fail that exam\u201d or \u201cI won\u2019t get the job.\u201d\n3.\t**Catastrophizing**. You believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you won\u2019t be able to stand it. \u201cIt would be terrible if I failed.\u201d\n4.\t**Labeling**. You assign global negative traits to yourself and others. \u201cI\u2019m undesirable,\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019s a rotten person.\u201d\n5.\t**Discounting positives**. You claim that the positive things you or others do are trivial. \u201cThat\u2019s what wives are supposed to do- so it doesn\u2019t count when she\u2019s nice to me,\u201d or \u201cThose successes were easy, so they don\u2019t matter.\u201d\n6.\t**Negative filtering**. You focus almost exclusively on the negatives and seldom notice the positives. \u201cLook at all of the people who don\u2019t like me.\u201d\n7.\t**Overgeneralizing**. You perceive a global pattern of negatives on the basis of a single incident. \u201cThis generally happens a lot to me. I seem to fail at a lot of things.\u201d\n8.\t**Dichotomous thinking**. You view events or people in all-or-nothing terms. \u201cI get rejected by everyone,\u201d or \u201cIt was a complete waste of time.\u201d\n9.\t**Blaming**. You focus on the other person as the source of your negative feelings, and you refuse to take responsibility for changing yourself. \u201cShe\u2019s to blame for the way I feel now,\u201d or \u201cMy parents caused all of my problems.\u201d\n10.\t**What if?** You keep asking a series of questions about \u201cwhat if\u201d something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. \u201cYeah, but what if I get anxious?,\u201d or \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t catch my breath?\u201d\n11.\t**Emotional Reasoning**. You let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. \u201cI feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.\u201d\n12.\t**Inability to disconfirm**. You reject any evidence that might contradict your negative thoughts. For example, when you have the thought *I\u2019m unlovable*, you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. Consequently, your thoughts cannot be refuted. \u201cThat\u2019s not the real issue. There are deeper problems. There are other factors.\u201d\n\n\nEDIT: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_restructuring\n\nHere's a useful wikipedia article on how to deal with conquering these distortions, thanks to /u/1210MK2!"

Another night, we woke up and found our door rammed in as if someone tried to break in. (Posted pic) and a few days later the same thing happened again around midnight, two gangster looking guys dressed in all black, hoods on so couldnt see their face, knocked on our door and they looked super suspicious.  Once they heard my cat make noise they walked away quickly. Then we saw them circling around the apt building and saw another guy on a bike. My bf went downstairs and noticed the neighbor going back inside and he told my bf that those guys knocked on his door too looking for someone who lived upstairs (where my bf and i live). The next morning we saw a jacket and a hat on the bushes directly on front of the stairs and the next morning we saw the hat on our front step. I dont think that was an accident, someone did that on purpose to send some sort of message? Id like to add that we still receive mail from the previous renters and notice that all of them are probation letters, probation debts, jail stuff, we just put them in another mailbox to send back. What if the person who lived here was gang affiliated? Should i be worried or am i just being paranoid???"

            "value": "Growing up I'd heard occasionally about these things called \"panic attacks\" that apparently some overly-sensitive people claim to get. Seriously? An attack... of panic? What a HILARIOUS concept!\n \n\nIt's probably like some precious little princess in third grade losing her shit because *Johnny flicked a booger in my hair* as her arms flail around and she screams like the little whiny girl she is. Or maybe it's like *oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, I'm running late for Yoga and I can't find my car keys and the dog just threw up* - cue more effeminate limp-wristed flailing and prancing. Or perhaps when you lose your phone and *oh shit I can't find it anywhere, where did I leave it? Was it stolen? Oh my god!* You know, just like... panicking. Everyone knows metaphorically what panic is. Some pathetic shit that little sissies get in a flap about when things aren't going their way or the food blender spills everywhere or your girlfriend sees a wasp. \n\n\n**NO.**\n\n\n**NO NO NO.**\n\n\n**NOT EVEN CLOSE.**\n\n\nI had no idea what panic was until panic came to me a decade ago. \n\n\nTwenty-four years old of strapping athletic just-graduated pilot; cocky and overconfident to the extreme, bitch to nobody and obnoxious master of the known universe. I'm sitting in a pleasant country restaurant with my family and six friends, chowing down my rib-eye steak with a fine red wine and guffawing loudly as I regale the table with stories and bask in my own assured invincibility in the pantheon of men. \n\n\nThen a strange little sensation, imperceptible at first. \n\n\nMaybe I caught some steak in my throat? No, that's not it. Hmmm, my chest feels kinda strange like a... woah why am I so sweaty? I've stopped talking because my throat has clamped shut like a vice. The oxygen flow has turned to treacle and my throat insists its never known how to swallow. Why is everyone looking at me? Fuck this room is TINY. SO CROWDED. Something is wrong. Something is very wrong. My heart is pounding. My lungs can't function. Vision narrows and greys. The walls spin as the lump in your throat becomes a tumor that envelopes your entire existence. \n\n\nThen there is this overpowering feeling; a welling-up of all-encompassing fear. It's like an ocean surge. A rumbling from the depths of your soul that comes from the pit of your stomach at the edge of consciousness, rushing up your throat and into your brain like an unstoppable juggernaut on a collision course with your own demise. It's that crescendo of violins from the most terrifying horror movies just before the monster erupts from the dark, and it's coming for me. My whole temporal experience of the world has turned inwards and I'm pinned helpless to the moment. Inside my head a deafening megaphone overpowers every other thought - *Something dark, evil and truly awful is about to happen to you and you're powerless to stop it.*\n\n\nAm I dying? Yes, that must be it. I'm dying. Fuck. I'M ACTUALLY ABOUT TO DIE. RIGHT NOW IN THIS ROOM. This is what a heart attack feels like. Your mind swims in a freezing, clammy, boiling torrent of fractured thoughts and confusing sensations as your body assumes the twitching convulsive outline of a fish caught on a hook. Vision loses focus, eyes dart in all directions. \n\n\nMY HEART! BOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM it goes, with the ruthless life-extinguishing violence of a machine-gun. Nothing seems real, seconds stretch to years. Familiar things distort into terrifying non-shapes as you try to grasp on to the slush that has suddenly replaced reality. Everything is wrong. So wrong. My universe is about to collapse. The only sensation: IMPENDING DOOM. I must escape! If only I can get out of this room in the next three nanoseconds maybe I can survive. \n\n\nI stumble to something resembling an upright position and announce garbled words in incoherent gibberish to the table before racing for the door in a shambling, hyperventilating mess. I'm dying. This is it. Any moment now. Will there be pain? I'll never see my family or loved ones again. I never even got to say goodbye. This is the end. Everything lurches and races as the world implodes around you. I sit down and hyperventilate, furiously trying to catch a breath that is never satisfied, obsessively clutching the maniac pulse in my wrist. That's no good. Stand up again. Even worse. Go outside. No, I'll just die out there. Back inside to curl up in a corner. Logic has been obliterated. I am no longer rational. All that I'm aware of is the guaranteed knowledge that I am about to pass irrevocably past the line of my sudden cardiac death. Nothing exists except my crumbling body in a thick swamp of immobilising terror. \n\n\nI'm face-down on the floor in the corner of the restaurant, panting for breath, hoping that every gasp of air I can squeeze into my lungs isn't my last and that my heart won't instantly rupture and explode in agony. This lasts an eternity. What is happening to me?\n \n\nThere is noise. A commotion. People. Hands on my shoulders. \"ARE YOU OKAY?\" \"HEY, LOOK AT ME!\" Am I okay? No I'm fucking dying you fucking idiot. Do something! Help me! *HELP ME!*\n\n\n\nFifteen minutes of absolute raw-faced terror pass, adrenaline and fear pouring from every sweaty inch of your soaked body. The interminable minutes seem like years. \n\n\nSlowly something comes together. The floor is the floor again. It's wooden. Brown. Shiny. I can touch it. That's okay. Hold on to it. The walls are here. I'm wearing blue jeans. My parents are hunched down next to me talking soothing words. \n\n\nIT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. JUST BREATHE. YOU'RE HAVING A PANIC ATTACK. DON'T WORRY. \n\n\nLike a murky runway appearing from the fog, lights of reality slowly begin to emerge. Breathing shallows. My heart starts to slow as the aura of doom subsides into a dull roar like a distant waterfall. \n\n\nDinner is abruptly abandoned and I'm driven home slackjawed, a prisoner to my own reeling mind of neural traffic jams. What the fuck just happened to me? \n\n\nBefore I know it, I'm on the couch at home with my shirt unbuttoned. An on-call doctor arrives and I try to articulate the symptoms of my almost-death. He attaches bulbous rubber suckers to my chest to perform an ECG, EEG and other tests. Everything is normal. Ask some questions, check the history. Nothing out of the ordinary, all systems nominal. \n\n\n\"He'll be fine\" the doctor laughs, putting away the machines and tape prints.  \"Classic panic attack. Rest up and drink some tea.\"\n\n\nAnd that was the day I realized that anxiety and panic attacks aren't the pitiful little hand-flailing bad hair days that I'd condescendingly imagined. \n\n\n\nIt's not the momentary nervousness of losing your phone or being late for an appointment. It's not just some trivial moment of stressful overreacting, and it certainly doesn't just happen to weak-willed schoolgirls and pussies. That's not true panic.  \n\n\nTrue panic is the instantaneous, all-encompassing explosive jolt of terrifying **certainty** that without a doubt, **you are about to die** - right here and right now as your heart explodes - and submerge suffocatingly into a crushing blackness you never knew existed. \n\n\nAnxiety burst into my life without warning during a peaceful family dinner while I was at the prime of my life, so confident in my mastery over the world that I never imagined a crippling betrayal would come from inside my own body.  It can come to anyone at any time. \n\n\nI don't laugh about that any more. "

Since coming home from school in April I've been DREADING dealing with the consequences of all this. Although I had my appeal (aka document outlining my struggles/extenuating circumstances that caused me to fail these courses and why I would like them basically removed from my transcript) ready since April I haven't been able to send it in. Every time I would log on to do it I would read over my appeal letter, criticize tf out of it, and close my browser. I would try to send it I would simply freak out and ended up getting nothing accomplished. It's been four months now since I've been trying to do this and I finally hit that send button today!!!!\n\nBasically, the point of this post is for anyone who's anxiety is keeping them from doing something they absolutely NEED to get done (or you'll be straight up screwed like me) but can't seem to find the courage to do it. Finding that bravery will make a world of difference for your anxious thoughts. Trust me. I don't think I've been this happy in years! "

There have been 3 points of my life where my anxiety was the worst, with the most recent one being May/June of 2017 at work. \n\nI was struggling at work, struggling to manage my workload and was constantly feeling overwhelmed. In May, I was told I had to give a presentation in front of the entire company, by myself, my biggest fear. After that news was delivered, I didn't sleep for an entire month, and was constantly worrying and freaking out about the day where I would have to deliver the presentation. My anxiety had become so severe that I was having panic attacks when I came into the office in the morning and I regularly contemplated quitting my job and leaving it all. My work and personal life suffered, and my anxiety consumed me. \n\nI knew I needed to do something about the way I was feeling because my anxiety combined with the insomnia was actually making me go insane. \n\nI decided to see a psychiatrist who put me on 50mg of Zoloft. She had me start at 12.5mg for 3 days, then 25mg for 3 more days, until I finally worked up to my current dosage, 50mg. \n\nThe first 2 weeks were a little difficult. I still couldn't sleep and I would get diarrhea whenever my dosage increased. But i distinctly remember over 4th of July weekend, which was about 2 weeks after I started the medication, I started feeling like my old, happy, smilegirl55443 self again.\n\nSomething in me shifted, I can't explain what it is. I've been on the medication for about 4 months now, and I'm the happiest and most successful I've ever been, in both my work life and personal life.\n\nSome positive life changes I've made in the past 4 months:\n\n* Made a core group of new friends who I really connect with on a deep level\n* Switched to a plant-based diet\n* Fell in love with my job and initiated a re-org at my company, which led to my position morphing into my current dream job\n* Read books on personal growth and strengthened the relationships in my life\n* Started loving myself again\n* Started sleeping like a baby again\n* Learned to take criticism without becoming upset - I now think of it as a positive thing and a way to improve myself in a new way\n\nI hope my story helps anyone who is thinking about trying medication. I too was at rock bottom, desperate to try anything to feel normal again. Medication has different side effects for everyone, and this is only my experience, it may be different for you.\n\nI hope this post helps someone who is feeling the way I was a few months ago.\n\n*Edited for formatting.

I also tend to compare myself a lot to other people, and I get very down and envious about the fact that I'm not \"as good\", with my well-meaning friends always telling me \"you don't need to be as good, it's not a race, go at your own pace, your work is still appreciated, etc etc\". *I know* logically this is all true. But knowing this doesn't magically make those thoughts go away. No matter how hard I try to articulate this, they just cannot seem to understand and it's endlessly frustrating.\n\nAny advice?

Being able to identify anxious thinking is the first step in dealing with it. \n\n1) **Probability Overestimations**- Exaggerated beliefs about the chances of a negative event or outcome happening. \n\nExamples: Thinking that there is a high chance of dying in a plane crash. Assuming that your best friend doesn't like you anymore because they didn't respond to your text right away. Most \"What if...\" type thoughts. \n\n2) **All or Nothing Type Thinking**- Black/White thought patterns, judging everything as good or bad without recognizing that life is, in fact,  mostly \"grey area\". Judging something as negative when it is actually neutral. This type of thinking plays a big part for people that struggle with perfectionism. \n\nExamples: Interpreting someones neutral facial expressions as negative because they aren't obviously happy- \"If it's not positive than it must be negative\". -On diet> eat cupcake> think diet in now ruined> proceed to eat entire XL pizza & wings b/c your diet is \"ruined\" anyway due to the cupcake. \n\n3) **Catastrophic Thinking**- Exaggerating the importance of an event or outcome. (Not to be confused with point #1: probability overestimation, although the two are intimately related.) Underestimating your ability to cope in the unlikely event that the \"worst possible case\" does come true.  \n\nExample: \"If this first date doesn't go well I will probably die alone with 80 cats.\" When in reality, if the date doesn't go well it holds no power over the rest of your life. In reality, 5 minuets after the date is over, it doesn't matter anymore.\n\n\"It will ruin my life if my new coworkers don't like me\" When in reality, even if they hate you, you can always get a new job, or even be professionally successful without having a personal relationship with your colleagues. \n\n4) **Personalization**- Blaming yourself and only yourself for negative situations. \n\nExample \"That was an awkward conversation because I am awkward\". When in reality the other person has 50% responisibilty for the conversation.\n\n5) **Mind Reading**- Making assumption about what others think. \n\nExample: \"That server was a dick to me because she doesn't like me\" when in reality she was just in a bad mood because her husband cheated on her. \n\n6) **Selective Attention and Memory**- This is the tendency to focus on information that is consistent with your beliefs. If you believe that the world is dangerous or that people don't like you or that you are unworthy etc etc, your brain will pay attention to \"evidence\" that is consistent with your beliefs. Kind of like how you always notice cars on the road that are the same as yours. \n\nExample: You notice the 3 people who you perceived to look negative during your presentation and ignore the 15 that looked positive or neutral. Or worse, you perceived the neutral to be negative (see point #2).\n\nWhat types of distorted thinking do you engage in the most? What are some specific examples? \n"

            "value": "Today, I'm in a class of nearly 40 Japanese JHS students, every English teacher in the school and important people from the board of education. The lesson, which is usually made by me, was very poor because Japanese teacher I work with made the plan and I translated it though her (low level) English. Today she was a nervous wreck and I was cool, calm and collected.\n\nI'm an Assistant Language Teacher in Japan. Been here for over a year and a half. I came here as a challenge and to see the world. About seven years ago my psychologist said that I would be exploring big cities like Tokyo one day. Back then I didn't believe her. \n\nAt 18 I was diagnosed with panic attacks, depression and anxiety. The combination of genetics, an abusive parent, poor grades, a shitty job, living in a tiny and remote town and no direction. I managed to only pass high school because we worked out a deal where I sit at the back of the exam room and allowed music. Thinking back now, I can't even imagine what I looked or sounded like.\n\nEventually an incident at 19 got me kicked out of home and into the world. Most people head around the world or into higher learning at this age. Me, I just started working the same shitty job but this time in a new town. Even that proved too much and I ended up on unemployment benefits. Sometimes I had a job but nothing lasted more than 3 months, like any relationship I had.\n\nStayed there with various minor substance abuse issues and other addictions until 25 when I finally got the psychiatric help I needed. I found out how abusive that parent really was, how my thinking could be changed and new paths that I could take to recovery. \n\n26, I moved to the city and by 27 I was traveling the country. At 28 a job fell in my lap and I took it. Teaching students one on one. \n\nI still had my off days at work but my boss was supportive. I managed to work there for two years while I studied for my degree. I was still on benefits but my reliance was becoming less and less as my employment confidence grew.\n\nThen I got a job in Japan, sold everything I had and moved countries. I remember being on the train coming into Tokyo from the airport, \"What my psych said came true. I'm actually doing this!\" When I stepped into my first class it was the worst class in the worst school. That's when I thought \"What the fuck have I done.\" At 18, I would have run away. I wouldn't know how to manage my emotions. All I could think was \"just stay put and focus on the task at hand\".\n\nThat's what I did and I survived. Since then I've had other days like that but I know I can deal with them. Now I'm teaching full classes with relative ease but it took a while for the training wheels to come off.\n\nToday my anxious Japanese teacher was all over the place. Coming up to me and wanting to change the plan. Erratic in her thoughts and actions. I could see why (because she wants to do a good job) but it was unnecessary. Just relaxing and working through what we planned was best. I look at her and see my old self. I respond to her in a calm voice and tell her that it's okay, everything is under control. I'm responding to my old self as my new self.\n\nThe class went fairly terribly but after in the meeting I stayed relaxed. I spoke when I felt it necessary and didn't take anything personally.\n \nDuring and after the class I had a few moments of zen. Realizing how far I had come and how hard I've worked at controlling my emotions. If my 18 year old self was told what I was doing now he would never believe it.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI must say that I have little reason to come to this sub now. I try to look to the future instead of my past. That said, I hope that my story can inspire others. I have been long term unemployed, on the brink of homelessness, had breakdowns, throw out of share houses, failed subjects, been addicted and isolated myself. Somehow I made it through and each little success (now matter how small) built me into who I am today. I'm still learning but today warranted some reflection.\n\nTL:DR - Used to have crippling anxiety and now I don't so much.  "

This is going to be long but I am just going to spill my guts on what Ive been doing for the past month before my test.\n\nWhat a day. At times my heart was pounding, almost all day my palms were sweating. Sometimes I thought I was going to be sick. But I was there. And I did it. I took the test.\n\nNo, I didnt pass. I was so nervous that I made mistakes that I dont normally make, mostly dealing with observation. It wasnt awful. I drove quite well through most of it. I just happened to make 2 mistakes that were bad enough to make me fail by 4 points.\n\nBut I dont like using the word \"fail\", because I didnt. I did something that at one point I truly thought I would never do in my life. In that, **I succeeded**. And I am fully ready to dust myself off and try again. Now, some words of advise for people who are in the same position as I was.\n\nJust GETTING to this point was an incredible challenge, and I had to do some very specific, and actually non-cliche things to get to where I am, mentally. I recommend doing all these things while your anxiety is being treated by a professional, whether that is just your GP or a CBT.\n\nFirst of all, **stop looking at this as a success or failure thing, as though its really that simple for us**. Imagining yourself with only those 2 options puts too much pressure on you. Dont ever look at it like youve only got one shot in your life to take your drivers test, or that youve only ever got one shot in your life to be successful. Thats not true. You need to look at it as you simply doing a task that you need to do, like running an errand. Either you complete it today or you complete it another day. You dont fail/lose if you dont complete it today. Just take the action of doing it. If you dont get what you need to get done done then you can always go back and do it again, just like forgetting eggs at the store and having to make a second trip.\n\nNext, I have a question. **Have you ever pictured yourself driving before, or does your mind always imagine you in the passenger seat by default?** Dont look at it as though you *belong* in the passenger seat, like its just some natural thing to you. Listen to me, you *can* drive. You have that ability. I mean that. Picturing yourself doing this is the most important step you will ever do in this process. You need to just close your eyes and picture yourself driving normally. No drama. Stop picturing some deadly crash, or embarrassing blunder. Which brings me to my next point.\n\n**Write about it.** Cant picture yourself driving normally without bad things happening? Ok, heres what I did. On your computer, make a secret place to write. Nobody will ever know about it. Its your private space to vent. Write about driving. Write anything you want, but you need to find a way to put a positive spin on it. You need to end your writing with *something* about you achieving your goal. You can write a little story about you taking and passing the test. I wasnt able to do that, so I just settled with typing out the pros and cons of getting my licence, ending my little diary entry on the pros. I just really let my thoughts flow. I wrote everything I was thinking. It felt so good to let out these thoughts that, honestly, I was running away from and trying to ignore a lot (for the sake of not getting anxiety)...but, bottling things up creates anxiety of its own. You need to express your thoughts somehow. When your done writing about driving, read what you wrote back to yourself while doing calm breaths. Then just spend some time thinking about it. If you know how to lucid dream, I highly reccommend trying to dream about driving. That is part of how your brain processes things, and I think the trouble with anxiety is that sometimes avoiding an anxiety attack about something means you dont let yourself think about it, so you dont let your brain process stuff. Dreaming is literally designed for your brain to process different situations so this is a great technique.\n\n**Anxiety will always try to fool you**. Listen, I know that car accidents happen, but your anxiety is making you think they happen way more often and to way more people than they really do. It blows up your perception of the likelyhood of something happening to you to extreme proportions. Stop looking at it as though something WILL happen. I IS good enough to say \"it probably wont\". You act as though saying \"it probably wont happen to me\" is you fooling yourself into thinking your safer than you are, but thats not true. Instead, you are fooling yourself into thinking you are in more danger than you are. *Live your life*. Dont be imprisoned by anxiety. Break anxieties illusion.\n\n Anxiety is tricky, because it puts us inside of an illusion. **You need to learn how to recognize when you are seeing the world through anxieties illusion, or through what it really is.** What a wonderful thing that we live in the age of the internet. Do not always assume the worst. I can assume that I will win the lottery tomorrow. That doesnt make it true. Instead of assuming, wouldnt it be smarter to look up the statistics of me winning and come to a conclusion based on that? I can do that with google. Information is so freely avaliable to us today. Allow yourself to think critically instead of emotionally when assessing risks. \n\n* There were 29,989 fatal motor vehicle crashes in the United States in 2014. The American popuation in 2014 was roughly 318,900,000. What a small number of people compared to the entire population! **Now think**. How many of those people were drinking? How many of those people were high? How many of those people were texting? How many of them were being dumb with their friends driving recklessly for fun? Guys....you have anxiety. Are you really going to do those things? We are so damn cautious. When you cut out all the people who were under the influence and being stupid for funzies, what is left? How many people got cut out of the number 29,989, out of 318,900,000?\n\n**JUST DO IT.** This is for people who already know how to drive but are terrified of taking the test. Go to the DMV with someone you are close to and schedule your appointment even if you are completely not emotionally ready. Now, this wont work for everyone, but for people with anxiety who are big on deadlines this might be the push you need. Make sure you give yourself time to process your fear. Dont just say \"yeah, Ill take it next week\" if thats a completely unrealistic time for you to process things. For me, I scheduled mine a little over a month ahead. And, yeah, I wasnt sure if Id be able to process it in that time either but what matters is you are giving yourself a lengthy amount of time, but not so lengthy you think you might back out of it. Sometimes its good to put pressure on yourself. And you know what? If you back out you back out. But, you want to do this right? Just chance it and schedule the test....just to see what happens. Make sure you do all the steps I have talked about before if you do this.\n\n**The day before and of your test, put as many other stressors behind you as you can. Dont you dare think about anything but happy/calm things and your test**. If you can put anything off for a day or two, you need to do that. (**This includes any thoughts of the future or \"what if?\"s.**) Just do it until you take your test, then you can worry about other tasks and stressors when you are done. The trouble with anxiety is that we tend to focus on all our stressors at the same time and it overwhelms us. Well, just like some of us are able to avoid thinking about driving, you can do the same thing about any other stressor. Shift gears and ignore all stressors except for driving for a day. Again, Id like to emphasize that this does not mean do nothing but think about driving all day long. It just means that driving takes up enough stress in itself for you so you need to make room for it *should that stress come about*, instead of overwhelming yourself with everything at once.\n\n**THE DAY OF, think about the fact that you have anxiety and are scared out of your freaking mind as little as possible** or else you will start making excuses for yourself and also psyche yourself out. Positive or neural thoughts only. If you arent sure you are going to pass, dont lie to yourself and say \"oh yeah, Ive totally got this\", because that puts pressure on you. But also dont think \"Oh god I am going to fail\". Instead go for a neutral thought that is *true* like \"You know what? I am just going to do this.\". Everytime feel a negative thought coming on switch to \"You know what? Im going to do this.\". \n\nFinally, **you may or may not have people you want to get the licence for, but at the end of the day nothing pushes you better than the desire to do this for YOU.** Honestly, that was the final push. And, you know what? I didnt decide I wanted to do this for me until THE DAY BEFORE THE TEST. But now I am more determined than ever. I feel like before I *thought* I wanted to get my licence for me, but, really, a piece of me was still secretly copping out and feeling ok with going the rest of my life without driving. How can I respect myself and think that? What a disservice I would be doing for myself. DO THIS because its good for you. DO this so you can remove limitations that not having a licence puts on you. Do this because you love yourself and you want to help yourself. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or thoughts. Id love to hear what you have to say and help whoever I can."

Except the ones I found were all expensive or unappealing (to me). So I decided to make one myself.\n\nSo this is my app, What's Up?, the product of about 8 months work. It includes over 60 simple grounding techniques to help keep you grounded, thinking patterns and metaphors to help you keep your thoughts in check, and a diary and habit tracker. It also has a few different themes if you see the screenshots and aren't a fan of the colors. Any sort of feedback is appreciated, so feel free to let me know what you think and make suggestions :)\n\nLinks:  \nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jacksontempra.apps.whatsup  \n\niOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/whats-up/id968251160?ls=1&amp;mt=8  \n\n  \nEDIT: If you can't get the iOS version in your app store, try replacing the 'us' in the link with your countries code or whatever for example gb or au\n\nEDIT 2: I just wanted to say a massive thankyou to all the support you guys are giving me. It honestly means the world to me that you'll be able to make use of the app. As I said previously, as someone who has been through depression and still faces anxiety, it's incredible to be able to use the knowledge I've gained to help others get through tough times.\n Thank you all so much <3\n\nEDIT 3: It's called What's Up? because I forgot to say the name of it and added the name in the post\n\nEDIT 4: Not sure if people are still viewing but if you are, I've read every single comment and released a massive update (2.0) which adds lots of things that were requested including being able to backup and sync data between devices :) Hope everyone is doing good :)"

The reality is, is that my grand kids won't ever know how significant she is and was to be, neither will they know how much she has meant to me. After their life times, my great grandmother will no longer be remember as she will have never met future generations.

That was easy enough and I noticed I was a lot less scared than I thought I would be. I arrived at my first location, from there I had to catch a bus. I hate busses as they give me so much anxiety (I'm always worried I'd get the wrong bus or get off at the wrong bus stop or something) waiting for the bus I managed to strike a conversation with an older man, he confirmed that I was waiting for the correct bus to get to the cemetery.\n\nSoon enough the bus pulled in, I asked the driver if they go to the cemetery, he confirmed so I payed the driver and sat down nervously.

This weekend I took off (I'm the CEO trying to be more efficient) & didn't check my E-mail Friday, so I knew I'd be in for a surprise Monday. I have a tendency to get sucked into notifications (even if but a text) and want to know how I can over-come this to not be worried, and more importantly not get sucked into responding to everything. \n\nHey guys, I used to have a tiny bit of shyness & anxiety when I was younger. I'm 19 now, and had forced myself to go out quite a bit (meet women, talk, etc.) and I found that my anxiety all but went away (socially)! \n\nI got an injury though & have been stuck at home for a few months, going out is VERY limited. I kind of let it take me over (I have anxiety around injuries) and hid inside, afraid of getting a set-back (which ironically set me back). Anyways, thought I should share that because it might explain why...:\n\nI went to check my E-mail this morning. I run my own business, and there was just something this morning about checking my E-mail where I was SO SCARED to check it! I had 3 Skype messages, and about 10 E-mails (8 of which were useless). I saw the notifications and had that \"ping\" in my chest like I was gonna die.. \n\nI'm wondering if maybe it's because I haven't been going out. So, in my isolation, the body is naturally becoming anxious again. I might have to force myself to go out even through my physical pain because oh my gosh was checking my E-mail probably the hardest thing today... I can run a multi-national business from home, yet checking what needs to be done today was too scary. I don't understand lol.\n\nSo guys & girls- does checking notifications make you anxious? I find that when I get \"down\" it creates this loop where I'm anxious to check, but I am also addicted to checking (and getting sucked in to whatever it is). It's like I can't leave one notification un-responded. Maybe that's why I was so anxious... this was the first weekend (and Friday) that I didn't check my E-mail AT ALL, so I knew a couple messages would be waiting. "

            "value": "So if you\u2019re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I\u2019ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don\u2019t stop, I\u2019ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I\u2019ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I\u2019ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I\u2019ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I\u2019ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I\u2019ve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.\n\nBut I\u2019m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I\u2019ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn\u2019t really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .\n\nSo I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you\u2019re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.\n\nI don\u2019t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you\u2019re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don\u2019t feel it makes enough of a difference.\n\nBefore you read, I want to mention something once so I don\u2019t have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you\u2019ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you\u2019ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It\u2019s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it\u2019ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.\n\nSo here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.\n\nIf you\u2019re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can\u2019t calm down:\n\nAt this stage, you\u2019re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I\u2019ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.\n\n**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:\n\n* Don\u2019t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you\u2019ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. \n\n* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.\n\n* If this isn\u2019t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won\u2019t stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you\u2019ve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you\u2019ll find it can\u2019t. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you\u2019re interested, the clinical term for this is \u201carousal reappraisal.\u201d It\u2019s not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. \n\n**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being \u201cengaged.\u201d This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you\u2019re at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it\u2019s an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. \n\n**3.** Give it time. Your system can\u2019t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you\u2019ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.\n\n**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they\u2019re no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn\u2019t feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you\u2019ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you\u2019re in a constant state of panic, they\u2019re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.\n\n**5.** Journal. I don\u2019t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I\u2019ve found it doesn\u2019t really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you\u2019re thinking or feeling. It\u2019s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.\n\n**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don\u2019t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you\u2019re getting for something productive.\n\n**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It\u2019s much easier to feel short of breath when you\u2019re in a position that doesn\u2019t let you breath easily. If you\u2019re lying down, lay on your back. If you\u2019re sitting, sit up straight.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.\n\nConstant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:\n\nIf you\u2019re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you\u2019re not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here\u2019s what to do at this stage:\n\n**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you\u2019re going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what\u2019s going on in your brain and body, the better you\u2019ll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they\u2019ll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you\u2019re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):\n\n* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who\u2019s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you\u2019re at the higher end of the anxiety scale.\n\n* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It\u2019s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It\u2019s long, so I don\u2019t think you need to do the first part, but there\u2019s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.\n\n* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.\n\n* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren\u2019t worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as \u201can incurable disease\u201d in this book. He\u2019s not a doctor or therapist and isn\u2019t really knowledgeable on the subject, so I\u2019d take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.\nRemember, the point of these books isn\u2019t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.\n\n**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you\u2019ll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:\n\n* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you\u2019re saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?\n\n* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn\u2019t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. \n\n* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?\nIt may take a while until you find a therapist who\u2019s right for you, but this is a person you\u2019ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. \n\n**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they\u2019ll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you\u2019re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you\u2019re down to two a day, try one.\n\n**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:\n\n* Cardiovascular exercise. It\u2019s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you\u2019re anxious, but I\u2019d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you\u2019re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don\u2019t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you\u2019re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don\u2019t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you\u2019ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.\n\n* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you\u2019re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it\u2019s almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you\u2019re just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won\u2019t go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.\n\n* Diet. If you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019ve probably read the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of your diet about a hundred times, but I\u2019ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn\u2019t entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I\u2019ll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won\u2019t bring change. \n\n* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor\u2019s discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don\u2019t. I didn\u2019t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn\u2019t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won\u2019t change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.\n\n**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn\u2019t change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve been at these things for a while, you\u2019ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.\n\nHovering around 4 - 6:\n\nIf you\u2019re at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you\u2019ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn\u2019t manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you\u2019re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You\u2019ve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you\u2019re still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here\u2019s what you should do at this stage:\n\n**1.** Keep staying the course. It\u2019s easy to flounder or stop, and it\u2019s okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don\u2019t beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it\u2019s part of what makes us human. And it\u2019s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.\n\n**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you\u2019ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I\u2019d find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren\u2019t meant to be fun**. If you\u2019ve got social anxiety and you\u2019re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it\u2019ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you\u2019ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it\u2019ll become more and more natural over time.\n\n**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you\u2019re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of \u201cI\u2019ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren\u2019t I seeing my anxiety improve?\u201d And the answer in this case is because this person wasn\u2019t pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn\u2019t expect to see improvement.\n\n**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It\u2019s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you\u2019re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you\u2019re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can\u2019t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true. \n\n**5.** Give it time. I\u2019ve said it before but it\u2019s important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren\u2019t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.\n\nI think it\u2019s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that\u2019s kind of vague, I\u2019ll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you\u2019re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you\u2019re someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself \u201cthat conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I\u2019m a loser.\u201d In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don\u2019t know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn\u2019t see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.\n\nAt this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you\u2019re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you\u2019re the one person out of the fifty who\u2019s somehow figured out you\u2019re losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn\u2019t make it true**.\n\nOne of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it\u2019s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you\u2019re most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they\u2019re both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you\u2019ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.\n\nAnxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:\n\nYou\u2019re in the home stretch. This is it. You\u2019re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you\u2019ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you\u2019ve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I\u2019d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you\u2019ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it\u2019s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you\u2019re almost home free.\n\nNote: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you\u2019ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don\u2019t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don\u2019t really illicit a response from you. At this stage:\n\n**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you\u2019ve clearly demonstrated they work. All that\u2019s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you\u2019ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. \n\n**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you\u2019re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you\u2019ll feel.\n\n**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you\u2019ve had anxiety and use what you\u2019ve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you\u2019re able to ease, the better you\u2019ll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would\u2019ve never been able to do.\n\nThere really isn\u2019t much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you\u2019ve done so far and that there\u2019s more to come.\n\nThen finally\u2026\n\nNo anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:\n\nThat\u2019s it. All the voices in your head telling you you\u2019re not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don\u2019t really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you\u2019re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you\u2019ve never had. It\u2019s been a few months since you\u2019ve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you\u2019re not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they\u2019ll go away just as quickly as they came.\n\nI don\u2019t have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you\u2019ll keep on doing it. \n\nCongratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.\n_\n\nMy therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it\u2019s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it\u2019s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it\u2019s telling you you\u2019re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that\u2019s not true. If it\u2019s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don\u2019t. If it\u2019s telling you you\u2019re losing your mind, remind yourself you\u2019re not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. \n\n**Summary:**\n\n**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it\u2019s just anxiety and can\u2019t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You\u2019ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**\n\n**Don\u2019t fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**\n\n**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you\u2019ll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**\n\n**Keep pushing the bounds of what you\u2019re doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you\u2019ve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it\u2019ll only benefit you in the end.**\n\n**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn\u2019t make it true. You\u2019ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you\u2019ve been dreading isn\u2019t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**\n\n**Give it time. You\u2019ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**\n\nThank you for reading this.

An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.\n\nGood luck guys :)\n\nEdit 3: Tossed another David Burns book (author of Feeling Good), **When Panic Attacks**, up in the book list.

            "value": "So I've had really severe anxiety and panic attacks for about 6 years. Sometimes it was manageable, sometimes not. During the last half of last year it was really escalating to a point where it was worse than before, peaking around Christmas. I was having panic attack after panic attack which was very unusual, and taking a lot more Xanax than I ever needed to before. So I looked around the area and found a local hospital that had an anxiety & OCD program, supposedly one of the best in the country. \n\n\nMost of what the program focused on was exposure therapy and CBT. I feel like exposure therapy is rarely discussed here, yet it seems to be one of the most common methods among the psych community for dealing with anxiety. So here's kind of a simple break down on what they teach.\n\n\n#Exposure\n***\n\n**Create an exposure program**- This is the hardest part and something that was foreign to me when I began the program. The intent of this is to expose yourself to what gives you anxiety, so that after repeated exposures the anxiety will lessen over time. So the first thing you want to do is to make a \"hierarchy of anxiety triggers\". You want to make a list of your trigger, whether you avoid it, and how much anxiety it gives you on a scale of 1-10, as such:\n\n**Hierarchy** (People, places, thoughts, things, sensations)\n\n\nTrigger | Avoided? (yes/no) | Anxiety (0-10)\n:--|:--:|--:\nRiding in an elevator | Yes  | 5\nShowering | No | 4\n\nThis will help in creating your exposure program, as you want to begin with exposures that are lower on your hierarchy. If you start at a 10 trigger, you may not be able to handle sitting with that anxiety. You want to start with a couple triggers that are lower, like 2 or 3, where you can handle that level of anxiety and learn to handle these exposures. \n\nSo take an exposure, for example, maybe you have terrible anxiety about driving. Break it down into steps, it's better to include more steps, and smaller ones than you may really beed. If you do a step and it produces little or no anxiety, then move on right away to the next step. Maybe the first step you just sit in the car in your garage or driveway with the door open. Then you move on to closing the door, then adding the key to the ignition, then run the engine, drive to the end of the driveway and back again. You would then move on to driving onto the street, then back to the driveway, and so on and so forth. \n\nThe point is that with each step, if it produces a decent amount of anxiety then your goal is to sit with that anxiety, until it comes down to about half of its original intensity. It doesn't sound fun, but you want your anxiety to go up, that's the entire point of the exercise. You will feel uncomfortable, and that's fine, that's the point. After repeated exposures that level of discomfort and anxiety will lessen. \n\nHere are some other examples- people with social anxiety would go up to people and make small talk, or talk in our group sessions for their exposure work. \n\nAnother exposure quite a few of us would do is write out 'worst case scenarios'. This could be writing out a detailed scenario where maybe you die from a heart attack, or where you write out an idea of making a fool of yourself in front of others, or someone you love dies. You want to be as detailed as possible, you write it, then read it and imagine it, see if it gives you anxiety and then sit with it. Then you would do a worksheet about your worst case scenario(posted down a bit further) and reframe your thoughts about this possible scenario.\n\n\n\n\n**Panic exposures (interoceptives)**\n***\n\nIf you suffer from panic attacks, the goal of this type of exposure is to try and recreate the physical sensations you may experience during an intense panic attack. Again the intent is that repeated exposure to these sensations will make you more accustomed to them, and make you less anxious when you experience them. If you have had an intense panic attack you know a lot of the common physiological manifestations- dizziness, feeling out of breath, increased HR, palpitations, sweating, shaking, cold chills, hot flashes, nausea, etc. \n\nSo here is a list of interoceptives you can do to try and recreate symptoms that are similar to what you personally experience during a panic attack:\n\n-Shake head from side to side for 30 seconds\n-Place head between legs for 30 seconds\n-Run in place for 1 minute\n-Hold breath for 30 seconds\n-Breathe through a large straw for 1 minute\n-Breathe through a small straw for 1 minute\n-Spin for 1 minute\n-Do push ups for 1 minute\n-Hyperventilate for 1 minute\n-Tense your muscles for 1 minute\n-Put books on your chest for 1 minute\n\nSo you could do all of these, and then rate the intensity of the sensations you felt and how much fear it creates, and whether or not it's similar to the feelings you get during a natural panic attack. For instance:\n\nExercise | Sensations | Intensity 1-10 | Fear 1-10 | Similar 1-10\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n\n\nSo you choose those which give you anxiety, and sit with it. Give yourself some time in between, then repeat. You do these until these physical sensations give you less and less anxiety. \n\n\n\n\n**CBT**\n***\n\nEssentially what CBT boils down to is changing your thoughts and actions(or behaviors) in situations. How you interpret and perceive the situation or object of your anxiety determines your discomfort. You can't avoid all situations and anxieties, so your goal is to fix your perception and attitude.\n\nWhat you can do is work on CBT worksheets to evaluate your anxiety, and your thoughts about them. We want to examine these thoughts and behaviors, and then work to reframe these thoughts. This is the worksheet we used: https://imgur.com/a/m23WO . There are many other type of worksheets you can find online as well. You can do these worksheets with any type of trigger you have, examine the trigger with a critical eye, and work toward reframing your thoughts when you have a trigger. Much of this we know won't work when you're in the grips of a full panic attack, but the point of this is to nip your anxiety in the bud before it gets to that point. Identifying cognitive distortions and moving away from anxiety will become second nature when you do more and more CBT worksheets.\n\n\n\n\n**Things to Remember**\n***\n\n**Your goal is not to eliminate anxiety completely** - This is something you may not think about, or goes against what you think you want, but anxiety is a natural and integral part of life. Without fear or anxiety, you would approach a grizzly bear in the wild and try to pet it. We need anxiety, and we need to learn to live with it. \n\n**Anxiety won't kill you** - Anxiety is a normal human response our ancestors needed for survival, it will not kill you. It will make you uncomfortable, but it will not kill you. You're not going to go crazy, you're not going to die. \n\n**Relaxation** - A good way to help calm yourself is to practice relaxation techniques habitually. There are various methods to achieve a relaxed state- abdominal deep breathing, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, visualizing a peaceful scene. Like everything else, you must dedicate time to these behaviors to reap the positive results. Physiological responses to relaxation include a decrease in HR, BP, muscle tension, oxygen consumption, analytical thinking, etc. Relaxation works to prevent stress from becoming cumulative, boiling over into anxiety attacks or increasing your generalized anxiety.  \n\n**What NOT to do**\n***\n\n**Seek reassurance** - I would often do this with my health anxiety or panic attacks. I would check my BP or HR, my wife would comfort me, I would go to the ER. These are all ways to seek reassurance, and they are not good for you. \n\nI often see comments in this forum about a loved one giving comfort and telling the person suffering with anxiety that \"they will be OK\", they shouldn't. You should tell your loved ones not to reassure you. Receiving reassurance doesn't work, and it doesn't help in the long term. \n\nAnother way of reassurance is having support objects. Maybe you carry Xanax with you wherever you go, I did for years. Or I would always have my phone nearby in case I need to call 911 because I have a fear of suddenly dying or suffering a catastrophic medical emergency. Or I would always wear shoes in the house in case something crazy happened and I needed to be ready to go right then and there. These are all examples of relying on support objects, you falsely believe they protect you and you start to depend on them. This is another step where you need to start gradually eliminating the need to carry your support objects, you can and will survive without them. This leads me into the next point...\n\n**Try to eliminate all uncertainty** - Nothing in life is certain, and we have to learn to accept that. It's funny what we have anxieties about, and what we don't. I am a young healthy person, but I have had unrelenting health anxiety where I think I'm going to die, yet perplexingly driving in my car doesn't give me anxiety. This makes no sense! Driving is the most dangerous and possibly fatal activity I do on a daily basis, but I don't give it a second thought! You and I may not be here tomorrow, or in an hour, life is uncertain, it's something you need to learn to live with. A lot of anxiety is about things we can't control, what may or may not happen. What if, what if, what if. Ground yourself to your present moment. Identify objects in your room, take deep breaths, feel the fabric of the chair you're sitting in, smell the scent of the air. You're here, right now, in this moment, be there. What comes will come.\n\n**Distractions** - Sometimes when I used to get really anxious I would play a video game. This would take my mind off my anxiety and distract me, I thought this was a great method. This is not the case. If your attention is engaged elsewhere then you don't have to worry about your anxiety. Except this leads to a point where all you think you have to do is think the \"wrong\" thing and panic or anxiety may set in. Essentially distractions are just a form of avoidance...\n\n**Avoidance** - Avoidance is a huge one, and one we probably all have partaken in. The problem with avoidance, aside from that it doesn't work, is that your world becomes smaller and smaller and smaller. Maybe you had anxiety at the grocery store, so you avoid that grocery store. Then you had a bad attack at a family members house, so you start avoiding that house. You avoid people, places, things, activities, suddenly you're feeling isolated on an island, which of course makes your stress worse and you feel more anxious. \n\nIf you avoid all you fear, you don't get to experience what would have happened if you had encountered it. By \"protecting\" yourself against these things, you make yourself more anxious because you never overcome your fear of them. Any place or thing could soon become an avoidance, how many more will there be? You must expose yourself, you must sit with the anxiety, you can and will overcome it, or at least tolerate it. \n\n**Fight your anxiety** - In the program, my case workers always hoped I would have a bad panic attack so that they could make me sit with it. I never had one in program, but they told me they would essentially tell me \"You're having a panic attack? Ok.\". The goal is to let the anxiety come, acknowledge it, let it pass. My go-to for panic attacks was almost always the ER, that was my flight go-to response. I have had some minor ones, and now I have sat through them. I feel like I'm making progress. \n\n\n\n\n**Summary**\n***\n\nI know this isn't comprehensive and there's so much more I have, I have a folder full of printouts and info. I went for about 5 weeks. I had to take Klonopin for a while because my anxiety was so bad. I'm also now on an anti-depressant. Taking new medication would always give me awful anxiety, so even being able to do that was a big obstacle I overcame. Medication isn't always needed if you have anxiety, but for some it may help you.\n\nIf anyone has any questions, please ask, I'd be happy to share or elaborate if I can. I just wanted to write this because I so often see people talking positively about receiving reassurance, which is not good, and so little talk about exposure, which has been shown to help so much. \n\nI hope everyone's doing ok, have a good weekend!\n\nEdit: Duh, of course I have to add a healthy diet, sleep, and exercise are also so important to your physical, and mental health. This wasn't discussed as much, but just a reminder to stay active and treat your body well."

I avoided going for many years, as I was apprehensive about being given a label or being put on medication. But yeah, therapy is nothing like I imagined, and I have noticed a big difference over only two sessions (up and down like a yoyo, but still an overall improvement).\n\nANYWAY. The really simple tips we've run through already:\n\n- Buy lavender fabric softener and wash your bedding with it. Lavender is naturally calming. I'm typing away in my room and it smells like heaven in here.\n\n- Grab some lavender oil! You can put this in your bath, and oil burner, or apply to your temples/back of neck/forehead. It's also nice to put a few drops on your pillow cases.\n\n- Walk in the morning (6/6:30am) and walk after work/in the afternoon. WITH MUSIC. This drowns out those horrible intrusive, self destructive thoughts.\n\n- Establish a bedtime routine. I now drink a cup of 'sleep time' tea, read and meditate (simple guided meditation - try applications Headspace and Smiling Mind). Note the best sleep you get is before 12am. I am trying to go to bed earlier, and rise earlier. \n\n- When you feel up to leaving the house and visiting the supermarket, stock up on super easy (but healthy) foods. Cheese, nice bread, frozen veggies, fruit, eggs, yoghurt etc.\n\nI hope these tips help you as much as they have helped me. \n"

I wake up in the night, realize I haven't gotten much sleep, then feel even worse, and just descend into a helpless, scared panic, unless I can head it off, usually with the help of drugs. \n\nThe past few nights I've been listening to [Sleep With Me](http://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com/). It's a podcast wherein the host tells long, rambling stories designed specifically to captivate but not excite the listener. The idea is to keep your attention, distract you from yourself, and ease you into sleep. I woke up last night, starting out of sleep with a jolt, and normally that would have meant a restless night. But I had left the podcast playing, and it gave me something to focus on besides my fearful thoughts. I was back asleep within ten minutes.\n\nThe host has an inimitable quality of voice to catch your attention and hold it, but to let you drift along with him, filling his stories with boring details, side plots that go nowhere, embelishments that don't add anything, little asides that always seem about to reveal something profound but just sort of lilt back down like a falling leaf. It's not like white noise or beach sounds or whale song because there's an actual \"narrative\" that tricks you into paying attention. And all in a voice that's part Bob Ross and part bored DMV clerk; it's hard to describe, but the host - Dearest Scooter - has a tired, earnest voice that you *want* to listen to, but never *says* anything. There's no coherent plot, but you're never tempted to switch off, because the next moment maybe - *maybe* - it will lead somewhere. It's hypnotic and distracting and it puts me out like a light.\n\nI know what it's like to be trapped away from sleep. I was skeptical of this podcast; it seemed too simple, too easy. If anyone else here has trouble sleeping, or you need something that will distract you from your thoughts without further exciting them, I cannot recommend this podcast high enough. It's free and there's hundreds (400+ and counting)* of episodes. You'll never run out. Please please *please* try this. It could help you. I hope so. \n\n*edit\n\nhttp://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com/\n\nhttp://www.dailydot.com/upstream/drew-ackerman-sleep-with-me-podcast/\n\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-podcast-that-tells-ingeniously-boring-bedtime-stories-to-help-you-fall-asleep"

Here we go:\n\n1. Quit Caffeine. ( this was a huge step)\n\n2. Hang out with friends and do this a lot ( if you don't have any just go to the nearest coffee shop drink your lemonade and watch people passing by\n\n3. Eat mostly clean but if you crave something just do it once or twice a week. \n\n4. Meditate at least 15 minutes a day ( especially when times are bad is when you need it. ) \n\n5. Go exercise. I can't stress this enough it has helped boosting my mood and my self - esteem a lot \n\n6. Sauna, Jacuzzi, Massage . Do those, sometimes the tension we feel is trapped inside of our bodies and we really need someone to get it out \n\n7. Force yourself to go outside the house everyday even walking 5 minutes.\n\n8. Rest and do this a lot, don't find this as an excuse to proscastinate but really take a break you might be doing too much and some things people do efforless we put to much energy and struggle to do it and that burns as off. Just rest. Play your favorite video game, have a beer if you like, talk to someone just take a break. \n\n9. Talk to people: Just say hi and contunue your day, this will help you understand that people are not monsters and they won't bite you. \n\n10. Always remember that you are awesome and your life it's the most precious and important thing you have and at the end it's you vs you, bad times maybe here and you think now that they won't surpass but DO remember and believe that it will get better and it **WILL** you just have to help yourself.\n\nEDIT: I hope this helps, take care guys please! \nEDIT 2: Oh oh oh and don't forget to be patient!! That's really really important.\n"

I did struggle a bit in the beginning (not very athletic) but by the end of the race, I was really happy.

And for context I've done a ton of therapy and keep to a pretty strict routine to keep myself level... but sometime I slip. I wanted to share what helped me: \n\n\nMy anxiety, my panic attacks and my phobias are just my body's overreaction to stress. Panic over an intrusive thought does not mean that that thing is more valid, it is just my brain fixating on a fear, my fear of not having control over my wants and needs, my fear of irreversible change. Panic does not mean I want that thing to happen, and it does not mean I will act on these thoughts. All that this is, is my brains capability to blow a random thought into a fear, into an obsession... my brain does not simply let a thought go, it calculates it and sometimes sees it as a threat to my very being. And that's ok. It's just a thought. And thoughts can stay as just that... thoughts are not automatically actions and they are not automatically urges or wants... your brain comes up with nonsense all the time, every day... but if I do not look after my stress levels or care for myself when I've had a trauma, I will panic and my brain will latch on to the nearest fear... and run away with it. My fears are not desires, my fears are not predictions. They are just thoughts. And sometimes thoughts cause anxiety... panic does not validate these thoughts.. it merely makes it easier to obsess, makes it easier to fear your mind. It will pass. You will be fine. It will pass.

            "value": "I know this is long and I don't know if a lot of people will read this but I really just want to help. I had 2 panic attacks over the end of February and first day of March. I went to the doctor and had my blood work done, ekg, everything and they said I'm perfectly healthy. I workout 6 times a week. I had nothing to panic about! After that day, I started developing Harm OCD/intrusive thoughts about the recent news events that's been going on. It made me miserable, hopeless, and sometimes I would feel like \"what's the point?\" I wasn't depressed but I felt derealization. And then I went on to do CBT on my own (there are instructions online how to do CBT), went to a therapist, and I realized I felt better but I would still get anxiety attacks. My anxiety kept jumping off to something else after solving one problem. So I kept searching for a cure which led me to learn more about diet, magnesium, and vitamins.\n\nMAGNESIUM - 70% of Americans are Magnesium deficient and I deprived myself even more when I was trying to lose weight. I started taking Magnesium (Magnesium Citrate is better, I just started those yesterday) and it made me stop stressing about unnecessary things and obsessing about negative thoughts! I slept better at night and my body stopped twitching A LOT. I stopped getting anxiety attacks throughout the day and would only get them maybe 30 mins each day now but I'd move on. I suggest taking 250 mg a day. Check the Magnesium deficiency symptoms cause this may solve your problems.\n\nDIET - Your body needs a minimum amount of Carbs, Fats, and Protein to function. All this plays a role in your mood. These macronutrients are also important in developing serotonin and transferring them to your brain. Serotonin can be developed naturally, as long as you  track your diet. I suggest the \"myfitnesspal\" app. Track the amount of grams of protein, carbs, and fat that you are taking daily. AT LEAST meet the minimum. Your brain needs this to function properly! \n\nVITAMINS - so many of us are deprived of important vitamins. Take multivitamins and Fish Oil. The Fish Oil with Omega 3 have helped reduce my irritation and I feel less mood swings! There have been less instances where I felt derealization and not motivated. I started taking all these supplements and tracking my diet Sunday and I haven't felt it since! I used to feel it every day. \n\nI still get anxiety attacks here and there but it's gone down to like 10%. It was at 60% a week ago. And I heard from people that it never came back even years after as long as they made sure they ate healthy, exercised, and made sure to take time off from stress. It also takes your body a long time to get your deficiencies back up to normal level and will most likely take around 3 months. So be patient. For people who has had anxiety or depression their whole life, it may be that your body just isn't as efficient when it comes to absorbing these nutrients. I know this isn't the cure for everybody but I hope this can help others. There's ton of videos and articles about this online. Friends who had anxiety were real life examples for me as they got out of it. I just don't want anyone to go through anxiety, it sucks and feels like hell. If I can help even 1 person feel better, it'd make me really happy. \n\nDoctors don't even ask us about our diet. Neither do most therapists. That's because they don't know about Nutrition. They don't study wellness. This was an explanation by a doctor from UCLA (forgot his name) as to why we never get blood work done for our nutrients. Doctors study medicine so that's what they prescribe. CBT helped a lot for me and I think it has to be a mix of all THERAPY, EXERCISE, HEALTHY DIET, and REMEMBERING TO TAKE TIME OFF STRESS that can help you manage anxiety. Man this is long af lol, shoutout if you read this whole thing.\n\nEDIT: I also wanna give my dog, friends, family, and coworkers a shoutout. Surrounding yourself with kind, supportive people goes a long way. People that won't think you're crazy. People that are patient and won't judge you. If you got negative/bad influence people in your life, get yourself away from them. They just make things worse. Good luck to everyone on here. Everyone is dealing with something but we'll pull through! Also if you need someone to talk to or need advice or idk whatever, just message me. I'll do my best to help you get through. "

I don't want to get into the politics of it all, but I'm sure you can find that elsewhere on Reddit.\n\nSo this is just my story about how it has been going for me to voice my opinion on the matter, even when I get social anxiety. Just picking up the phone and having to talk to another human can be difficult sometimes \u2014 whether it be calling the store to find what time it closes or having to get support with technology \u2014 it makes me nervous just thinking about it. So you can imagine what it must feel like to want to voice my opinion \u2014 something I rarely do as it is because I worry about alienating people or making them upset. Especially when it comes to politics.\n\nThe main things that concerned me about calling my local representatives were... What do I say? My representative doesn't share the same political beliefs I do, so are they going to argue with me over the phone? Is there something special I need to do when they pick up? Maybe I should just hang up...\n\n**First off**, I used [this website](http://www.battleforthenet.com), which is an automated system that auto-dials your representatives for you, based on your ZIP code. Plus, it even gives you a basic script you can say. Literally, I said this word for word: \"Hello. I just wanted to call to express my opinion about net neutrality. So... um... yeah, I support 'Title Two' net neutrality rules and I would like you guys to publicly oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. I would really like if you guys would contact the FCC Chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. I don't believe we need legislation, so instead we really need you to stop the FCC from getting rid of the existing rules. So um... that's all. Thanks.\"\n\n**Secondly**, the dude on the other end of the line is just some staffer \u2014 often some college kid that takes phone calls for the representative's office. They were practically a robot themselves, and to be honest, they don't care to have a discussion about my political beliefs, even if they don't share them. There wasn't any argument, nor did they say much of anything at all.\n\n**And finally**, I didn't hang up! I stuck with it, and just read the script. When the lackey on the phone was done hearing me out, you can press star (*) on your phone, and boom \u2014 it hangs up on them, the automated system gave me a pat on the back (seriously, she says, \"You're doing great!\"), and it automatically calls the next representative.\n\n-----\n\nAt the end of the day, I felt relieved that I did it. I was so anxious about it at first! But when I spoke with these people, they didn't say much of anything, and I didn't feel scared because I realized their whole job is listening to people complain. The guy on the other end of the phone is just some dude who literally listens to calls all day and just forwards your comments to the man or woman in charge. The most that was said to me was when they asked for my address and ZIP code to confirm I lived in their district. That was it.\n\nLong story short: even with my anxiety issues, I found it to be easier than I expected, and it made me feel like I accomplished something.\n\nP.S. My first attempt was in the evening, after my representatives' offices had closed. I did this because I didn't want to talk to someone on the first try. So I just left them messages on their voicemail expressing my opinion, but I found that sometimes their voicemail was full. So I need to try again the next day, because otherwise, I'm not being heard.\n\n**tl;dr:** I expected to feel huge social anxiety calling my representatives to support net neutrality. Turned out to be the easiest thing ever, and made me feel like I made a huge accomplishment regarding my condition. It also means I actually did something that allowed me to voice my opinion, which made me feel good."

My mom went to the doctor early this week and they told her she had a high fever, pneumonia, and bronchitis. The doctor gave her medicine, and an inhaler to take, and the doctor told her to take OTC medicine for her cough. I don't like her doctor due to the fact he has used his patients as guinea pigs before and doesn't seem to care for the well-being of his patients. (One woman my mom knows is suing him because she almost died from him forcing her to take medicine she already took, but he didn't believe her despite her telling him). It's day four and her fever is still over 100\u00b0F despite her trying to get it down and she's been throwing up. I've been the main person keeping an eye on her while my dad goes to work. I even told my older brother to keep eye on her if I fall asleep for more than an hour (I just got better today from a sore, and extremely painful swollen left tonsil from the last 5 days and lost sleep due to it). But my brother pretty much told me f off without saying it as he continued playing his game. I'm so worried and scared, I don't know if I'm overreacting but I can't lose my mom, she's still young. \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22"

That's why I've never tried to win, as I grew up now I love playing football(soccer) and I've been playing since I remember myself (I would consider myself pretty good), but as the game goes on and we start winning, I start having this fear in my what the other team will do if I/we won and it kills all my enthusiasm to play it makes me feel scared in a way. Anyone has this same kind of fear, I really struggle to get past this, and usually if we do end up winning, I tend to be really quiet and try to avoid saying anything about the game or when someone gets pissed off, I feel bad."

I just can\u2019t help but feel that everyone around me is so much \u201ccooler\u201d. I go to a very small school so everyone pretty much knows each other, and everyone\u2019s always going to parties, has a lot of friends, drinks and smokes and stuff like that. \nI don\u2019t even want to do that stuff but I feel like it\u2019s so normal for 17 year olds to at least have had the experience of doing those things.  Also I feel like everyone is really talented at something, whether it\u2019s a sport, art or something. I\u2019m not good at anything; I have no purpose in life. Everyone\u2019s talking about the great colleges they wanna go to/have gotten into and I still don\u2019t know where I wanna go, idk if I\u2019ll even get into a state school.  Because of all these things I feel like I\u2019m behind everyone and just not as good as them in general:(\nI have my license but no car because my family doesn\u2019t have the money to buy another one and I don\u2019t have a job to save up money for one. I used to have one but the anxiety was too much so I quit. I\u2019m a senior in high school and the only one who still has to take the bus to school, or my mom drops me off. I\u2019ve also never had a boyfriend or even held a guy\u2019s hand. I have a couple friends but I don\u2019t go to parties or even really hang out with anyone outside of school because anxiety makes me assume everyone hates me and wouldn\u2019t wanna hang out with me. Like I said before, I\u2019m not talented at anything so I feel kinda worthless. I\u2019m also not pretty and I\u2019m kinda chubby, \u201cthick\u201d or whatever you wanna call it so it\u2019s not like I have that going for me lol.

I got through high school with a fairly good grades so i was able to get into a good college. On second year of college i had a mental break down, rendering me useless. I feel like i'm learning how to live my life again. In this past 2 years i wasn't able to pass any exam or subject.First year i wasn't able to be physically near college. I simply can't study, not only i can't concentrate or find any motivation. I feel completely crazy, i'm lost and i don't know how to help myself. I did manage to study for an hour or two for number of times but it was really bad. With constant stopping and i couldn't focus, my thoughts wander off and i forget what i'm doing. Actually only thinking about studying makes me want to run away, most of the time i can't even start. I really like knowing things, i'm really curious but with all the grades, the teachers and other students, there's a lot of pressure there. It's too much for me. I know that in the end the thing that will help me is keeping at it and being patient and a bit stubborn but i can't see this happening. Why is it so hard when i actually like it. \n\nFeel free to say what ever you want, i like different opinions. It shows me that it's not all that bad as i see it. \n\nEDIT: Thanks to all of you who shared their thoughts with me, i'm really grateful and i can feel my will for trying and fighting rising. I wish you all the best in dealing with your problems too. Cheers!"

And today I am feeling a bit on edge, but less so than yesterday, and I suspect tomorrow will be better, etc.\n\nDoes anyone else get this?\n\nDays where it is really good, and days where you are anxious seemingly out of nowhere?\n\nIt's like the brain is running on  some sort of cycle or something.

I either shut down completely, or scare them away because I open up to quickly. And past experiences have made me stop myself and be afraid to have a relationship. \n\nI basically have no filter when I talk (still working on that). It's one of my mayor flaws because I say shit I shoudn'y be saying, and end up in trouble or just in awkward situations. That being said, if I find something off about a situation, or something that I like about someone, I will voice it. This also is a problem, because I don't order my ideas before I voice them, and almost noone understands me. BUT, this dude tries to be patient with me, and he also has walked me through a panick attack.\n\nI also already asked him out last year, but I panicked when he said yes and immediately told him that a friend was also comming to see the movie with us.\n\nWell, yesterday I asked him again, he said yes. I almost had a panick attack on my own when he left, and almost text him again telling him that a friend was coming with us.\n\nBut I didn't.\n\nI calmed myself down. \n\nAnd I have a date with this dude.\n\nI can't believe I did this.\n\nEDIT: Wow, first I wanna thank everyone who has given me good wishes. I never thought this thread would get this big. I will update as soon as something about the date changes, when the date happens and after 'happenings'. :)"

I have anxiety about different things but one that is very strong for me is unwelcome noise.\n\nI grew up in a very quiet neighborhood where I had no problems falling asleep as it was really quiet at night. At some point - can't pinpoint when or why, but about 14 - I became very sensitive to certain noise, especially at night. For example the noise of a saw or any construction noise would just drive me crazy. At night it was enough when I could hear faint buzzing of music or a TV at low volume. I am not able to sleep and become super anxious and agressive. If the noise does not stop I feel like I am about to explode. I will have to put earplugs in and do everything possible to not hear it anymore. Sometimes it's a cycle, because as I get more anxious I get more sensitive to noise and that makes me more anxious. Ideally I want to live somewhere very, very quiet and always be able to control what I hear.\n\nHowever, I do not mind some other noises, even when they are very loud: storms, rain, trains driving by close, I don't care. I can fall asleep to that just fine.\n\nIt sounds so lame but noise from neighbours/outside has driven me into many a panic attack. Anyone else have this?"

I had to ask her to repeat her question because I was panicking and my eyes started to well up. She was very patient and understanding and ultimately penciled me in for about a week and a half from now. \n\nI've dreaded going to therapy my entire life and actively argue, fight, and cry against it like a child (I'm 22)...all because of the crippling anxiety I know I need it for. It's always killed me that the thing I need therapy most for is the thing holding me back from it. After I hung up I immediately broke down crying in the corner of my bed and my boyfriend told me how proud of me he was and that he'd be happy to go with me to my first appointment and wait for me. \n\nHopefully this can be some inspiration to anyone else with a similar issue.

But since there were no classes, I didn't see them for a while.\n\n So when I attempted to text, I kept asking myself, 'what if they hate you, what if they only pretended to like you and they're annoyed by your questions, what if they don't reply and you're being too needy' etc.\n\nLogically, I know that these worries make no sense because these people have never done anything to indicate that they might feel this way about me. So, like usually, I bullied (motivated?) myself  into texting anyway. \n\nWhen they didn't text back immidiately (which, hello, is totally understandable because they're not available 24/7) I kept working myself up.\n\nI'm so done with myself because, in my head, I know these worries are senseless and that I'm being ridiculous, but I still can't help myself.\n\nThis problem extends into other parts of my life. I'd have to be in an extremely dire situation to ask for help from anyone, even from my best friends. I'm always worrying that I'm being a bother and that I'll be dumped for being too needy. \n\nDo some of you experience similiar issues and have you found something that helps you cope?"

I felt like the most disgusting creature in the world. 24 years of living off my dad's money without even earning a single penny.  \nBut today I finally did it, I started dialing and didn't allow myself to stop, I called and got the address, and much to my own surprise I actually went there.

This made me feel bad and guilty for not doing things. But there was really some other issue there, a lack of the strength needed to push through the anxiety. I also feel a kind of anger about people saying that and apparently judging me for not doing things which I simply couldn't do.\n\nThe worst anxiety experience is struggling to do something when I don't have the strength to do it, and experiencing prolonged anxiety because of that. I'm pretty sure it's better to not even try or to give up quickly than to persevere at this, because if I'm not strong enough to do it I'll just spend time in a painful state and make myself feel worse. I think if unsuccessful, such prolonged experiences also reinforce anxiety and bad habits.\n\nBut, where does this strength to push through anxiety come from?

Within 5 minutes, I had calmed down, and I even asked a store assistant where they had the thing I was looking for! Turns out they were out, so I had to go to Publix. Now, Publix gives me anxiety attacks like no other store. It's huge, constantly crowded, and makes me feel very depersonalized and overwhelmed. But with my newfound confidence from stopping my anxiety attack, I walked in and thought to myself \"you can do this, just grab what you need and expect to wait in line for a bit, it's okay.\" I even shopped around for a bit because I was feeling so good! I only had to wait in line for a minute or two, and then I was outta there. All in all, a very successful day. \n\nNow, let me add that this did not come out of the blue. I've been slowly working at exposure therapy for months now, and I have had plenty more bad days than good days. But this? This makes me feel like it might all be working.

I think it really took a toll on my brother. Of course it did for me too but life goes on I believe. My brother has been online gaming since he was about 13, and hasn't stopped since. I thought it was a phase but now he's 21, going to be 22 in August this year. It worries me because he has way more interaction with his computer friends than he does with actual people. He will be screaming, laughing, having the time of his life on there. But when I try to talk to him I get \"eh\" or \"I don't know\" or maybe just a shrug. \nHe has never had a job before. He dropped out of school his second year of college. He's now going back to school for Pharmacy Tech. He basically wakes up at 10am, takes 3 showers a day, makes 3-4 20oz of coffee, two plain bagels, or 4 turkey sandwiches throughout the day, and sleeps probably at 3-4am. All during this time, also playing his video games. \nMy question is, is this just a social interaction issue? Was my parents divorce the cause of this? He had \"real friends\" in highschool. They come by now and then to pick my brother up to get dinner or stay the weekend with them. I'm just really concerned. His daily routines is what basically gets to me. It's not healthy. He's pale, can't walk for too long or else his back hurts (from sitting all day everyday), im just worried. Anything will help. Thank you! "

Long story short, my husband was 19 when he married me, and cheated, but I never caught him physically cheating, so I gave him another chance. He cheated for two and half years, until I caught him cheating, but he lied about everything. I had to find out all the shit he was doing on my own and would not confess to anything until I showed him proof. I should have left him... but here I am a year later and I haven't seen anything sketchy for a year now. \nWe were actually doing really good in May and June (it's July now), we're very happy, better than we've ever been. Unfortunately I found some sketchy acts that I'm not sure what to think of. \nI went through his chrome history, hoping to find nothing.  I found out that he was logging into his old email back in May a lot (he used this email to contact Craigslist ads, spam, and gave out all his physical features seeking out sex. He uses a different email for everything except xbox now. He only kept this email for Xbox purposes apparently). When I logged in through his phone, it logged in automatically, but the password is different and he claims he doesn't know the password, he claims his email has always just automatically logged him in...\nSo I go straight to his sent box. I opened the first email that didn't look like spam, and it showed his number in the sent box. My dumbass panicked and I did not get the senders or receivers actual email, I did not clearly see the message sent to him, I only saw his number and I saw that the email he responded to was asking for his number. \n\nI woke him up, and asked him with fear what was going on, of course he gets mad, puts a password on his phone, and goes back to sleep. When he woke up, I was at work, and he claimed he didn't see the email I was talking about but that he deleted everything and there's nothing to worry about. For a week straight we've been arguing about this damn email, and he has not changed his answers or his story at all... he claims he has no idea what I saw, and that he's sorry for deleting everything since it makes him look that much more suspicious. He claims he deleted it because he hates the fact that there's so much spam. BUT he knows the spam has been there and never deleted it before... he says he was only using that email for Xbox information, so why were there so many log ins at the same time?... and he's been telling me for months that \"if I go through his phone he's going to put a password on it\" but has never done so until now...\nIs this not sketchy af??\n\nSO...MY QUESTIONS ARE:\nis it possible that he did not send his phone number to someone? \nIs there someone that might know something about spam being able to send out personal information? \nIf he's lying, he's taking this to his grave.. but I'm done being naive... what are the possibilities that he's innocent?\n\nI need to mention that I've never really felt the way I have right now... for whatever reason... I have a gut feeling that's he's innocent... but maybe I'm in some hard core denial... my friend is convinced he's cheating... I don't know who to ask or where to go to find out the answer to my questions.\n\nPlease help me..\nIf I was vague, or if you have questions to make the situation more clear, please ask! I really need help now!!"
