European Union lies in the fact that the individual Member States frequently go to some lengths to deny the Commission the resources it needs to exercise effective control over the various

European Union - rather as we have in Germany, with the system for sharing between individual Länder."},{"classification":"en","value":"Forgive me if I do not comment on the question of British beef."},{"classification":"en","value":"Four years ago in Northern Ireland we had over 226 mushroom growers, today we have 40 - an 80% drop in those involved in the industry."},{"classification":"en","value":"From a psychological point of view, the destruction of critical infrastructures leads to a loss of public confidence in the European Union."},{"classification":"en","value":"Furthermore, Amendment No 16 concerning the identification of the ingredients of generic drugs is in order, as that will promote a more judicious use of them, that is to say, generic substitution."},{"classification":"en","value":"Furthermore, account was taken of the brain drain from regions of the world such as Africa where there is an acute demand for human resources in the health sector."},{"classification":"en","value":"Furthermore, paragraph 11 of the report talks about promoting an 'actively European mindset' among EU citizens."},{"classification":"en","value":"Furthermore, we cannot agree to an economic steering body as a counterpart of the ECB."},{"classification":"en","value":"Given the instability and the fragility of the most highly populated country in Africa, where the majority of the population suffer from poverty, this motion for a resolution may act as a foundation for strengthening the political dialogue between the European Union and Nigeria, and for a more detailed study aimed at finding viable short- and long-term solutions to end this violence and to re-establish a lasting peace."},{"classification":"en","value":"Harmonisation of these waiting times is acceptable if it is due to a concern for the legal correctness of the procedure, but I fear that it may be inefficient and instil fear for both material and political reasons."},{"classification":"en","value":"Having said that, however, I do agree that this common position is an important step forward in the direction of improving and monitoring the health of European citizens, and I think we should vote for it."},{"classification":"en","value":"Having said that, this is a field in which we have significant active interests, and some of our Member States have already pointed this out to us."},{"classification":"en","value":"He was one of the main exponents of the conservative revolution in Germany and certainly, as pointed out by the international press today, an important author of European political thinking and twentieth century literature."},{"classification":"en","value":"Hence my plea, Mr President."},{"classification":"en","value":"Hence, I am clearly a party man."},{"classification":"en","value":"Here we see a country where everyone, from the highest to the lowest level, is doing everything possible to help and to see that anything that can still be saved is saved."},{"classification":"en","value":"Here, the procedures in the Member States are utterly different."},{"classification":"en","value":"How can the Commission solve this?"},{"classification":"en","value":"How can we explain that we have the euro - a common currency which is not common to all - but at the same time we are implementing reforms which not even we are able to comprehend or justify."},{"classification":"en","value":"How codecision will eventually be hammered out in terms of relations between Parliament, the Council and Member States in decision-making on humanitarian activities is something that needs to be discussed further and perhaps negotiated."},{"classification":"en","value":"How do you intend to make our people understand that, today like always, immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which is, and will remain, essential in the context of population?"},{"classification":"en","value":"How is it possible not to shudder when thinking of our young people, our young women and our young mothers?"},{"classification":"en","value":"How successful are we in fact in pointing the European Union's transport systems and private households towards sustainability?"},{"classification":"en","value":"However it should be crystal clear from the relevant scientific advice that the Scientific Committee did not recommend specific time limitations for the transport of animals as a tool to improve their welfare."},{"classification":"en","value":"However, I also said that it is of course a neighbour country and that is why it is especially important to take issues such as those raised by Graham Watson, Christopher Beazley and others very seriously."},{"classification":"en","value":"However, I was wondering, in view of the subject of our debate - human rights in the European Union - whether Mr Van den Broek, who is already following a number of dossiers, is really the competent Commissioner in this matter."},{"classification":"en","value":"However, Jacques Santer is not to blame for that, as with the best will in the world he cannot intervene in his Commissioners' individual departments."},{"classification":"en","value":"However, because of the increasing importance of the Internet as an international organization, it is impossible, both in practice and also in law, to take action against companies or individuals who are proceeding in accordance with the laws of their home country while acting outside of EU laws or national regulations."},{"classification":"en","value":"However, because of the specific tasks assigned to ENISA and the pressing need for its establishment, the Commission has not stood in the way of a first-reading agreement between the legislators."},{"classification":"en","value":"However, for a truly mine-free world, it is vital that we go beyond this and call for a comprehensive ban that covers all types of mines, including anti-tank mines and fragmentation bombs."},{"classification":"en","value":"However, the Council reiterates its strong resistance to the imposition of extra-territorial legislation as a means of pursuing these objectives."},{"classification":"en","value":"However, the main protests are coming from the car industry."},{"classification":"en","value":"However, this reduction should focus primarily on companies that are uncompetitive; unfortunately, the reality is often different."},{"classification":"en","value":"However, we must seize this opportunity!"},{"classification":"en","value":"However, we recognise the difficulties he faced with certain governments."},{"classification":"en","value":"However, we welcome the fact that employment and the environment have been taken into consideration to a greater extent and that progress has also been made in the fight against international crime, that decision-making procedures have been simplified and that the European Parliament will have more clout in terms of legislation."},{"classification":"en","value":"However, what is even more important is the fact that the proposed financing instrument takes account of the calls by the European Parliament and of the Council for the strengthening of the response capacity in the civil protection sector in Europe."},{"classification":"en","value":"Humanitarian aid must make it possible to look forward to the time when people no longer need it."},{"classification":"en","value":"I agree with him that the estimates in front of us are critical in that they deal with Parliament's preparations for enlargement."},{"classification":"en","value":"I agree with that completely."},{"classification":"en","value":"I agree with the joint Resolution and with the objective of supporting the demands of the Saharawi people and, above all, their demand for self-determination ― which they have still not achieved after thirty years ― but also that this issue must always be balanced with the problem of security and stability that we are facing on the southern border of the European Union, and that we must take account of the Morocco factor, a country of 30 million people, where there is a latent danger of Islamic regression."},{"classification":"en","value":"I also asked about the waste ..."},{"classification":"en","value":"I also have doubts whether the authors of these resolutions have really taken the trouble to find out exactly what subcritical tests are, for they are tests in which no chain reactions ensue, in which no radioactive substances are released above the tolerance limits."},{"classification":"en","value":"I also want to point out that the concept of a safe third country will make it virtually impossible for refugees to enter the European Union legally in future."},{"classification":"en","value":"I also wish to express my gratitude to the Court of Auditors, which has highlighted two main groups of reasons."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am a great supporter of having interim assessments or current assessments and modifications of the fisheries treaties which the Community signs, especially when it comes to the developing countries."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am afraid that the Irish 'no' will encourage rather than discourage existing tendencies to renationalise some common policies by prolonging the juridical vacuum the EU finds itself in since the rejection of the constitutional treaty."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am also sure that these countries will be a perfect bridge for developing our relations with Russia, Ukraine and Belarus."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am calling upon the Commission and the European Parliament to give a firm response to these events."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am concerned about statements to the effect that the EU should be able to intervene anywhere in the world where there are threats to the Union' s security, interests and values."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am convinced that the 'carrot' rather than the 'stick' approach will achieve a better result at the present state of development of national inspectorates."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am convinced that the most productive approach to Belarus will be one based on pragmatism."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am happy to say that the EU institutions and bodies have shown that in general, they are keen to resolve issues that I bring to their attention."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am happy to say that there is a growing awareness of the need for much greater coordination, in both the European Council and the General Affairs Council."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am not offering my congratulations as a mere formality."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am obliged to say this, quite simply."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am quite sure that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will miss you."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am sorry if I spoke too quickly; I was anxious not to take up too much time."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am therefore completely behind the report and hope that it will be adopted in its entirety without the need for any amendments."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am thinking, for example, of the oil crisis."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am very much afraid, however, that there are still many who are trying to hinder the work of this office."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am very pleased that we actually managed to follow the way pointed by the European Parliament at the Councils in Nice and Göteborg."},{"classification":"en","value":"I am very pleased that we have finally got a female Trade Commissioner and the first female British Commissioner."},{"classification":"en","value":"I announced to you then my intention to propose as soon as possible for approval in the European Commission the White Paper on renewable energy sources and the framework programme for energy."},{"classification":"en","value":"I appeal to parliamentarians to sign the declaration in favour of the Treaty on the controlarms.org website."},{"classification":"en","value":"I believe here, Commissioner, that we need to pass from evolution to revolution in the field of simplification; all this is not so that we can abolish cohesion, which is a basic policy of the European Union, but so that we can improve it and make it more effective."},{"classification":"en","value":"I believe that a constructive approach would be more expedient: let us value the positive steps taken by the Committee of the Regions in answer to our earlier proposals, appreciate their cooperative attitude and give them a vote of confidence, trusting them to continue their work in a similar spirit, as we are preparing to do just that in respect of all the other institutions."},{"classification":"en","value":"I believe that a unanimous vote by this House on the matter would greatly hasten the subsequent conferences in Ottawa."},{"classification":"en","value":"I believe that the agreement that has been reached on support for the European Union's energy policy in the long term, providing incentives in the short term for the recovery of the economy, achieves both goals."},{"classification":"en","value":"I believe that this manner of proceeding comes very close to the limits of our Rules of Procedure and, with all due respect to my very good friend Mrs André-Léonard, the situation of the press in Algeria is considerably better than in other countries, such as Tunisia, which is in the papers this morning, and perhaps also her own country."},{"classification":"en","value":"I believe that we should be grateful for that."},{"classification":"en","value":"I believe that, in general, established transporters of animals are licensed and authorised and comply with best welfare standards - because it is in their vital interests to do so: they need to transport animals to arrive in good condition so that they meet the needs of those who are purchasing."},{"classification":"en","value":"I believe this only has to do with the e-commerce directive, so I hope the Commissioner will take another look at the issue."},{"classification":"en","value":"I call on my fellow Members and also on national associations to join the citizens of Slovakia in their protest and to also sign the written declaration and in that way support our protest."},{"classification":"en","value":"I call upon the UK Government to abandon its previous resistance to taking part in such a process."},{"classification":"en","value":"I can only comment on the main aspects of the changes here."},{"classification":"en","value":"I changed the report, and subsequently 126 amendments were tabled."},{"classification":"en","value":"I commented on this earlier, but also pointed out its limitations."},{"classification":"en","value":"I could not describe the European mission patrolling the waters in the region as anything other than a resounding success, but this task only involves treating the effects of the 'disease', and not at all the disease itself."},{"classification":"en","value":"I deeply regret this delay and, like my fellow Members, I hope that you will be able to remedy it as soon as possible."},{"classification":"en","value":"I dispute the notion that the EU can bestow and regulate fundamental rights."},{"classification":"en","value":"I do find it odd, though, that the European Parliament sets so little store by its own legislative work."},{"classification":"en","value":"I do not believe that you are proposing that Social Security and pensions should become a European competence - that would go further than what we are saying - but it is important that it be linked to our demographic situation and our future, above all in relation to immigration."},{"classification":"en","value":"I do not fully agree with Recital T of the report."},{"classification":"en","value":"I do not know what they can think."},{"classification":"en","value":"I do not object; I do not hold strong views on the subject and I certainly do not want to upset my good friend Mr Martínez, but there is a danger that we could create inferior subjects and superior subjects."},{"classification":"en","value":"I do not see significant progress being made by Russia, but we shall persevere."},{"classification":"en","value":"I do not think that we can accept their procedures."},{"classification":"en","value":"I feel it is important that we are able to discuss these topics at the large-scale Roma conference being organised on 16 September, and I hope that the question of social inclusion of the Roma will be put on the agenda of the European Council both separately and as part of the social agenda."},{"classification":"en","value":"I fully agree with this."},{"classification":"en","value":"I fully understand why consumers expect us to take speedy, comprehensive and effective action, appropriate in terms of the gravity of the matter, to give them the necessary guarantees that the crisis will be resolved in both the short and the long-term."},{"classification":"en","value":"I have heard what Members are saying on that matter."},{"classification":"en","value":"I have some critical questions relating to whether the present programme is capable of tackling this problem adequately."},{"classification":"en","value":"I have to say that the shortage is dropping, because last year, it was EUR 43.7 million."},{"classification":"en","value":"I hope that the ambition shown by the Irish presidency, culminating in the draft treaty, can now be fulfilled in time for the Amsterdam Summit."},{"classification":"en","value":"I hope we will meet again soon."},{"classification":"en","value":"I hope you will not take that off my one minute, of course!"},{"classification":"en","value":"I hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that our recommendation, on which we shall vote tomorrow, can prove an inspiration to the Gothenburg Summit and particularly will move the Council to involve the European Parliament in a more structural way in future in the discussion on the open coordination method on pensions."},{"classification":"en","value":"I naturally hope that these will be adopted by this House."},{"classification":"en","value":"I need to point out here, and I shall explain why in just a moment, that some of the ideas formulated in the Morillon report relate to initiatives which have already been set in motion and are being examined by the competent bodies of the Union."},{"classification":"en","value":"I personally oppose the building of new atomic power plants."},{"classification":"en","value":"I propose we vote from 56 to 28."},{"classification":"en","value":"I shall now pass on to other points, Mr President, Commissioner."},{"classification":"en","value":"I should also like to comment on simplification and better regulation."},{"classification":"en","value":"I should like to remind the House that Parliament adopted 3 amendments at first reading."},{"classification":"en","value":"I should like to take this opportunity to give my sincere thanks to Commissioner Rehn, too, for his commitment to this region; as it is very important to have someone with sensitivity towards the region, someone who knows that its needs have to be met appropriately, and that that includes a pan-European approach."},{"classification":"en","value":"I should point out that it is not a real privilege but a legitimate and ancestral right enabling farmers to use some of their crops for seeding purposes."},{"classification":"en","value":"I therefore ask that while helping others, for instance in Africa, we do not forget those waiting for our assistance close by."},{"classification":"en","value":"I therefore think that we need to put the lid on this tendency simply to continue in our old ways."},{"classification":"en","value":"I think it essential that these demands should also apply to vehicles from non-EU countries which use our roads."},{"classification":"en","value":"I think that because we are at the first reading stage here, I do not need to go into each amendment and explain in detail why it cannot be accepted."},{"classification":"en","value":"I think that these terrible statistics, Madam President, should lead us to think profoundly about the role of our Parliament, which I do not see as a court that punishes and pontificates, but as an institution that has its own effective strategies for seeking, by mutual agreement with our partners and on the basis of dialogue, cooperation and good practice, solutions for eradicating this process."},{"classification":"en","value":"I think that this, in conjunction with recruitment of contractual agents, will allow us to achieve flexibility with the required degree of protection."},{"classification":"en","value":"I venture to doubt that that will add up to a debate."},{"classification":"en","value":"I very much hope that the Mediterranean programme and the enlargement process may be seen as complementary and not conflicting."},{"classification":"en","value":"I want to make myself clear."},{"classification":"en","value":"I want to retain this and would not like to see everything forced into line in Europe."},{"classification":"en","value":"I was especially critical of the agreement when it came to the issue of young doctors."},{"classification":"en","value":"I was present during the gestation of this legislation and hope to be there tomorrow for the final delivery, as it were, of the new consumer credit baby!"},{"classification":"en","value":"I welcome Mr CFSP' s taking office."},{"classification":"en","value":"I welcome Mr Falconer's suggestion that it be referred to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities for amendment."},{"classification":"en","value":"I welcome Parliament’s position on regional policy per se, but I also believe that we must have sustainable development."},{"classification":"en","value":"I welcome the active involvement of the social partners, as well as the input received from other stakeholders."},{"classification":"en","value":"I will be quite frank in saying that I have a number of difficulties with the Schörling report."},{"classification":"en","value":"I will comment on six groups of amendments."},{"classification":"en","value":"I will stop there, because you have already discussed that at length this morning."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would also like to welcome, along with the Commissioner who is present and those who are absent, the fact that we are witnessing a change in perspective."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would also remind you of Amendments Nos 24 and 25 which the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats have submitted and which will be voted on tomorrow."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would ask people to bear in mind that citizenship is not defined by the passport you hold."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would ask you all to play your parts in this, in order that this important institution, which is to represent the European Union as a whole to the outside world, may take concrete form as soon as possible."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would be very happy to come back to you with concrete proposals once we have the concrete legislative documents."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would like to express the Liberal Group's appreciation of the agreement between Mr Holbrooke and Milosevic, with its provision for observers and so on. Commissioner van den Broek did however say that military withdrawal is not yet complete, and referred to Belgrade's imposition of tighter restrictions on the media and free speech."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would like to finish by saying that we should not lose sight in all this of the fact that the responsibility for urban transport systems remains with the towns and cities of Europe."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would like to make yet another remark."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would like to remind him that when Prince Victor Emmanuel was exiled from his native country he was four years old which, in my opinion, makes it unlikely that he could have invaded Greece."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would like to repeat my willingness and Parliament's willingness to cooperate in the future in order to reach a satisfactory conclusion in terms of this bridging budget, bearing in mind, as far as possible, both your and Parliament's priorities."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would like to request two things, Mr President."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would like to tell the House about one of my dreams."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would like to thank my fellow Members for voting in favour of this report."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would like to thank you, my fellow Members, the Commissioner and our colleagues from the Pan-African Parliament."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would reply to Mr Sacrédeus that the Council is not really qualified in any way to express an opinion on the question he has posed."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would say the clear and unqualified condemnation by all governments of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations committed by whomsoever and wherever is a very important element, and it is a strong push, given that this agreement has been negotiated for nearly ten years."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would thank Mr Méndez de Vigo both for his work within the Convention and for his vision of the role he wishes to see the European Parliament play, a role indeed that the Convention will not be able to perform but that Parliament is in a position to assume."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would therefore draw the attention of the Commission once more to an own-initiative report - which it so happens was drawn up by me, but was approved by plenary session - in which we point out that, if the administration of agricultural expenditure in the new and existing Member States concerned is not in order, the Commission must suspend advance payments much more often until the system is in order, instead of carrying out controls after the event and imposing penal charges."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would therefore like to take this opportunity to say a few words about the elections, the preparations for the post-Bonn period and future EU-Afghanistan relations."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would urge the Council to freeze the upgrade of relations with Israel until a complete and permanent cease-fire has been agreed by all sides and Israel grants unrestricted access for humanitarian aid."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would, however, like to request that the vote be deferred, if only out of a desire for consistency with this morning' s events, and also because it would be fitting for a resolution as important as this to be voted in by more than 40 or 50 Members."},{"classification":"en","value":"I would, nevertheless, like to take this opportunity to stress a fundamental concept: the reform is not and never has been a political end in itself, to be taken out of its wide institutional and political context, that is."},{"classification":"en","value":"Ideally I would have preferred a total ban in view of the very high probability that they cause indiscriminate damage to health."},{"classification":"en","value":"If Mrs Glase and her group want to reduce tax in order to make undeclared work less profitable, this is as good as saying that they want to legalise the economic calculations behind undeclared work and make them the general rule."},{"classification":"en","value":"If a good policy is to come from this good report, I hope that we can convince the Council together with the Commission that its content must be put into effect politically."},{"classification":"en","value":"If it is the case that Sweden's health authorities decide the risks of salmonella infection spreading in Sweden are too great, and, in spite of the fact that you say it is not allowed, they introduce random inspections or regular routine inspections, as mentioned in Mr Wibe's question, what will happen then?"},{"classification":"en","value":"If so, those developing countries must then authorise them themselves, but how can they do this if they ..."},{"classification":"en","value":"If that is the case, detainees will be able to choose to plead guilty, even if they are not, in order to escape the death penalty."},{"classification":"en","value":"If the Commission forwards a communication to the European Parliament, the latter should at the very least produce a response to the contents."},{"classification":"en","value":"If the Commission is not planning such a communication, why is this, and how can the Commission then guarantee transparent and efficient use of the ESF?"},{"classification":"en","value":"If the United Kingdom or Ireland or both countries make such a request, the Council will discuss it and take a decision. Under Article 4 of the Schengen Protocol, this requires a unanimous decision on the part of the 13 Schengen members and the applicant or applicants."},{"classification":"en","value":"If they were not global, we would not be affected in the way we are, so we cannot forget that our leadership, our initiatives and our decisions should be followed by a high degree of consensus around our positions with the other partners and the other players."},{"classification":"en","value":"If we vote and decide on this report today on the 50th anniversary of the foundation of UNICEF, this act would represent a future guarantee that we will pay particular attention to the problems of children in the activities of the European Parliament."},{"classification":"en","value":"In 1994, the Commission asked all non-OECD countries what control procedures, if any, they wanted to be applied to the shipment of waste on the green list."},{"classification":"en","value":"In 1997 Mr Brown established five famous so-called tests before we could adjudge sterling's accession to the single currency."},{"classification":"en","value":"In 2003, the European Union will have streamlined key policy coordination instruments."},{"classification":"en","value":"In Europe and many countries there is now a real wage problem, frequently forcing workers to increase rather than reduce working hours, by working overtime."},{"classification":"en","value":"In Iran, the critical dialogue has clearly been interpreted in such a way as to convey the impression that we in the EU are now better placed to understand and accept their oppressive regime."},{"classification":"en","value":"In Sweden, we have combined unemployment targets and employment targets."},{"classification":"en","value":"In a mission during the next weeks, the Commission will assess the situation and the possibility of assisting with further measures addressing some of the root causes of the conflict."},{"classification":"en","value":"In accordance with Rule 108(3) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received one motion for a resolution at the end of this debate."},{"classification":"en","value":"In addition we risk making enlargement to the eastern and central European countries intolerable, if public opinion feels that the latter are taking away from us what is rightfully ours."},{"classification":"en","value":"In addition, forced labour and child conscription into the army are part of everyday life."},{"classification":"en","value":"In all these areas, we rely, of course, on the knowledge of the agencies."},{"classification":"en","value":"In exactly the same way we find it very disappointing that we were unable to include and regulate genetically modified additives, which would really have signalled how seriously we take the subject of consumer protection."},{"classification":"en","value":"In fact, although the conservation of cetaceans is subject to protection under the 'Habitats' Directive, the measures contained therein have not proven sufficient to guarantee an appropriate level of protection."},{"classification":"en","value":"In fact, is there a future for this project or should we now be rethinking the whole initiative?"},{"classification":"en","value":"In fact, this amendment does no more than reflect in legislation what has long been the practice of most airlines."},{"classification":"en","value":"In general, I am, as I say, well satisfied with the proposal by the Conciliation Committee and hope and expect it to be adopted."},{"classification":"en","value":"In its communication the European Commission offers Member States the opportunity of taking support measures to help ship owners achieve this."},{"classification":"en","value":"In my view, the Directive takes due account of humanitarian concerns about the deportation process, notably through the introduction of a maximum detention period of six months."},{"classification":"en","value":"In my view, what we should be expecting from this presidency is not that it should manage to resolve all the problems currently facing the European Union - something which would be physically impossible, for reasons of time - but that, by shaping wills and achieving consensus, it should be capable of giving a boost to the process of European integration, which is now at a critical point in its timetable."},{"classification":"en","value":"In other words, if we work together, the total should be greater than the sum of the parts."},{"classification":"en","value":"In other words, the Netherlands Presidency implies, in a way, that liberalising the market will automatically create jobs."},{"classification":"en","value":"In other words, the trend is changing in my country: the manufacture, stockpiling and export of these weapons were approved by previous governments."},{"classification":"en","value":"In other words, they might think that such a directive would have a serious and positive social dimension."},{"classification":"en","value":"In our view, there is no difficulty."},{"classification":"en","value":"In particular, I was pleasantly surprised in Bonn by the constructive attitude being taken by the business world."},{"classification":"en","value":"In particular, he has given no clear commitment to the withdrawal of security forces which are engaged in repression."},{"classification":"en","value":"In politics, there is a tendency to evaluate any given issue depending on whether you come to it from the Left or the Right."},{"classification":"en","value":"In reply to some of the other remarks made by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I warn against throwing around quotes which are very difficult to verify."},{"classification":"en","value":"In reply to the call for new structures let me say that in my view we do not so much need to create new structures as to integrate the environment in all regional assistance measures and we will seriously endeavour to do precisely that."},{"classification":"en","value":"In response to this, which I believe is due to the business model that has been put forward so far and the level of greed that we have in Europe, I think that with this future in mind, we need to put people first."},{"classification":"en","value":"In several countries there is a saying related to alcohol consumption, according to which it should be the exclusive concern of men."},{"classification":"en","value":"In short, it is not a matter of ordering action but of encouraging it."},{"classification":"en","value":"In short, the report which will be presented to plenary tomorrow specifies in detail many areas in which the Romanian authorities must continue to make efforts."},{"classification":"en","value":"In some parts of the Union - and I am quite willing to cite the United Kingdom - we are not doing as well as we could."},{"classification":"en","value":"In supporting it, however, we must not repeat the mistakes of the past, by which I mean, primarily, that we have to give the market more of a chance."},{"classification":"en","value":"In that context and in that part of the world, this is something that must be taken into account."},{"classification":"en","value":"In the Convention, I endeavoured to make the EU more social, since a social Europe is what the public rightly expect."},{"classification":"en","value":"In the European Union, someone is diagnosed with it every two and a half minutes."},{"classification":"en","value":"In the absence of a prudent stimulus to productive employment from Germany, I suspect that there cannot be a sure recovery from the economic recession."},{"classification":"en","value":"In the codecision procedure for the amendment of the \"Television without frontiers' directive, Parliament approved an amendment aimed at guaranteeing public access to specific sporting events of special importance through open-access television throughout the whole European Union."},{"classification":"en","value":"In the context of the current budgetary perspectives it would, however, have been difficult to achieve much more in this respect."},{"classification":"en","value":"In the course of the coming months, the questions and problems raised here should find proper responses from the Commission."},{"classification":"en","value":"In this context, I should like, en passant, to apprise you of one fact, which is not without interest, because unfortunately it is never adequately taken into consideration in the discussion: the Austrian railways are the only ones to have increased their share of the freight market in the last few years."},{"classification":"en","value":"In this context, the Union urged Turkey - as we have done in the bilateral meetings with Turkey - to avoid any kind of threat, source of friction or actions that could damage good neighbourly relations and the peaceful settlement of disputes."},{"classification":"en","value":"In this important space, we need to develop a number of initiatives."},{"classification":"en","value":"In this regard, I would like to reiterate the need to bring into this debate the concept of a European language of universal
