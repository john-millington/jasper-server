Margolus (born 1955) is a Canadian-American physicist and computer scientist, known for his work on cellular automata and reversible computing. He is a research affiliate with the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Margolus was one of the organizers of a seminal research meeting on the connections between physics and computation theory, held on Mosquito Island in 1982. He is known for inventing the block cellular automaton and the Margolus neighborhood for block cellular automata, which he used to develop cellular automaton simulations of billiard-ball computers. In the same work, Margolus also showed that the billiard ball model could be simulated by a second order cellular automaton, a different type of cellular automaton invented by his thesis advisor, Edward Fredkin. These two simulations were among the first cellular automata that were both reversible (able to be run backwards as well as forwards for any number of time steps, without ambiguity) and universal (able to simulate the operations of any computer program); . A different mechanism for defining reversible universal cellular automata, by embedding d-dimensional irreversible automata into (d + 1)-dimensional reversible automata, was described earlier by . this combination of properties is important in low-energy computing, as it has been shown that the energy dissipation of computing devices may be made arbitrarily small if and only if they are reversible. In connection with this issue, Margolus and his co-author Lev B. Levitin proved the Margolus–Levitin theorem showing that the speed of any computer is limited by the fundamental laws of physics to be at most proportional to its energy use; this implies that ultra-low-energy computers must run more slowly than conventional computers. With Tommaso Toffoli, Margolus developed the CAM-6 cellular automaton simulation hardware, which he extensively described in his book with Toffoli, Cellular Automata Machines (MIT Press, 1987), and with Tom Knight he developed the \"Flattop\" integrated circuit implementation of billiard-ball computation. He has also done pioneering research on the reversible quantum gate logic needed to support quantum computers. Margolus received his Ph.D. in physics in 1987 from MIT, under the supervision of Edward Fredkin. He founded and was chief scientist for Permabit, an information storage device company.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"\"'''Don't You Think This Outlaw Bit's Done Gone Out of Hand'''\" is a song written and recorded by American country music artist Waylon Jennings and is based heavily on a true story.

Prussian Nights describes the Red Army's march across East Prussia, and focuses on the traumatic acts of rape and murder that Solzhenitsyn witnessed as a participant in that march. Originally it was Chapter 8 of his huge autobiographic poem ''Dorozhen'ka (The Road) that he wrote in 1947 as a sharashka'' (scientific research camp) inmate. The original poem did not survive, but in 1950–1951, working in a hard labour camp near Ekibastuz, Solzhenitsyn restored Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 (The Feast of the victors) as separate poems. The poem is in trochaic tetrameter, \"in imitation of, and argument with the most famous Russian war poem, Aleksandr Tvardovsky's Vasili Tyorkin.\" The poem is based on Solzhenitsyn's own experiences – he was a captain of an artillery battery which formed a part of the Second Belorussian Front, which invaded East Prussia from south-east in January 1945. The Soviet offensive followed the path of the disastrous offensive by the Russian Second Army under Alexander Samsonov during World War I; the comparison with the Soviet victorious offensive is one of the underlying themes of the poem. Solzhenitsyn was arrested soon afterwards, in early February, three weeks after the offensive had started. His arrest was partly due to his critique of the treatment of civilians. In the poem he recalls the pillages, rapes and murders committed by the Soviet troops taking their revenge on German civilians, the events which later resulted in the first part of the German exodus from Eastern Europe, Solzhenitsyn composed the poem—about twelve thousand lines and over fifty pages long—while he was serving a sentence of hard labor in Gulag camps. He is rumored to have written a few lines of the poem each day on a bar of soap and memorized them while using it. He also wrote about how composing this poem helped him to survive his imprisonment: \"I needed a clear head, because for two years I had been writing a poem—a most rewarding poem that helped me not to notice what was being done to my body. Sometimes, while standing in a column of dejected prisoners, amidst the shouts of guards with machine guns, I felt such a rush of rhymes and images that I seemed to be wafted overhead . . . At such moments I was both free and happy . . . Some prisoners tried to escape by smashing a car through the barbed wire. For me there was no barbed wire. The head count of prisoners remained unchanged, but I was actually away on a distant flight.\" He wrote down the poem between the 1950s and 1970s. He made a recording of it in 1969; it was not published in Russian until 1974 when it was published in Paris, France. A German translation was done by Nikolaus Ehlert in 1976, and it was officially first translated into English by Robert Conquest in 1977. Critical reaction was mixed. The New York Times reviewed it thus: \"a clumsy and disjointed 1400 line narrative which can be called poetry only because it is written in meter and rhyme. Sent to any publishing house of émigré Russian journal bearing any name but Solzhenitsyn's, it would be rejected unhesitatingly.\" A reviewer in New York Review of Books called Prussian Nights, \"for all its shortcomings, a powerful and moving work.

He migrated to Caius College, Cambridge in May 1574 aged 18 before finally taking his degree at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1576-77 aged 20 or 21. He obtained his Master of Arts degree in 1580 and took a Bachelor of Divinity in 1593. Braddock was a Fellow of Christ's College from 1579 to 1587. Braddock was sympathetic to the Puritan leanings in the Church of England. In 1579 he and the other Fellows of Christ's College signed a protest on behalf of Hugh Broughton, who had been deprived of his Fellowship by Dr. Edward Hawford, the Master. Braddock's signature can also be found on a letter from the Fellows to Lord Burghley thanking him for mediating in a dispute involving the Vice-Chancellor, Dr John Copcot against the non-conformist Sampson Sheffield for preaching an \"erroneous and scandalous\" sermon. He was ordained a Deacon in London in March 1580 and a priest at Ely in April 1580 and Proctor in 1584. He was incorporated at the University of Oxford in 1584. In March 1588 he was elected Headmaster of Reading School and resigned that post in April 1589. During his tenure at Reading one of his students was William Laud. Braddock's ecclesiastical appointments included being vicar of Stanstead Abbots in Hertfordshire from 1590 to 1593, where he married Elizabeth Graves in August 1593; Rector of Navenby in Lincolnshire from 1593 to 1599; and Rector of Wittersham in Kent to his death in 1607. Today Braddock is mostly remembered for his translation into Latin of Apologia pro Ecclesia Anglicana, the confutation in six parts by John Jewel, Bishop of Salisbury against the criticisms of the Lollard dissenter Thomas Harding. Braddock's translation was published in Geneva in 1600 and was undertaken that foreign scholars and divines might be able to follow the controversy which Jewel's Apologia had caused since its first publication in 1562. Braddock dedicated his work to John Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury, ‘who has filled the diocese with learned men’. Braddock is also remembered for having given books from his own library to the library of Christ's College, where he had studied. A book inscribed with Braddock's signature from his library and with marginalia in his own hand was formerly in the Glenn Christodoulou Collection.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Phytocoris fenestratus is a species of plant bugs in the family Miridae.

John Carnell, who became Novae Terraes editor in 1939, renamed it New Worlds that year. He was instrumental in turning it into a professional publication in 1946 and was the first editor of the new incarnation. It became the leading UK science fiction magazine; the period to 1960 has been described by science fiction historian Mike Ashley as the magazine's \"Golden Age\". Carnell joined the British Army in 1940 following the outbreak of the Second World War, and returned to civilian life in 1946. He negotiated a publishing agreement for the magazine with Pendulum Publications, but only three issues of New Worlds were subsequently produced before Pendulum's bankruptcy in late 1947. A group of science fiction fans formed a company called Nova Publications to revive the magazine; the first issue under their management appeared in mid-1949. New Worlds continued to appear on a regular basis until issue 20, published in early 1953, following which a change of printers led to a hiatus in publication. In early 1954, when Maclaren & Sons acquired control of Nova Publications, the magazine returned to a stable monthly schedule. New Worlds was acquired by Roberts & Vinter in 1964, when Michael Moorcock became editor. By the end of 1966 financial problems with their distributor led Roberts & Vinter to abandon New Worlds, but with the aid of an Arts Council grant obtained by Brian Aldiss, Moorcock was able to publish the magazine independently. He featured a good deal of experimental and avant-garde material, and New Worlds became the focus of the \"New Wave\" of science fiction. Reaction among the science fiction community was mixed, with partisans and opponents of the New Wave debating the merits of New Worlds in the columns of fanzines such as Zenith-Speculation. Several of the regular contributors during this period, including Brian Aldiss, J. G. Ballard, Thomas M. Disch and Moorcock himself became major names in the field. By 1970 Moorcock was too deeply in debt to be able to continue with the magazine, and it became a paperback quarterly after issue 201. The title has been revived multiple times, with Moorcock's direct involvement or approval; by 2012, 21 additional issues had appeared in various formats, including several anthologies.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Model Laboratory School is a public laboratory school located on the campus of Eastern Kentucky University, in Richmond, Kentucky, United States.

She competed in the shot put at the 1952, 1956, 1960 and 1964 Olympics and finished in first, second, seventh and third place, respectively; in 1952 she also finished fourth in the javelin throw. Between 1952 and 1956 she set eight consecutive world records and 14 national records in the shot put. In 1953, she became the first woman to throw over 16 meters (16.20 m). As a child Zybina was much weakened by hunger and cold during the Siege of Leningrad in World War II, which killed her mother and brother, while her father died at the front lines. Yet by 1950 she became a top Soviet thrower and won a bronze in the javelin at the European championships. During her entire career as a competitor and coach Zybina accentuated on technique rather than strength. She was left out of the Soviet team before the 1968 Olympics and retired 1969, because of her age, although she was still a second Soviet shot putter. In retirement she worked as athletics coach in Värska, Estonia. Zybina was married to Yury Fyodorov, a Russian captain and commander of the Russian cruiser Aurora in 1964–85. The cruiser was famous for starting the 1917 October Revolution, but by 1960s was a museum ship. In 1959 she gave birth to a son, which partly explains her poor performance at the 1960 Olympics.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The descending colon is the part of the large intestine from the splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon.

It is written as a lifelong series of journals kept by Mountstuart, a writer whose life (1906–1991) spanned the defining episodes of the 20th century, crossed several continents and included a convoluted sequence of relationships and literary endeavours. Boyd uses the diary form to explore how public events impinge on individual consciousness, so that Mountstuart's journal alludes almost casually to the war, the death of a prime minister or the abdication of the king. Boyd plays ironically on the theme of literary celebrity, introducing his protagonist to several real writers who are included as characters – a spat with Virginia Woolf in London, a possible sexual encounter with Evelyn Waugh at Oxford, a clumsy exchange with James Joyce in Paris, and a friendship with Ernest Hemingway that spans several years. Boyd spent 30 months writing the novel. The journal style, with its gaps, false starts and contradictions, reinforces the theme of the changing self in the novel. Many plot points simply fade away. The novel received mixed reviews from critics on publication, but has sold well. A television adaptation was made with the screenplay written by Boyd, first broadcast in 2010.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":":Geco redirects here; Geco may also refer to a former company Geophysical Company of Norway , or gEco, is a leading cross-border market-entry consultancy for the licensing and commercialization of environmentally responsible technologies. gEco collaborates with overseas universities in the early-stage investment and development of innovations in the green technology, nanotechnology and biotechnology sectors.

Thoracic spinal stenosis, at the level of the mid-back, is much less common. Cervical spinal stenosis can be far more dangerous by compressing the spinal cord. Cervical canal stenosis may lead to serious symptoms such as major body weakness and paralysis. Such severe spinal stenosis symptoms are virtually absent in lumbar stenosis, however, as the spinal cord terminates at the top end of the adult lumbar spine, with only nerve roots (cauda equina) continuing further down.

Vergadeika lies less than a kilometer away from the large settlement of Longanikos, which has a current population of approximately 300 people. Due to the larger size of Longanikos, Vergadeika is considered to be \"within\" Longanikos for purposes of classification and official administration.

This village, as well its neighboring villages, had a much higher population several decades ago, but migration to the major Greek cities, such as Athens, and abroad, namely to the United States, diminished the population tremendously. Presently, there are mostly elderly Greeks who reside in the village, while their children return from the large metropolitan areas for weekend vacations or major holidays.

Wilbur Cahoon arrived in Avon in 1814 from Herkimer County, New York with his wife, Priscilla and family; he was Avon's first settler and an early industrialist. Cahoon purchased 800 acres through a trade of 100 acres in New York. His new land was covered by a forest, and he and his family constructed a log cabin as a temporary shelter. In the following year, he began to build a sawmill nearby along French Creek, and in 1818 established a gristmill. The log cabin was no longer the Cahoon family home after 1826, when the present house was erected. Later in life, Cahoon entered into local public service: he served as Justice of the Peace for Avon, Sheffield and Dover Townships, as well as holding offices such as overseer of the poor, elections judge, and constable. Cahoon's house is a Greek Revival building with prominent local vernacular influences. Although the style is typical of period houses in the region, its floor plan is unusually disorderly, in contrast to the symmetry of typical Greek Revival structures, and the house is unusually short for its footprint. Set on a stone foundation, the house is a two-story wooden structure with a protruding gabled section on the left, as seen from the road. Shuttered windows fill much of the wall space on the facade. In 1978, the Cahoon House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its connection to Cahoon.

The purpose of Marxism–Leninism is the revolutionary development of a bourgeois state into a socialist state, realised through the leadership of a party vanguard, composed of professional revolutionaries from the working class. The socialist state is realised in the dictatorship of the proletariat, and is governed by way of democratic centralism, which Lenin described as \"diversity in discussion, unity in action\". Politically, Marxism–Leninism establishes the communist party as the primary force to organise society into a socialist state, which is one stage towards the socio-economic development of a communist state — an egalitarian society without stratified social classes, which features common ownership of the means of production, concentrated development of industry, science, and technology for the continual growth of the productive forces of the people; and public control of the social institutions, the land, and the natural resources of the country. Joseph Stalin suggested the term and applied it to narrowly define the theories and political praxis proposed by Marx and Lenin; which definition Stalin then used to establish ideologic orthodoxy among Communists. In the USSR, the term Marxism–Leninism became common, political usage after publication of The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) (1938), by Stalin, which became the official textbook on the subject. Critical of the Stalinist model of communism in the USSR, the American Marxist Raya Dunayevskaya and the Italian Marxist Amadeo Bordiga criticised Marxism–Leninism as a type of state capitalism. That Karl Marx had identified state ownership of the means of production as a form of state capitalism — except under certain socio-economic conditions, which usually do not exist in Marxist–Leninist states. That the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat is a form of democratic state; therefore, the single-party-rule of a vanguard party is undemocratic. That Marxism–Leninism is neither Marxism nor Leninism, nor a philosophic synthesis, but an artificial term that Stalin used to control ideological orthodoxy; what is Communism and what is not Communism.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Black Stallion is a 1979 American adventure film based on the 1941 classic children's novel The Black Stallion by Walter Farley.

Born Kitty Bowler in Plymouth, Massachusetts, Wintringham studied at Bryn Mawr College. There, she became involved in anti-fascist activity, joining the League Against War and Fascism and the International Labor Defense. In 1936, Bowler travelled to Europe. She first went to the Soviet Union, where she had a brief relationship with Walter Duranty, then to France, and on to Barcelona. This was during the Spanish Civil War, and she met Tom Wintringham, representative of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in the city. Wintringham taught Bowler journalism skills, while Bowler assisted him by delivering messages and acting as his unofficial secretary. The two fell in love, but Wintringham was already married, and the CPGB disapproved of Bowler as she was not a communist, and they considered her to be unreliable. Bowler claimed that, when she delivered a message from Wintringham to London, she asked that they recall Wintringham, but Harry Pollitt, leader of the CPGB, responded by saying he should \"go up to the front line, get himself killed to give us a headline\". Bowler returned to Spain and took on various journalistic assignments. However, early in 1937, she was detained on the orders of André Marty on suspicion of being a spy, and expelled from the country. Wintringham was shot in the leg the following month, and she was allowed back into Spain to help nurse him. However, the CPGB ordered Wintringham to stop associating with Bowler, and in July she was again expelled from Spain, on this occasion returning to the United States. Wintringham recovered from his injury, but was shot again in August, and was sent back to the UK to receive treatment. Once he had recovered, the couple set up home together in London, leading to Wintringham's expulsion from the CPGB. They married in 1941, once Wintringham's divorce was complete. Kitty worked as a journalist in the UK. She and Tom joined the left-wing 1941 Committee and were founders of its successor, the Common Wealth Party. However, Kitty strongly disagreed with leading member Richard Acland over his advocacy of Christianity. She stood for the party in Midlothian and Peebles Northern at the 1945 UK general election, but took only 6.4% of the votes cast. Vincent Geoghegan considers this to be the only seat where the party put up a candidate against Labour and affected the final result, although this meant that the Conservatives won the seat. After World War II, Kitty gave birth to a child, Benjamin, and focused on bringing him up. Tom died suddenly in 1949 and, a few years later, Kitty moved to Hawaii, but she later returned to the UK. She committed suicide in 1966.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Philip Gordon Wylie (May 12, 1902 – October 25, 1971) was an American author of works ranging from pulp science fiction, mysteries, social diatribes and satire, to ecology and the threat of nuclear holocaust.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Overloon is a village with 3,626 inhabitants on the outskirts of Peel, in the municipality of Boxmeer, Noord-Brabant.

His disappearance helped launch the missing children movement, which included new legislation and new methods for tracking down missing children. Several years after he disappeared, Patz was one of the first children to be profiled on the \"photo on a milk carton\" campaigns of the early 1980s. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan designated May 25—the anniversary of Etan's disappearance—as National Missing Children's Day in the United States. Decades later, it was determined that Etan had been abducted and murdered. The case was reopened in 2010 by the Manhattan District Attorney's office. In 2012, the FBI excavated the basement of the alleged crime scene near the Patz residence but discovered no new evidence. Pedro Hernandez—a suspect who confessed— was charged and indicted later that year on charges of second-degree murder and first-degree kidnapping. In 2014, the case went through a series of hearings to determine whether or not Hernandez's statements before he received his Miranda rights were legally admissible at trial.

Pouka moved to France in the 1940s. The society he found there failed to live up to his idealistic expectations, but he explained such elements away as deviations from God's plan for Cameroonians and the belief that God would punish those French people whom he found cruel or exploitative. Nevertheless, when Pouka returned to Cameroun in the 1950s, his poems were increasingly characterised by a \"vague uneasiness\".

It was officially opened on Earth Day, April 22, 2013. The Bullitt Center was designed to be the greenest commercial building in the world, and was certified as a \"Living Building\" by the International Living Future Institute in April 2015. It was built by the Bullitt Foundation, a non-profit group based in Seattle that focuses on urban ecology. The foundation is a tenant, occupying half of one floor in the six story building, with additional commercial tenants - including the University of Washington, Hammer & Hand, Sonos, Intentional Futures and PAE Consulting Engineers - occupying the rest of the building. The building is fully leased. Construction costs for the six-story, building were $18.5 million, or $355 per square foot. Including land and soft costs, the cost is $32.5 million. For this price the building provided \"tenant ready\" space (as opposed to the typical \"cold dark shell\" that most commercial spaces deliver). The Bullitt Center was designed to have a 250-year lifespan. In 2016, the Bullitt Center produced nearly 30 percent more energy than it needed for all uses, from the solar panels on its roof. As a result, it is one of the largest \"net positive\" energy buildings in the world. Energy is generated by a large solar panel array (composed of 575 panels) on the roof of the building, along with energy conservation measures that cut the building's energy consumption to approximately 15% of a typical office building of similar size. In 2016, the Bullitt Center had an energy use intensity (EUI) of 12, compared to an average commercial building in Seattle with an EUI of 90 or more. Although the building is connected to the electricity grid and at times draws more power than it produces (especially during the Seattle's cloudy winter), at other times it produces enough surplus energy to \"repay\" such withdrawals, yielding annual net positive energy. Other features of the building include an onsite rainwater-to-potable water system, which will filter collected rainwater for all purposes once it is approved by regulators. There is also an onsite composting toilet system, the world's only 6-story system of its kind. Considered to be at the current cutting edge of green construction, the structure requires a number of technical, legal, and social innovations to achieve a high level of ecological performance. The long-term, 250-year design of the building created financing challenges, as banks were unfamiliar with and thus hesitant to back such a project, because commercial buildings are typically financed based on an assumed 40-year lifespan. The 52,000 gallon rainwater collection and UV light purification system has run into challenges with public health regulations, which require that water for consumption be chlorinated. The owners are working to meet regulatory requirements, using ceramic filters and adding chlorine. The builders have negotiated with building material suppliers to ensure their products did not contain any of over 360 toxic chemicals; the supplier of the building sealant, for instance, agreed to remove phthalates from their product so that the building could use it. The structure also includes social design elements to reduce consumer energy use: the building may provide immediate feedback on energy use and publicize energy consumption via a  real-time energy dashboard. Additional features include 26 geothermal wells that extend 400 ft into the ground, where the temperature is a constant 55 °F. These wells help heat the building in the winter and cool it in summer. A heavy timber structure, all of the building's lumber is certified to standards set by the Forest Stewardship Council and it is the first commercial building in the U.S. to earn FSC Project Certification. Also, the building has no parking spaces—only bike racks.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The First Crusade march down the Mediterranean coast, from recently taken Antioch to Jerusalem, started on 13 January 1099.

Conch shell trumpets have been played in many Pacific Island countries, as well as South America and Southern Asia. They produce warm, full, and far-carrying tone.\" The shells of large marine gastropods are blown into as if it were a trumpet, as in blowing horn. A completely unmodified conch may be used, or, \"a mouth hole is created either by breaking off the point of the shell (for end-blown conches) or by boring a small hole in the body (for side-blown conches). Wooden, bamboo, or even metal mouthpieces may be inserted into the end of the shell.\" Embouchure is used to produce notes from the harmonic series. A tone hole may be added to change the fundamental frequency but globally this is extremely rare, thus most conches are natural horns. Various species of large marine gastropod shells can be turned into \"blowing shells\", but some of the best-known species are: the sacred chank or shankha Turbinella pyrum; the \"Triton's trumpet\" Charonia tritonis; and the Queen Conch Strombus gigas. \"The most common types of shell used for trumpets are the triton ('trumpet shell'), cassis ('helmet shell') and strombus ('true conch').\"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Coffin Rock is an Australian melodramatic thriller film directed by Rupert Glasson and produced by David Lightfoot.

The X Class is unique in having six active fleets around the Solent area, between Chichester Harbour in the East and Poole Harbour in the West. In each of the locations a well-established local Club manages the racing. Seasons and race programmes vary to meet the requirements of the local membership. The X One Design was designed by Alfred Westmacott, who was Managing Director of Woodnutts Boatyard at St Helens on the Isle of Wight. He specialised in building small day racing boats and these included the Seaview Mermaid, Solent Sunbeam and Victory. Racing first took place in Southampton Water in 1911 under the auspices of the MYC (later to become the Royal Motor Yacht Club). By the outbreak of the First World War some ten boats had been built. After the First World War, building resumed in 1923, continued till 1939, stopped during WW2 and resumed in 1946. The latest boat built was as recently as 2007. The hull shape has remained unchanged since the original design but there have been changes to the approved types of timber, fastenings and surface treatments. This last change was perhaps the most important, as many boats have now been epoxied with considerable savings in upkeep and prolonging the life of the boats so treated. X One Design racing takes place throughout the season in six locations around the Solent. At each one a full programme of racing is organised by the Clubs involved. Of the 202 X boats ever built, after allowing for those lost to fire, storm, neglect and one even to enemy action, there are still 190 registered. XOD fleets are in Cowes, Hamble, Itchenor, Lymington, Parkstone and Yarmouth. An X is usually crewed competitively by three people, although it is possible to sail with two. The spinnaker can be hoisted without the crew leaving the cockpit. The XOD fleet is an important part of Cowes Week one of the longest-running regular regattas in the world. XOD's were first raced in August 1911. 2011 marked the Centenary year with an unprecedented 145 entries in Cowes Week. The X Class continues to hold a special place in the event with over 80 yachts racing in the 2014 Cowes Week regatta. This regatta included a yacht originally built over a century ago in 1911 named Madcap - sail number X5. The oldest XOD - X1 Mistletoe belongs to The National Maritime Museum of Greenwich, London.

Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent upon self-identification and shared experience. The term \"BDSM\" is first recorded in a Usenet posting from 1991, and is interpreted as a combination of the abbreviations B/D (Bondage and Discipline), D/s (Dominance and submission), and S/M (Sadism and Masochism). BDSM is now used as a catch-all phrase covering a wide range of activities, forms of interpersonal relationships, and distinct subcultures. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include cross-dressers, body modification enthusiasts, animal roleplayers, rubber fetishists, and others. Activities and relationships within a BDSM context are often characterized by the participants taking on complementary, but unequal roles; thus, the idea of informed consent of both the partners is essential. The terms \"submissive\" and \"dominant\" are often used to distinguish these roles: the dominant partner (\"dom\") takes psychological control over the submissive (\"sub\"). The terms \"top\" and \"bottom\" are also used: the top is the instigator of an action while the bottom is the receiver of the action. The two sets of terms are subtly different: for example, someone may choose to act as bottom to another person, for example, by being whipped, purely recreationally, without any implication of being psychologically dominated by them, or a submissive may be ordered to massage their dominant partner. Despite the bottom performing the action and the top receiving they have not necessarily switched roles. The abbreviations \"sub\" and \"dom\" are frequently used instead of \"submissive\" and \"dominant\". Sometimes the female-specific terms \"mistress\", \"domme\" or \"dominatrix\" are used to describe a dominant woman, instead of the gender-neutral term \"dom\". Individuals who can change between top/dominant and bottom/submissive roles—whether from relationship to relationship or within a given relationship—are known as switches. The precise definition of roles and self-identification is a common subject of debate within the community.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Theta (, ; uppercase Θ or ϴ, lowercase θ (which resembles digit 0 with horizontal line) or ϑ; thē̂ta ; Modern:  thī́ta ) is the eighth letter of the Greek alphabet, derived from the Phoenician letter Teth .

Due to the nature of this method, the official number of Muslims include people with no religion; converted Christians/Judaists; people who are of a different religion than Islam, Christianity or Judaism; and anyone who is of a different religion than their parents, but has not applied for a change of their individual records. The state currently does not allow the individual records to be changed to anything other than Islam, Christianity or Judaism, and the latter two are only accepted with a document of recognition released by an officially recognised church or synagogue. According to a study done in Turkey it is said that 95% Believe in God while 75% are religious. Among Shia Muslim presence in Turkey there is a small but considerable minority of Muslims with Ismaili heritage and affiliation. Christians (Oriental Orthodoxy, Greek Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic) and Jews (Sephardi), who comprise the non-Muslim religious population, make up less than 1% of the total. Turkey is officially a secular country with no official religion since the constitutional amendment in 1924 and later strengthened by Atatürk's Reforms and the appliance of laïcité by the country's founder and first president Mustafa Kemal Atatürk at the end of 1937. However, currently all public schools from elementary to high school hold mandatory religion classes which mostly focus on the Sunni sect of Islam. In these classes, children are required to learn prayers and other religious practices which belong specifically to Sunnism. Thus, although Turkey is officially a secular state, the teaching of religious practices in public grade schools has been controversial. Its application to join the European Union divided existing members, some of which questioned whether a Muslim country could fit in. Turkish politicians have accused the country's EU opponents of favouring a \"Christian club\". Beginning in the 1980s, the role of religion in the state has been a divisive issue, as influential religious factions challenged the complete secularization called for by Kemalism and the observance of Islamic practices experienced a substantial revival. In the early 2000s (decade), Islamic groups challenged the concept of a secular state with increasing vigor after Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP) came into power in 2002. In a poll conducted by Sabancı University, 98.3% of Turks revealed they were Muslim.

He appears only in the account of the Byzantine court historians Kedrenos and John Skylitzes, who place him at Kerch and calls him \"khagan\" (the title of the Khazar emperors). Kedrenos states that he was captured by the expeditionary force but does not relate his ultimate fate. Inscriptions and other references exist referring to a Tzul or Tsal clan in Crimea during this period; presumably he was a member although the relationship of that family to the original ruling dynasty of Khazaria is unknown. Almost nothing else about him, including the extent of his holdings, is known. Despite the fact that earlier writers maintained that the Khazar khagan was required to adhere to Judaism, Georgius is a Christian name. Whether Georgius Tzul was himself a Christian, a Jew or Shamanist with an unusual Greek name, or whether the name is merely a Byzantine attempt to transliterate a Turkic or Hebrew name, is unknown. It is worth noting that Byzantine campaigns occurred roughly during this period against the Georgians and the Bulgarian Empire, suggesting a concerted effort to re-establish Byzantine dominance in the Black Sea region.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Vertu was a British-based manufacturer and retailer of luxury handmade mobile phones, established by Finnish mobile-phone manufacturer Nokia in 1998.

It took its name from the defunct Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway, which was nicknamed the \"Big Four Railroad\". It is now a converted pedestrian and bicycle bridge from Louisville into Jeffersonville, Indiana. Access to the Big Four Bridge is limited to pedestrian and bicycle use. A pedestrian ramp on the Kentucky side was opened on February 7, 2013. The original approaches that carried rail traffic onto the main spans were first removed in 1969, earning the Big Four Bridge the nickname \"Bridge That Goes Nowhere\". The George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge downstream, which carries U.S. 31 across the river, was previously the only bridge allowing bicyclists and pedestrians to travel between Louisville and the neighboring Indiana cities of New Albany, Clarksville, and Jeffersonville. In February 2011, Kentucky and Indiana announced that the two states, along with the City of Jeffersonville, would allocate $22 million in funding to complete the Big Four Bridge project, creating a pedestrian and bicycle path to link Louisville and Jeffersonville. Indiana would spend up to $8 million and the City of Jeffersonville would provide $2 million in matching dollars to pay for construction of a ramp to the Big Four Bridge. Kentucky pledged $12 million to replace the deck on the bridge and connect it to the spiral ramp that was completed in Waterfront Park. On February 7, 2013, the Louisville ramp was opened for pedestrian and bicycle traffic. Initially planned for August 2013, the Jeffersonville ramp opened on May 20, 2014.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Shahdagh Qusar FK (Azerbaijani: Şahdağ Qusar FK) is an Azerbaijani football club based in Qusar, that currently takes part in Azerbaijan First Division.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The periventricular nucleus is a thin sheet of small neurons located in the wall of the third ventricle, a composite structure of the hypothalamus.
