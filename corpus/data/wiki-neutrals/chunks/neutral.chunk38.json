A very basic machine, it was designed by Cuthbert Clarke and resembled a three-wheeled sidecar in most respects. The car was powered by a 3.75 hp single-cylinder, two stroke, 270 cc Villiers engine and had a friction drive two-speed transmission, using two cork covered wheels of different sizes, chain driven by the engine. These wheels ran within a drum which was mounted on the single rear wheel and one would make contact to provide drive at the appropriate ratio. They were controlled by a lever which could be pushed or pulled to engage drive and had a central neutral position. There was no reverse gear. Rear suspension was by a coil spring on the engine frame. There was no front axle, the wheels were controlled by two transverse leaf springs. Steering was by rack and pinion. Braking was on the rear wheel only and used shoes operating on the outside of the transmission drum. The first Xtra was a single seater (monocar) with a light plywood on ash frame body with an occasional seat behind the driver on top of the engine. It featured acetylene lighting. A top speed of above 30 mph (48 km/h) was claimed. The monocar was joined in November 1922 by a \"Sociable\" two seater with side by side seats and an option of having an 8 hp, V-twin JAP engine in place of the Villiers.

The enzyme catalyses the second step in the two step conversion of nitrate to ammonia, which allows certain bacteria to use nitrite as a terminal electron acceptor, rather than oxygen, during anaerobic conditions. During this process, ccNiR draws electrons from the quinol pool, which are ultimately provided by a dehydrogenase such as formate dehydrogenase or hydrogenase. These dehydrogenases are responsible for generating a proton motive force. Cytochrome c Nitrite Reductase is a homodimer which contains five c-type heme cofactors per monomer. Four of the heme centers are bis-histidine ligated and presumably serve to shuttle electrons to the active site. The active site heme, however, is uniquely ligated by a single lysine residue. This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors with a cytochrome as acceptor.

It is signed and dated 1565. Jesus and the woman taken in adultery is a biblical episode from where Jesus encounters an adulteress brought before Pharisees and scribes, which has been depicted by many artists. Such a crime was punishable by death by stoning, however, in the scene, Jesus stoops to write (in Dutch) \"he that is without sin among you, let him first cast the stone at her\" on the ground before her feet. A number of the unthrown stones lay on the floor to the left of the woman. Bruegel depicts the woman as one of the few graceful figures in the scene. She is rendered as an idealised form, atypical of Brugel's usual earthy and homely female figures; though the basic layout of the composition is Netherlandish, \"the austere composition and monumental figures are perhaps the most Italianate in all Bruegel's paintings\". Apart from an even smaller Three Soldiers in the Frick Collection, Bruegel's only other surviving grisaille painting is the Death of the Virgin at Upton House, Warwickshire, which is also an unusually conventional treatment of a religious subject by Bruegel's standards. However, the earliest documented work by Bruegel was grisaille wings for an altarpiece in 1550/51, as he finished his apprenticeship. This was in Mechelen, where he is documented between September 1550 and October 1551 assisting Peeter Baltens on an altarpiece (now lost), painting the wings. The painting was not sold by the artist, and seems to be the only one inherited by his son Jan Brueghel the Elder. An engraving was published in 1579 by Paul Perret, who was apparently lent the painting for the purpose, since there are regular pricks along the edges to enable a grid to be made. There are a number of other copies, some attributed to the artist's sons, perhaps made after the engraving, and the painting was lent to Cardinal Federico Borromeo for copying (perhaps the version now in Bergamo). A version attributed to Breuegel's son Pieter Brueghel the Younger of c. 1600 is in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The work was sold by the family in the 17th century, apparently by Jan Brueghel the Younger, and was in England by the 18th century, being sold at Christie's in 1834 and again in 1952 when it was bought by Count Antoine Seilern, whose collection was bequeathed to the Courtauld in 1978. The work was stolen from the Courtauld Gallery on 2 February 1982. Because of its value and fame, it proved unsaleable on the open market, and did not resurface again until 1992 when it was recovered by British police. During that interim, it likely acted as collateral for the criminals.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Robert P.

Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes. Once formed, proteins only exist for a certain period and are then degraded and recycled by the cell's machinery through the process of protein turnover. A protein's lifespan is measured in terms of its half-life and covers a wide range. They can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1–2 days in mammalian cells. Abnormal or misfolded proteins are degraded more rapidly either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable. Like other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins are essential parts of organisms and participate in virtually every process within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. In animals, proteins are needed in the diet to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized. Digestion breaks the proteins down for use in the metabolism. Proteins may be purified from other cellular components using a variety of techniques such as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis, and chromatography; the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification. Methods commonly used to study protein structure and function include immunohistochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"is a town located in Niwa District, Aichi Prefecture, Japan.

The ramp sits at an acute angle to deflect the intake air from the longitudinal direction. At supersonic flight speeds, the deflection of the air stream creates a number of oblique shock waves at each change of gradient along at the ramp. Air crossing each shock wave suddenly slows to a lower Mach number, thus increasing pressure. Ideally, the first oblique shock wave should intercept the air intake lip, thus avoiding air spillage and pre-entry drag on the outer boundary of the deflected streamtube. For a fixed geometry intake at zero incidence, this condition can only be achieved at one particular flight Mach number, because the angle of the shock wave (to the longitudinal direction) becomes more acute with increasing aircraft speed. More advanced supersonic intakes feature a ramp with a number of discrete changes of gradient in order to generate multiple oblique shock waves. In the case of Concorde, the first (converging) intake ramp is followed by a diverging ramp. After the air passes the end of the first ramp it has become subsonic such that the diverging ramp further contributes towards the reduction in airstream velocity and consequently its increase in pressure. This intake design thus ensures excellent pressure recovery and contributes to Concorde's improved fuel efficiency whilst cruising supersonically at up to Mach 2.2 (beyond which airframe heating effects limit any further increase in speed). For a fixed geometry it is feasible to use curved intakes without any shocks before the final normal shock. Modern fighter jets (like the F-22 Raptor) have engines so powerful that top speed is not limited by them, thus spillage at the intake is acceptable and a lightweight fixed geometry chosen. The nacelle has a round outer lip to deflect spillage back into the longitudinal direction. The nacelle thus gets a very large cross section with more volume than needed for the engine and in the F-22 the nacelles are combined with the fuselage to create a large weapon bay, place for fuel, and a wide body, which generates some lift. Modern jets have a horizontal ramp thus spillage at least produces some lift. In the case of the F-22 the inlet has two ramps placed in a diamond shape, thus for most Mach- and thrust-conditions spillage occurs only at the aft / lower corner of that diamond. In the case of the F-22 the leading edges of the wing become supersonic at Mach 1.8 and certainly are as large a source of wave drag as the inlet. Variable geometry intakes, such as those on Concorde, vary the ramp angle to focus the series of oblique shock waves onto the intake lip, control of which is accomplished by complex non-linear control laws using the ramp void pressure (the pressure of the air in the gap between the two ramps) as a control input.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the priesthood is the power and authority to act in the name of God for the salvation of humankind.

From the 1950s until 1998 the repair shops operated under the name ZNTK Bydgoszcz, Zakłady Naprawcze Taboru Kolejowego, Repair Shop for Railway Rolling Stock’in Bydgoszcz. For most of its history the Bydgoszcz shop overhauled and repaired steam locomotives and freight cars. After the collapse in 1989 of the Communist regime in Poland the ZNTK Bydgoszcz repair shop was spun off in 1991 as an independent company. This led to a re-thinking of the firm’s activities, and in 2001 the company was renamed Pojazdy Szynowe Pesa Spółka Akcyjna Holding (its present name) and its activities were re-oriented away from repair, to the construction of new railway rolling stock. This transformation of Pesa’s activities has been very successful. Since 2001 Pesa has secured contracts to supply new Light rail vehicles (LRV’s, trams) to Warsaw, Gdańsk and other cities in Poland, Hungary, Germany and Kazakhstan; and both electric and diesel multiple unit trains (EMUs and DMUs) to operators in Poland, Italy, Kazakhstan and Germany.

This definition of the fulcrum is only correct if the sticks/mallets pivot only about that exact point - usually they do not. To more accurately describe the mechanics of drumming one must define multiple fulcrums within a 'system of levers'.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Martin John Millett, (born 30 September 1955) is a British archaeologist and academic.

Attendance has grown steadily, with the 2008 event hosting nearly twenty thousand visitors. This rise in visitors led to the rebranding of the event in 2009, which included the show being extended in length from one day to two, held on the weekend of 20 June. The event is one of three annual air shows that take place at Cotswold Airport, on which construction began in 1936, along with the Great Vintage Flying Weekend in May and the Battle of Britain Airshow in September. The two other events are held towards the northern edge of the airport, whilst the Cotswold Air Show is held towards the southern edge of the site, allowing for a much larger showground. The Red Arrows, the aerobatics display team of the Royal Air Force, were initially based at the aerodrome, and the airport is known as the team's \"spiritual home\". Because of this heritage, the event is one of the few airshows in the United Kingdom that receives special support from the Royal Air Force, as a 'Priority 1' event. Unlike many other air shows, where the flying displays continue uninterrupted, the flying displays at the Cotswold Air Show are stopped in the middle of the day for a lunch break. The event has become well known among aviation enthusiasts for flypasts of aircraft in unusual formations, which have become known as \"Kemble Moments\". In 2009, aircraft belonging to the US Air Force appeared for the first time at the event. The year also saw the debut of the restored Vulcan bomber, a project that cost over £6m over 15 years. In 2010, the event commemorated the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, featuring aircraft including the Supermarine Spitfire and the Hawker Hurricane.

This novel is a sequel to her debut novel A Golden Age. It is a story about faith and family shadowed by a war. The family that has taken active part in the war of independence has now to face the challenges of peace, within and outside. Maya returns home after almost a decade of absence and finds her beloved brother Sohail completely transformed. She still has the same revolutionary zeal, but Sohail has resorted to religiosity in its puritanical form. The ideological difference between him and his sister creates a deep seated schism in their minds. This difference is the central conflict in The Good Muslim. They have charted their own ways, opposite to each other’s, of moving forward in the shadow of the tortuous history. Maya is a liberal-minded ‘village doctor’ who helps women victims of war. She performs abortions so that the women who had conceived as a result of rape do not have to carry the stigma. Thus she witnesses misery all the time, everywhere. Sohail’s way of being a good Muslim is altogether different from his sister’s. He has embraced an extreme version of Islam as defined by the Tablighi Jamaat, which shuns the joyful life filled with music, friends and liberal values. Sohail wants to send his son to a madrasa and, as a result, a conflict ensues between them and comes to a devastating climax.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Statistics of L.

In contrast to regular emulators only the instructions are translated, not the entire system, thus making it fast and flexible. The Lx86 software senses that it is executing x86 code and translates it to PowerPC code at execution, and these instructions are later cached ensuring that the translation process only has to take place once, further reducing the drop in performance usually associated with emulation. Lx86 does not support applications that access hardware directly, like kernel modules. Earlier versions of Lx86 did not run code that makes use of SSE instructions, though as of version 1.3.2 the SSE and SSE2 instruction sets were supported. The product was at first marketed as System p AVE (System p Application Virtual Environment) and was incorrectly reported as PAVE (Portable Advanced Virtualization Emulator) in the press but the name has since changed to PowerVM Lx86. Lx86 was based on the QuickTransit dynamic translator from Transitive, the same that Apple uses for its Rosetta emulation layer that enables Mac OS X to run unmodified PowerPC binaries on their Intel-based Macintoshes.

Market socialism differs from non-market socialism in that the market mechanism is utilized for the allocation of capital goods and the means of production. Depending on the specific model of market socialism, profits generated by socially owned firms (i.e. net revenue not reinvested into expanding the firm) may variously be used to directly remunerate employees, accrue to society at large as the source of public finance or be distributed amongst the population in a social dividend. Market socialism is distinguished from the concept of the mixed economy because unlike the mixed economy, models of market socialism are complete and self-regulating systems. Market socialism also contrasts with social democratic policies implemented within capitalist market economies: while social democracy aims to achieve greater economic stability and equality through policy measures such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programs, market socialism aims to achieve similar goals through changing patterns of enterprise ownership and management. Although economic proposals involving social ownership with factor markets have existed since the early 19th century, the term \"market socialism\" only emerged in the 1920s during the socialist calculation debate. Contemporary market socialism emerged from the debate on socialist calculation during the early-to-mid 20th century among socialist economists who believed that a socialist economy could neither function on the basis of calculation in natural units nor through solving a system of simultaneous equations for economic coordination, and that capital markets would be required in a socialist economy. Early models of market socialism trace their roots to the work of Adam Smith and the theories of classical economics, which consisted of proposals for cooperative enterprises operating in a free-market economy. The aim of such proposals was to eliminate exploitation by allowing individuals to receive the full product of their labor while removing the market-distorting effects of concentrating ownership and wealth in the hands of a small class of private owners. Among early advocates of market socialism were the Ricardian socialist economists and mutualist philosophers. In the early 20th century, Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner outlined a neoclassical model of socialism which included a role for a central planning board (CPB) in setting prices equal marginal cost to achieve Pareto efficiency. Even though these early models did not rely on genuine markets, they were labeled \"market socialist\" for their utilization of financial prices and calculation. In more recent models proposed by American neoclassical economists, public ownership of the means of production is achieved through public ownership of equity and social control of investment.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Pallis () is a Greek surname and may refer to:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Kang Tae-oh (born Kim Yoon-hwan on June 20, 1994) is a South Korean actor and singer.

He joined the PGA Tour in 1937 and went on to win 36 events on the Tour. He might have won more if his career had not been interrupted by service in World War II. While serving in the U.S. Army and training for the D-Day landings, Mangrum was offered the professional's job at the Fort Meade golf course in Maryland, which would have kept him out of combat, but he declined. He was awarded two Purple Hearts after being wounded at Normandy and Battle of the Bulge. He was also awarded two Silver and two Bronze Stars while serving in General Patton's Third Army. His best years on tour came after the war: he led the PGA Tour money list in 1951 and won the Vardon Trophy for the lowest scoring average on the tour in both 1951 and 1953.

He lost a playoff for the 1950 U.S. Open at Merion to Ben Hogan and his famous one-iron. Mangrum finished in the top ten at the Masters Tournament ten consecutive years.

Moscovici (also known as Tovilie; November 28, 1885 – November 1, 1943) was a Romanian socialist militant and journalist, one of the noted leaders of the Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSDR). A socialist since early youth and a party member since its creation in 1910, he returned from captivity in World War I to lead the PSDR from Bucharest, and involved himself in a violent clash with the Romanian authorities. He mediated between reformist and Bolshevik currents, and helped establish the Socialist Party of Romania (PS) as a fusion of both tendencies. Moscovici served as a PS representative in Chamber, but was deposed over his instigation of the 1920 general strike, then imprisoned. Although he voted against the creation of a Communist Party from the rump PS and criticized Comintern interference in Romanian affairs, he was again apprehended in 1921. Together with the communists, he appeared as a defendant in the Dealul Spirii Trial. Moscovici spent the 1920s and '30s on reconstructing the PSDR and enlarging its basis, sometimes together with, and sometimes against, the moderate socialist Constantin Titel Petrescu. He was the party's representative to the Labor and Socialist International, a participant in antifascist causes, and a publisher of Marxist literature. Seen as the Social Democratic doctrinaire, he continued to take stands against the Communist Party and the Soviet Union, cautioning against the formation of a \"popular front\". Persecuted by the far-right for his politics and his Jewish ethnicity, Moscovici was still active in the clandestine PSDR by the time of World War II. He died, after a long illness, before his party's involvement in the Coup of 1944. In later years, after the PSDR was absorbed by the Communist Party, Moscovici's contribution was censored out of socialist history. His work was carried on by his daughter, Mira Moscovici, who helped reestablish an independent PSDR in 1990, during the country's post-communist era. Moscovici's relatives include French social scientist Serge Moscovici and his son, the politician Pierre Moscovici.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Es Figueral is a small resort village and beach on the northeastern coast of Ibiza, near the Illa de Tagomago.

She later became one of the main characters in its spinoff series, The Jeffersons. Her role lasted from 1971 to 1985, from her debut on All in the Family through the final episode of The Jeffersons. She was often referred to as \"Weezie\" by her on-screen husband, George Jefferson, and sometimes as \"Mrs. J.\" by her neighbor Archie Bunker. She was first introduced on All in the Family as a neighbor of Archie and Edith Bunker. Sanford appeared in 252 out of the 253 episodes of The Jeffersons. Louise was similar in many respects to the character Edith Bunker in All in the Family. Both were kind-hearted and had hot-headed husbands, and they were both good friends; however, Louise was not nearly as naïve as Edith. Prior to George Jefferson's first appearance on All in the Family, Louise had to contend with the arguments between Henry Jefferson, George's brother, and Archie Bunker. While Louise recognized that Archie displayed some ignorance and bullheadedness, she saw similar traits in the Jefferson men. When Edith apologized for a poor attitude of Archie's, Louise remarked \"Henry is no diplomat either\". Unlike George and Henry, Louise was more favorably disposed to Archie Bunker, having visiting him when he had been hospitalized, and fondly remembering Archie during an episode of The Jeffersons when there was a flashback to All in the Family. Likewise, Archie bore no real animus towards Louise. In the first few seasons of The Jeffersons, Louise dealt with insulting remarks from Mother Jefferson, George's mother. She was a calming influence in the household compared to George's temper tantrums and over-inflated ego. She was friends with Tom and Helen Willis, an interracial couple. In the first episode of The Jeffersons, George insisted on hiring a maid. Both George and Louise grew up in poverty, and Louise felt it was not necessary to hire a maid. George won out and Florence Johnston (Marla Gibbs) was hired a few days a week. Over time, the role of Florence expanded and she became a live-in maid. Louise and Florence became great friends over the years while Florence and George often argued. Louise grew up in Harlem, New York. She had only a limited memory of her father and was always of the belief that he had died when she was very young. In a memorable episode, however, George meets a man at a newsstand whom he suspects of being Louise's father. At first, the man denies his identity, saying that George is mistaken. But later, he acknowledges that he is Louise's father and decides to show up to see her. In the meantime, though, George has discovered that for Louise, finding out that her father is actually alive would not be good news. His being alive and well would mean that her father had willingly chosen to abandon her as a child, and that is a thought which she cannot bear. When her father does come to the Jeffersons' apartment, he is able to receive the satisfaction of seeing how his daughter turned out, but at George's insistence, he spares her feelings when he is introduced to her, by reverting to his original story: that George was mistaken in believing that he was Louise's father. However, in other episodes, Louise's father is portrayed as having been more involved with her. In \"Louise's New Interest\", she talks about her father giving her a Native American doll when he couldn't find a black one for her. Louise also had a sister, Maxine, with whom she was a constant rival when they were growing up. Louise believed that her mother favored Maxine, but it wasn't until Louise's wedding day that her mother told Louise that she was the better of the two. In her teen years, Maxine had run away from home, leaving Louise to care for their mother, causing more resentment of Maxine from Louise. In one episode of the show, George arranges for Maxine to return to New York from Paris as a surprise birthday present for Louise, only to learn that Louise hated her. During this episode, it was revealed that Maxine left home because she was pregnant, and, as a result, she introduced her son to the family. When Louise learned of this, she forgave her sister and they mended their feud. One episode of All in the Family mention is made of George Jefferson's brother-in-law who, like Archie Bunker, had fallen for a scam. Louise also had a niece named Julie Williams (Lynne Moody), a nurse who lived in Chicago (on the short-lived series E/R). In a season-five episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Isabel Sanford and Sherman Hemsley reprise their roles as Louise and George, respectively. In one scene, Louise attacks George for calling her \"Weezie\" because she's sensitive about her asthma. They later appeared in the series finale episode, debating whether to buy the house owned by the Banks family.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Santiago de Murcia (25 July 1673 – 25 April 1739) was a Spanish guitarist and composer.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"\"Please Forgive Me\" is a song by Canadian rock musician Bryan Adams.

Most taxonomic authorities lump this species and the eastern cattle egret together (called the cattle egret), but some (including the International Ornithologists' Union separate them. Despite the similarities in plumage to the egrets of the genus Egretta, it is more closely related to the herons of Ardea. Originally native to parts of Asia, Africa and Europe, it has undergone a rapid expansion in its distribution and successfully colonised much of the rest of the world in the last century. It is a white bird adorned with buff plumes in the breeding season. It nests in colonies, usually near bodies of water and often with other wading birds. The nest is a platform of sticks in trees or shrubs. Western cattle egrets exploit drier and open habitats more than other heron species. Their feeding habitats include seasonally inundated grasslands, pastures, farmlands, wetlands and rice paddies. They often accompany cattle or other large mammals, catching insect and small vertebrate prey disturbed by these animals. Some populations of the cattle egret are migratory and others show post-breeding dispersal. The adult cattle egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks may be lost to starvation, calcium deficiency or disturbance from other large birds. This species maintains a special relationship with cattle, which extends to other large grazing mammals; wider human farming is believed to be a major cause of their suddenly expanded range. The cattle egret removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Héctor Elías Barraza Chávez (born 11 June 1961) is a Mexican politician from the Party of the Democratic Revolution.

It is the second-most widely spoken language and a member of the so-named Visayan language family and is more distantly related to other Philippine languages. Hiligaynon is mainly concentrated in the regions of Western Visayas (Iloilo, Capiz, Guimaras, and Negros Occidental), as well as in South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, and North Cotabato in SOCCSKSARGEN.

It is also spoken as a second language by Kinaray-a speakers in Antique, Aklanon/Malaynon speakers in Aklan, Capiznon speakers in Capiz and Cebuano speakers in Negros Oriental. There are approximately 9,300,000 people in and out of the Philippines who are native speakers of Hiligaynon and an additional 5,000,000 capable of speaking it with a substantial degree of proficiency.

Unlike the rest of Balham, it is wholly within the London Borough of Lambeth. Its boundaries are: to the south Emmanuel Road; to the east: Radbourne Road; to the north: Hydethorpe Road; and to the west: Cavendish Road. Historically, the estate was one large medieval field of some sixty acres located at the southern edge of the parish of Clapham. The area was known as the Hyde during the Middle Ages, and later as Hydefield. In 1587 the field was purchased by Richard Martyn who then sold it to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, which had been founded three years earlier. The names of Emmanuel Road and Scholars Road commemorate this history. The Hyde farm was reputedly particularly well known for its pigs. The Hyde Farm Estate was developed between 1896 and 1916. Prior to development starting, the historic field boundary with Tooting Common was realigned. The narrow strip of the common to the east of Cavendish Road was enclosed and the line of Emmanuel Road (formerly Bleak Hall Lane) was moved north to provide a compensating wider portion of common land to the north of the railway line between Streatham Hill and Balham (now known as Emmanuel Field). The E Hayes-Dashwood Foundation was established in 1946 to provide low-cost housing to infirm or disabled ex-servicemen and their widows. It now owns approximately one hundred and fifty of the properties in the area, most of the remainder having been sold to leaseholders or to other housing associations.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Youri Mulder (; born 23 March 1969 in Brussels, Belgium) is a retired Dutch footballer who played as a striker and also a manager.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Scheller College of Business at the Georgia Institute of Technology was established in 1912, and is consistently ranked in the top 35 business programs in the nation.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Psalmopoeus is a genus of the family Theraphosidae containing various species of   tarantulas.

It has always had a relatively young membership with an active social scene. The building's partially 1930s Art Deco architecture, in addition to the main Adam interiors, is quite distinctive. In 1930 Westminster City Council decided to improve access to Berkeley Square through creating an extra road into the square. This was accomplished by demolishing half of Lansdowne House, which had stood there since the 18th century. The remaining half was given a new frontage, and a newly renovated interior, and was founded as the Lansdowne Club. The 'First Drawing Room' was reinstated in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Dining Room in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. From the outset, it was founded as a 'social, residential and athletic Club for members of social standing' and their families, and unlike many London clubs it had no vocational, artistic, or political 'theme'. The Club's facilities include a ballroom, a terrace, a fencing salle and a basement gym including an Art Deco swimming pool. The club's internal architecture is extremely unusual and relatively modern for a London club, being significantly Art Deco, as opposed to the more usual Georgian/Victorian/Edwardian styles found in other clubs. The splendid Adam Room and other parts of the Club on the ground floor are Georgian though. The building underwent extensive renovation and further modernisation in 2000.

Originally known as the New York Handicap, its name was changed to the Display Handicap in 1955 (the name \"New York Handicap\" was later appended to another stakes race for fillies and mares three years old and up, and is now run on the grass, or turf course). The distance of the Display Handicap varied at different times, but was always at least, and was run at from the late 1960s until its last running in 1990. The race was aptly named for Display, a son of Fair Play (as was Man o' War, elected #1 in the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century). Display was noted for being able to carry heavy weights over marathon distances successfully. The Display Handicap was distinctive for the fact that many horses who normally ran in claiming races (but possessed abundant stamina) would be entered in it, and a few such horses went on to win the event. In 1978, Seaney Bear nosed out Framarco, another horse who ran mostly in claiming races. They competed in one of the two divisions of the race which were run in that year, necessitated by an unusually high number of horses entered in the race. Although the race was for 3-year-olds and up, it was rare for a 3-year-old to win it; when In the Ruff won the 1983 running, he became the first 3-year-old winner of the Display since Dean Carl in 1963, and the first ever at the 2¼-mile distance. Horses bred (and sometimes based) outside the United States often competed in the Display; one such horse &mdash; the Argentine-bred Paraje &mdash; won it three years in a row in the early 1970s. Horses were also frequently shipped from Canada to compete. In the race's later years field sizes became progressively smaller, with only five starters in what would prove to be the final running in 1990. The discontinuing of the Display Handicap left the Valedictory Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario (run at 1¾ miles) as the longest stakes race run on the dirt in North America.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Coenraadt \"Coen\" Moulijn OON (15 February 1937 – 4 January 2011) was a Dutch footballer who played for Feyenoord from 1955 to 1972 and was part of their European Cup victory in 1970.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Footreading, also known as \"solestry\" (coined from sole, on the analogy of palmistry), is a method of divination by means of the foot.

In 2003, nineteen different songs topped the chart, then published under the title Hot Country Singles & Tracks, in 52 issues of the magazine, based on weekly airplay data from country music radio stations compiled by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems. Singer George Strait's song \"She'll Leave You with a Smile\" was at number one at the start of the year, having been at the top since the issue dated December 28, 2002. It remained at number one for one further week in 2003 before being replaced by \"19 Somethin'\" by Mark Wills. The highest total number of weeks spent at number one by a song in 2003 was the eight achieved by \"It's Five O'Clock Somewhere\", a collaboration between Alan Jackson and Jimmy Buffett. The duet spent an initial seven weeks at the top, was replaced for a week, and then returned for a final week at number one. The song's first spell at number one tied for the longest unbroken run at the top with \"Have You Forgotten?\" by Darryl Worley. The success of \"It's Five O'Clock Somewhere\" gave Jimmy Buffett his first ever country number one, more than thirty years after he began his singing career. Another collaboration between a younger star and a music veteran to top the charts in 2003 was \"Beer for My Horses\" by Toby Keith and Willie Nelson, which spent six weeks at number one and made Nelson, at age 70, the oldest singer to top the chart. The number one position was dominated by male artists; no solo female singers topped the chart in 2003, although the all-female band Dixie Chicks spent a single week at number one. Three singers achieved their first number one hits in 2003, Gary Allan with \"Man to Man\", Joe Nichols with \"Brokenheartsville\", and Dierks Bentley with \"What Was I Thinkin'\". \"Brokenheartsville\"'s rise to the top benefited from a backlash against previous chart-toppers Dixie Chicks, after the group's lead singer Natalie Maines made controversial comments about then-United States President George W. Bush. This led to a number of radio stations dropping their song \"Travelin' Soldier\" and thus impacting its chart performance. Allan followed up \"Man to Man\" with a second number one later in the year with \"Tough Little Boys\" and was one of only two artists to place multiple songs at the top of the chart in 2003, the other being Toby Keith, whose six weeks at number one with \"Beer for My Horses\" and five with \"I Love This Bar\" gave him a total of eleven weeks at number one, the most by any act in 2003. The final number one of the year was \"There Goes My Life\" by Kenny Chesney.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Joseph S.

Six cities awarded teams were: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Amarillo, Texas; Billings, Montana; Butte, Montana; El Paso, Texas; and Reno, Nevada. The purpose of SWHL was to provide a professional development circuit for young American and Canadian players interested in attending college and playing hockey. It was modeled after a similar system employed by the Canadian National Hockey Team. Teams were responsible for each player’s room and board, tuition for a local college or university, and a monthly 60 dollar stipend.

This rural club has a fine history of \"punching above its weight\" producing no less than two Olympic Swimmers in Amy Smith and Claire Cashmore (Paralympian). The club also has a history of supporting disability swimming most notably in recent years through Steve Boyce (Downs Syndrome European Silver Medalist 100m Freestyle) and  Fran O'Connor (S7). WFSC pride themselves in not only providing a channel for teaching swimming and coaching competitive swimming but also in providing a warm \"family environment\" where parents, swimmers and coaches mix freely whilst maintaining a professional approach to coaching and training. The Club is Swim 21 accredited and is run on a day-to-day basis by part-time volunteers who serve on the club committee who meet once a month. WFSC is currently in a transition phase with regarding swimming pools and swimmers. A new pool is planned for the area and WFSC have had direct influence on the facilities to be available.

Nevertheless, a significant group of local swimmers brought through the club ranks by the long serving volunteer coaches remained and have formed the core of a new generation of swimmers in the area. The 2012 Olympics have also boosted the Club's Learn To Swim scheme and as a result the Club is experiencing its largest growth period for many years with over 350 swimmers on its books. The appointment of Mark Wilmott has created a subtly different environment at the club from that of his predecessor, and one which has returned the club to its grass roots and family ideals. The focus is now very much on Long Term Swimmer Development to enable people to swim at all stages in their life to whatever level they desire, be it fitness swimming or Nationals or Olympics, whilst encouraging participation in activities outside of swimming such as \"Wyre In The Wilderness\", an adventure training/team building weekend for 11- to 17-year-olds.

Snow Leopard was publicly unveiled on June 8, 2009 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. On August 28, 2009, it was released worldwide, and was made available for purchase from Apple's website and its retail stores at the price of US$29 for a single-user license. As a result of the low price, initial sales of Snow Leopard were significantly higher than that of its predecessors. The release of Snow Leopard came nearly two years after the introduction of Mac OS X Leopard, the second longest time span between successive Mac OS X releases (the time span between Tiger and Leopard was the longest). Unlike those of previous versions of Mac OS X, the goals of Snow Leopard were improved performance, greater efficiency and the reduction of its overall memory footprint. Addition of new end-user features was not a primary consideration: its name signified its goal to be a refinement of the previous OS X version, Leopard. Much of the software in Mac OS X was extensively rewritten for this release in order to take advantage fully of modern Macintosh hardware. New programming frameworks, such as OpenCL, were created, allowing software developers to use graphics cards in their applications. This is also the first Mac OS release since System 7.1.1 that does not support Macs using PowerPC processors, as Apple now intends to focus on its current line of Intel-based products. As support for Rosetta was dropped in OS X Lion, Snow Leopard is the last version of Mac OS X that is able to run PowerPC-only applications. Snow Leopard was succeeded by Mac OS X Lion (version 10.7) on July 20, 2011. Since then, Apple has continued to sell Snow Leopard from its online store for the benefit of users that require Snow Leopard in order to upgrade to later versions of OS X, which have all been distributed through the Mac App Store introduced in the Snow Leopard 10.6.6 update. Snow Leopard is the last release of Mac OS X to support the 32-bit Intel Core Solo and Intel Core Duo CPUs.

They are near the hamlet of Cabra, which is very near Kingscourt (Irish: ''Dún a' Rí'') in south-east County Cavan, Ireland. The current Cabra Castle (located just off the R179, known locally as the Carrickmacross Road) was constructed in a mixture of the \"neo-Norman-style\" and the \"Gothick-style\" in the first decade of the 19th century. Much of the exterior is in a form of what might be described as the \"neo-Norman-style\", while the interior is mainly \"Gothick\" (as opposed to the later neo-Gothic styles). This structure was originally called Cormey (or Cormy) Castle, after the local townland where it was built. It was constructed for the Foster family, a local \"Ascendancy\" family. However, the cost of building the new country house effectively bankrupted the Foster family. So, in 1813, shortly after the new Cormey Castle had been completed, the Fosters sold their new country house to their much wealthier neighbours, the Pratt dynasty, who were another local 'Ascendancy' family. The aristocratic Pratt family lived just across the Carrickmacross Road at the original Cabra House (also sometimes known as Cabra Castle) on the Cabra Estate, the family's huge country estate. The Pratt family had owned the Cabra Estate since 1699. In 1813, Colonel Joseph Pratt added the new Cormey Castle and much of the Fosters' Cormey Estate to his own Cabra Estate. Cormey Castle replaced the original Cabra House as the chief \"seat\" of the Pratt dynasty in County Cavan. Around 1820, the Pratt family renamed Cormey Castle as Cabra Castle, the name it retains to this day. The ruins of the original Cabra House, or Cabra Castle, can be seen on a slight height near the Wishing Well in what is now Dún a' Rí Forest Park, formerly part of the Cabra Estate. The forest park is now owned by Coillte, the Irish Government's forestry company. Major Mervyn Pratt owned Cabra Castle and the Cabra Estate from 1927 until his death in December 1950. The Major, however, mainly lived at Enniscoe, another country estate that the Pratt family had owned since the 1860s near Crossmolina in County Mayo. He was succeeded by his nephew, Tan Sri Dr. Mervyn Sheppard, a long-serving civil servant with the British Colonial Service in Malaya, who was the last member of the Pratt dynasty to own Cabra Castle. Due to the mounting costs of running the castle and running what remained of the Cabra Estate, he sold the country house to a local Catholic family, the Brennans, in 1964. The Brennan family turned the castle into a hotel, which it remained up until they sold it in 1986 to a Mr. Mansour, a senior politician and businessman from the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in the U.A.E. Mansour closed the hotel with the intention of turning Cabra Castle back into a private country house once more. However, he never actually got round to restoring the castle as a private residence or restoring it to its former glory. In 1991, Mansour sold Cabra Castle to the Corscadden family, who run a number of hotels. They restored the castle and turned it into a luxury four-star hotel, reopening it as such in the early 1990s. It continues to be owned by the Corscadden family, and the castle remains a luxury hotel. The castle is very close to County Cavan's border with both County Monaghan and, in particular, County Meath. About a hundred acres of land now makes up the surrounding demesne (or park) of Cabra Castle.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Kenneth Carlsen was the defending champion but lost in the third round to Hyung-Taik Lee.
