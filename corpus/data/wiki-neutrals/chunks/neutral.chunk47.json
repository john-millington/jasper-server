They were formed for a variety of reasons, often because an area was unpopulated or unsuitable for agriculture, but also around institutions and buildings or natural resources. Extra-parochial areas caused considerable problems when they became inhabited as they did not provide religious facilities, local governance or provide for the relief of the poor. Their status was often ambiguous and there was demand for extra-parochial areas to operate more like parishes. Following the introduction of the New Poor Law, extra-parochial areas were effectively made civil parishes by the Extra-Parochial Places Act 1857 and were eliminated by the Poor Law Amendment Act 1868. This was achieved either by being integrated with a neighbouring or surrounding parish, or by becoming a separate civil parish if the population was high enough.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Gurgen I () (died 891) was a Georgian prince of the Bagratid dynasty of Tao-Klarjeti. He was a presiding prince of Iberia with the Byzantine title of curopalates from 881 until his death in a dynastic feud in 891. The oldest son of Prince Adarnase I, Gurgen was baptized by the prominent monk Grigol Khandzteli. He inherited from his father the duchy of Upper Tao, including the residence of Kalmakhi. In the dynastic war which erupted among the Bagratids, Gurgen initially sided with Nasra, who had murdered his cousin David I, the curopalates of Iberia in 881. True to the policy of division and because of the minority of David’s son and legitimate heir Adarnase, the Byzantine court confirmed as curopalate, not Adarnase, but Gurgen. Eventually, Gurgen switched his side and joined Adarnase against Nasra who was defeated and put to death in 888. As a result of the division of Nasra’s inheritance, Gurgen might have added Shavsheti and Artaani to his possessions, for we hear from the 18th-century Georgian chronicler Vakhushti of Gurgen having moved his residence there. In the meantime Adarnase, not being a curopalate and having the example of his Armenian cousins before him, assumed the title of king. The relations between Adarnase and Gurgen grew tense and degenerated into an open warfare. Gurgen was fatally wounded and captured at Mglinavi near Artaani by Adarnase and his ally Bagrat Mampali in 891. According to his will, Gurgen was buried at the monastery of Opiza restored by him. Gurgen was probably married to a daughter of Smbat VIII Bagratuni (826–855), the presiding prince of Armenia. He left two sons behind – Adarnase and Ashot Kukhi – thus being a founder of the Bagratid \"first house of Tao\" which would become extinct with his grandson Gurgen II.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"NGC 7217 is an unbarred spiral galaxy in the constellation Pegasus.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Halewood Body & Assembly is a Jaguar Land Rover production facility in Halewood, Merseyside, England.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Southwest Review is a literary journal published quarterly, based on the Southern Methodist University campus in Dallas, Texas.

The 14th named storm of the 2005 Pacific typhoon season, Nabi formed on August 29 to the east of the Northern Mariana Islands. It moved westward and passed about 55 km (35 mi) north of Saipan on August 31 as an intensifying typhoon. On the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the storm to super typhoon status, with winds equivalent to that of a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The Japan Meteorological Agency estimated peak ten-minute winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) on September 2. Nabi weakened while curving to the north, striking the Japanese island of Kyushu on September 6. After brushing South Korea, the storm turned to the northeast, passing over Hokkaido before becoming extratropical on September 8. The typhoon first affected the Northern Marianas Islands, where it left US$2.5 million in damage, while damaging or destroying 114 homes. The damage was enough to warrant a disaster declaration from the United States government. While passing near Okinawa, Nabi produced gusty winds and caused minor damage. Later, the western fringe of the storm caused several traffic accidents in Busan, South Korea, and throughout the country Nabi killed six people and caused US$115.4 million in damage. About 250,000 people evacuated along the Japanese island of Kyushu ahead of the storm, and there were disruptions to train, ferry, and airline services. In Kyushu, the storm left ¥4.08 billion (US$36.9 million) in crop damage after dropping 1,322 mm (52.0 in) of rain over three days. During the storm's passage, there were 61 daily rainfall records broken by Nabi's precipitation. The rains caused flooding and landslides, forcing people to evacuate their homes and for businesses to close. Across Japan, Nabi killed 29 people and caused ¥94.9 billion (US$854 million) in damage. Soldiers, local governments, and insurance companies helped residents recover from the storm damage. After affecting Japan, the typhoon affected the Kuril Islands of Russia, where it dropped the equivalent of the monthly precipitation, while also causing road damage due to high waves. Overall, Nabi killed 35 people, and its effects were significant enough for the name to be retired.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Paracolobus is an extinct genus of primate in the Colobini tribe, which also contains the living colobus monkeys.

He retired in 1989 but remains active in research in theoretical inorganic chemistry. In 1963 he proposed the qualitative theory of hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) in an attempt to unify the theories of reactivity in inorganic and organic chemistry. In this theory 'Hard' applies to species that are small, have high charge states, and are weakly polarizable. 'Soft' applies to species that are large, have low charge states and are strongly polarizable. Acids and bases interact, and the most stable interactions are hard-hard and soft-soft.

Grapevines, most of which belong to the Vitis vinifera family, produce one crop of fruit each growing season with a limited life span for individual vines. While some centenarian old vine examples of grape varieties exist, most grapevines are between the ages of 10 and 30 years. As vineyard owners seek to replant their vines, a number of techniques are available which may include planting a new cutting that has been selected by either clonal or mass (massal) selection. Vines can also be propagated by grafting a new plant vine upon existing rootstock or by layering one of the canes of an existing vine into the ground next to the vine and severing the connection when the new vine develops its own root system. In commercial viticulture, grapevines are rarely propagated from seedlings as each seed contains unique genetic information from its two parent varieties (the flowering parent and the parent that provided the pollen that fertilized the flower) and would, theoretically, be a different variety than either parent. This would be true even if two hermaphroditic vine varieties, such as Chardonnay, cross pollinated each other. While the grape clusters that would arise from the pollination would be considered Chardonnay any vines that sprang from one of the seeds of the grape berries would be considered a distinct variety other than Chardonnay. It is for this reason that grapevines are usually propagated from cuttings while grape breeders will utilize seedlings to come up with new grape varieties including crossings that include parents of two varieties within the same species (such as Cabernet Sauvignon which is a crossing of the Vitis vinifera varieties Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon blanc) or hybrid grape varieties which include parents from two different Vitis species such as the Armagnac grape Baco blanc, which was propagated from the vinifera grape Folle blanche and the Vitis labrusca variety Noah.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Joseph Borguet (born 16 April 1951) is a former Belgian racing cyclist.

It is the principal contribution of Soviet film theorists to global cinema, and brought formalism to bear on filmmaking. Although Soviet filmmakers in the 1920s disagreed about how exactly to view montage, Sergei Eisenstein marked a note of accord in \"A Dialectic Approach to Film Form\" when he noted that montage is \"the nerve of cinema\", and that \"to determine the nature of montage is to solve the specific problem of cinema\". Its influence is far reaching commercially, academically, and politically. Alfred Hitchcock cites editing (and montage indirectly) as the lynchpin of worthwhile filmmaking. In fact, montage is demonstrated in the majority of narrative fiction film available today. Post-Soviet film theories relied extensively on montage’s redirection of film analysis toward language, a literal grammar of film. A semiotic understanding of film, for example, is indebted to and in contrast with Sergei Eisenstein’s wanton transposition of language “in ways that are altogether new.” While several Soviet filmmakers, such as Lev Kuleshov, Dziga Vertov, Esfir Shub and Vsevolod Pudovkin put forth explanations of what constitutes the montage effect, Eisenstein's view that \"montage is an idea that arises from the collision of independent shots\" wherein \"each sequential element is perceived not next to the other, but on top of the other\" has become most widely accepted. The production of films—how and under what conditions they are made—was of crucial importance to Soviet leadership and filmmakers. Films that focused on individuals rather than masses were deemed counterrevolutionary, but not exclusively so. The collectivization of filmmaking was central to the programmatic realization of the Communist state. Kino-eye forged a film and newsreel collective that sought the dismantling of bourgeois notions of artistry above the needs of the people. Labor, movement, the machinery of life, and the everyday of Soviet citizens coalesced in the content, form, and productive character of Kino-eye repertoire. The bulk of influence, beginning from the October 1917 Revolution until the late 1950s (oftentimes referred to as the Stalin era), brought a cinematic language to the fore and provided the groundwork for contemporary editing and documentary techniques, as well as providing a starting point for more advanced theories.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Event to knowledge (E2K) is an accounting metric that measures the time from when an event occurs to when the responsible person knows about it.

When the English captured Jamaica from the Spanish in 1655, the latter freed their slaves, who fled into the mountainous forests of the interior, where they established free and independent communities, and fought a guerrilla war against the English. The Spanish attempted to retake the island, and to this end Don Christobal de Ysasi relied on his alliance with the Spanish Maroons to secure this victory. However, one of the leaders of the Spanish Maroons, Juan de Bolas, switched sides and joined the English along with his Maroon warriors. In 1660, when Ysasi realised that de Bolas had joined the English, he admitted that the Spanish no longer had a chance of recapturing the island, since de Bolas and his men knew the mountainous interior better than the Spanish and the English. Ysasi gave up on his dreams, and fled to Cuba. Juan de Bolas and his Maroon community was based primarily around the town of Guanaboa Vale. The English named two rivers and a mountain after him to commemorate his assistance in expelling the Spaniards from the island and capturing hostile maroons. The English appointed him Colonel of the Black Militia and guaranteed his palenque land and liberties \"for ever\". There was at least one other group of Spanish Maroons who did not agree to terms with the English authorities, led by a Maroon named Juan de Serras. The English called this group the Karmahaly Maroons, because they came from Los Vermejales. The English colonial authorities then used de Bolas and his \"Black Militia\" to hunt de Serras and his Maroons. De Bolas was killed in an ambush by an unaligned palenque in 1664.

Conservation banking can be viewed as a method of mitigation that allows permitting agencies to target various natural resources typically of value or concern, and it is generally contemplated as a protection technique to be implemented before the valued resource or species will need to be mitigated. The ESA prohibits the \"taking\" of fish and wildlife species which are officially listed as endangered or threatened in their populations. However, under section 7(a)(2) for Federal Agencies, and under section 10(a) for private parties, a take may be permissible for unavoidable impacts if there are conservation mitigation measures for the impacted species or habitat. Purchasing “credits” through a conservation bank is one such mitigation measure to remedy the loss. Conservation banks are permanently protected parcels of land with inherent abilities to harbor, preserve, and manage the survival of endangered and threatened species, along with their critical habitat. This allows the acquisition and protection of the parcels of land prior to future loss or disturbance to valued resources. Banks are often considered to be the more ecologically efficient option for mitigation because they generally incorporate larger tracts of land that enables higher quality habitat and range connectivity, thereby creating a stronger chance of survival and sustainability for the species. Rather than have developments offset their impacts by conserving small areas of habitat, conservation banking allows pooling multiple mitigation resources into a larger reserve. The intention of conservation banking is to create a no-net loss of the intended resources. It should also be noted that conservation banking may be used by various entitles as a method of species and habitat protection, as long as it is approved by the permitting agency.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Chioninia geisthardi (English: '''Geisthard's skink') is a species of skinks in to the Scincidae'' family.

The major disadvantages of compositing are also twofold. The motions composited may, in some respects, be dissimilar: some of their supporters will not wish to vote for some provisions of the combined motion. Some provisions may have to be omitted from the composite motions - to reduce its length or because the supporters of the original motions will not agree to them.

The comic strip began as a weekly in 1990, and ran for five years in the Eugene, Oregon Register-Guard under the name \"Sister City\", before being syndicated. The syndicated daily strip debuted in November 1995. Universal Press syndicate reportedly requested the name change because they felt that the original name might be perceived by some readers as too \"feminist\" in orientation. In October 2015, the strip ceased daily production but Eliot planned to continue producing the Sunday version. The Stone family features a family headed by single mother Val, an uncommon contrast with the ordinary nuclear family depicted in more traditional strips. As the author explained, :When I write I am writing first and foremost for single and working parents. I often felt very isolated and \"put down\" because of my circumstances (I was a single working mom for 10 years). I even had a teacher tell me that their school \"was a better place before all the single moms arrived\". My daughters both turned out fabulously, thank you, and I think I was a good parent. It is common for strip storylines to consist of household squabbles and arguments that are not resolved. Unlike many strips, the characters do age, but at a very slow rate.

The others are Green Acre Bahá'í School and Bosch Bahá'í School. Louhelen is near Davison, Michigan. The school property was bought for Bahá'í purposes in 1930 by the new married couple Lou and Helen Eggleston and they hosted a picnic that year. The first \"school\" session was held in 1931 and was run via a committee organized by the national community through the 1930s and 40s. Innovations in the period were adding distinct sessions for youth and junior youth and practicum \"laboratory\" sessions. All the while the material setting was also advanced. In 1947 the Egglestons donated the school property valued over $50k and the National Spiritual Assembly of the US bought the residence which was organically part of the school. The work of maintaining the site was then kept by two committees and on-site managers though the Egglestons continued to associate with the school into the early 1950s. Lou died in 1953 while their daughter assisted the school in 1955. For a period of two years, however, the school was shut down as were all the Bahá'í schools, in 1949 and 1950 to conserve resources for the cost of finishing the Bahá'í House of Worship in Wilmette and to clearly establish the thrust of work of promulgating the religion in Latin America. Activities resumed and continued through the 1960s into the early 1970s. However a safety situation developed and in 1974 the school was closed by the national assembly. An investment of $1.8 million followed with plans drawn up and construction projects carried out from 1980 to 1982 and the school re-opened with some buildings restored, others replaced and the mission more explicitly being a residential college and conference center. A number of subject areas have been advanced across the periods of the school. One was race unity, a subject at the school explicitly since 1932 when Maye Gift's talks on race lead to a compilation that was well received in multiple reprints. The school welcomed inter-racial couples, members of diverse races, and a project supporting black students going to attend integrating schools in Greenville, SC, in 1964 was undertaken and a socioeconomic development program Understanding Racism initiative in 1986. Books were also developed from other presentations at the school - some of Stanwood Cobb's work was gathered from working for a school session, and the text of The Divine Art of Living evolved from presentations. Moslem and Christian subjects were studied early on. Later a residential college program supported students who stayed at the school and were students in area colleges. Scholars of the religion gathered annually at the school in the form of the Association for Bahá'í Studies and the Irfan Colloquia and attracted performers like Andy Grammar, and Kevin Locke. The school also supported a grandparents-and-grandkids program of learning indigenous Indian cultural history.

Gijsbertus Jacobus (Bert) Sas was born in Leeuwarden. He was named after his father, a soldier who by his pension had reached the rank of lieutenant colonel. His mother Geertrui Huiber was 20 years younger than her husband. Bert was the youngest of 3 children, and attended a secondary school in Leeuwarden. In 1910 he went to the Koninklijke Militaire Academie in Breda. During World War I, in 1917, he was promoted to first lieutenant and married Maria Johanna van der Minne. From 1923 until 1926 he followed the training for staff officier at the Hogere Krijgsschool. After this he obtained another staff function in The Hague. In 1928 he was promoted to the rank of captain and became head of the most important bureau of the 2nd division where all of the important military questions were handled. However, during the period from 1928 until 1936, military expenditure was strictly limited. Between 1936 and 1937 he was the military attaché in Berlin for 10 days per month, spending the remaining 20 days in The Hague. He was then recalled to The Hague, where he functioned as the right-hand man of General Reijnders in the role of head of the operations division. In March 1939, following the German annexation of the Sudetenland, Reijnders sent him back to Berlin. This time he set up residence there with his wife Miep. In Berlin he immediately restored his friendship with the German colonel Hans Oster. Oster had obtained an important position as the right hand of Wilhelm Canaris at the German Abwehr, the espionage and counter-espionage service of the army. They were connected not only through their mutual dislike for the Nazi regime. Their friendship dated from the beginning of the 1930s, when they first met, possibly when Sas was working in The Hague. Oster passed him all important information that he obtained. He did not do this out of sympathy for Sas, but because he considered it his duty to Germany. He did not see himself as a traitor, but someone who did his duty to the decent Germany that he loved. At end of August 1939 he warned The Hague that a war with Poland was about to begin. He gave 25 August 1939 as the invasion date, but this date passed by. At 14:50 on that day Hitler gave the order for the invasion, but revoked it when he heard that England was not going to concede. Sas' credibility suffered. When he reported on 31 August that the war was now close, the head of intelligence, Van der Plassche did not believe him. Sas was the only one who delivered this report: London and Paris gave reassurance. However the Netherlands mobilised at the insistence of Queen Wilhelmina. General Reijnders, still his superior in The Hague, was positive over Sas' information. His relationship with General Reijnders remained good as long as the neutrality of Netherlands was not discussed. During September and October 1939, Sas obtained more signals that the neutrality of the Netherlands would not remain inviolate. Oster, during this time, assured him that only Belgium would be the target. However Sas did not believe this. At his insistence, Oster obtained further information from the German headquarters in Zossen. This showed that the suspicions that Sas now had were correct: the Netherlands would be invaded together with Belgium. The violation of neutrality would not be limited to a passage through southern Limburg into Belgium. Sas died in the 1948 KLM Constellation air disaster in Scotland.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Case Western Reserve University School of Law is one of eight schools at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.

Berkelius supposes that an error had crept into the text, and that for we should read . Its identification with Rhithymna was first proposed by Eckhel. Georges Le Rider in 1968 established from numismatic evidence that the city of Rithymna was refounded at some point in the 3rd Century BCE as Arsinoe. The evidence entails similar series of coins with the names of each city as well as find spots for the Arsinoe coins being in the regions around Rithymna. The exact refoundation date is less sure but Le Rider puts it in the reign of Ptolemy Philometer. Roger S. Bagnall notes that this may be the same Arsinoe that appears as a Cretan city in a Magnesian inscription (I. Magn. 21 8) of 200 BCE. Bagnall says that the city of Rithymna reverted to its original name by the time of the Delphic Theorodoktoi lists of the early 2nd century BCE.

The codex, written at the end or even in the middle of the 10th century, contains a menaion for the month of March, intersecting with the movable cycle of Easter. It also contains 24 lives of saints, 23 homilies and one prayer, most of which were written by or are attributed to John Chrysostom. The 284-folio (or 285-folio, according to some sources) codex was \"discovered\" in 1823 by Canon Michał Bobrowski in the Uniate Basilian monastery in Supraśl. In 1838, Bobrowski sent the last part of the manuscript in two pieces to Slovene philologist Jernej Kopitar so that he could transcribe it. After Kopitar returned it, Bobrowski sent him the first part (118 folios), however for unknown reason it was never returned to Bobrowski and was found in 1845 among the documents of the deceased Kopitar. It was later kept by the Ljubljana Lyceum and now by the National and University Library of Slovenia in Ljubljana. The largest part was bought for the private library of the Zamoyski family in Warsaw. This part of the codex disappeared during World War II, but later resurfaced in the United States and was returned by Herbert Moeller to Poland in 1968, where it has been held by the National Library of Poland in Warsaw until the present day. The third part, consisting of 16 folios, is held by the Russian National Library in Saint Petersburg.

According to Abhinavagupta, the aesthetic experience is the manifestation of the innate dispositions of the self, such as love and sorrow, by the self. It is characterised by the contemplation of the bliss of the self by the connoisseur. It is akin to the spiritual experience as one transcends the limitations of one's limited self because of the process of universalisation taking place during the aesthetic contemplation of characters depicted in the work of art. Abhinavagupta maintains that this rasa (literally, taste or essence, the final outcome) is the summum bonum of all literature.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Karl Kae Knecht (December 4, 1883 – July 28, 1972) was an American artist who was the cartoonist for the Evansville Courier (now Courier & Press) from 1906 to 1960 and was instrumental in the founding of Evansville's Mesker Park Zoo.

It was a compact and mixed residential area which included some grand mansion blocks of flats, large runs of typical London terraced houses, and some areas of working class housing.

The \"Writer’s Club\" expressed interest in \"folksongs and literary material to be found in Missouri,\" as reported in the M.S.U. Independent on March 6, 1903. The State Historical Society of Missouri had recently opened its library in what is now Jesse Hall, and the cultural moment had arrived for the development of a new academic field which would blend the materials and methods of many traditional disciplines – philology, literature and history as well as connecting to the newer fields of sociology and anthropology. In literature, the movement that would come to be known as “local color” and the political disposition known as populism worked together to prosper an interest in what Ralph Waldo Emerson had called for, long ago, in a genuinely American literary culture: rejecting “the courtly muses of Europe” in favor of “the near, the low, the common.” The students of the English Club conceived of what would now be called a project in fieldwork and salvage ethnography; aware that sociological trends did not favor the preservation of materials of limited distribution and held in oral tradition, and probably feeling, as some Midwestern students perhaps continue to do, that their own culture hardly qualified as such in the eyes of more prestigious institutions on the Eastern seaboard, they proposed to gather the lore of Missouri into bound volumes, as an archive for future researchers. This collection project, with leadership from the English Club’s faculty sponsor, Henry Marvin Belden and its secretary-treasurer, Maude Williams, would form the basis for the Society’s single most-cited work, Ballads and Songs Collected by the Missouri Folklore Society, published  in 1940 ( second edition, 1955; reprinted 1966 and 1973). The collection project was an item of discussion at the 1905 meeting of the Modern Language Society in Chicago, where the fact that ancient ballads continued to be sung in rural areas was received as something of a revelation, though one to which the “popular antiquities” orientation of incipient folklore studies was favorably disposed. In addition to a very local sort of patriotism, the primary warrant for preserving a given text was that it could be traced to a prior tradition (especially one documentable in the British Isles, ideally in Thomas Percy’s 1765 Reliques of Ancient English Poetry or the English and Scottish Popular Ballads (1882-98) of Francis James Child. Belden published results of his students’ researches in Modern Philology and the Journal of American Folklore, and the club had achieved sufficient stability as to establish itself officially on December 15, 1906. The innovations here are numerous: the recognition of fieldwork as an academic enterprise, the development of collection and archiving protocols, and the participation of undergraduates in original research (a novelty which lies behind such projects as the Foxfire books, Bittersweet and  The Chariton Collector). Early proceedings indicate keen awareness of the dual orientations of the society, both to literature and to anthropology. From an early date, there was recognition of the need to collect the lore of the state’s Black and Native American communities. The Missouri Folklore Society provided the impetus (and expertise) for other such organizations, notably the Texas Folklore Society. Belden became prominent in national folklore circles, serving as president of the American Folklore Society and working closely with such period luminaries as the anthropologist Franz Boas and the literary scholar George Lyman Kittredge – again testifying to the new discipline's divided identity. Unfortunately, nothing came of the American Folklore Society’s plans, much discussed in 1917, to publish the Missouri collection (which was substantially what it would be on its 1940 appearance). The Society did not participate in the virtual explosion of amateur and academic activity, the formation of organizations and the implementation of collection projects, which extended through the 1920s and 30s. As a result of a combination of factors, including disappointment over the derailment of the organization’s signature project, but perhaps primarily because of a failure of continuity in leadership and philosophy, the Society \"fell into a coma in 1920 from which it has not recovered.\" Belden became increasingly busy with administrative duties and other research projects, as was the case too with what then seemed a fine choice for Belden’s successor, Archer Taylor. Mary Alicia Owen, the most prominent of early Missouri collectors and for decades a leader in the Society, did not share Belden’s focused enthusiasm for folksong, preferring to cast the net much more broadly. For these and other reasons, the Society as such effectively went silent until 1977, though Missouri folklorists certainly remained active, and Missouri folklore continued to be collected and studied by such as Ward Dorrance, Vance Randolph, Joseph Carrière, R.P. Christeson, Rosemary Thomas and others. A group consisting mainly of University of Missouri faculty met on March 30, 1977 for the re-activation of the Society. The re-incarnation of MFS, led by Adolph and Rebecca Schroeder, Don Holliday and Cathy Barton (among others), was well-prepared with broad publicity and grass-roots participation from throughout the state. The basic frameworks for the annual Missouri Folklore Society Journal (long edited by Donald Lance) and the statewide meeting, to be held each year in a different part of the state, with such prominent keynote speakers as Roger Abrahams and Max Hunter, were established. Perhaps most importantly for the continued existence and success of the Society, there was an explicit recognition of the need to participate in multiple networks of likeminded organizations (for example the Ozarks States Folklore Society), and above all to recognize the legitimate participation of a variety of constituencies and stakeholders in folklore: academic scholars, certainly, but also performers, tradition-bearers, informants -- \"amateurs\" in the truest and best sense of the word. Each annual meeting has had presentations and participation by such scholars of international standing as John Miles Foley,  Elaine Lawless, Barry Bergey, Alain Jabbour and Jan Harold Brunvand, as well as reports on collection-efforts by students and members of local historical societies, remembrance sessions, presentations on crafts, and music sessions. The Society has, at the century mark, its largest membership in history, a well-trafficked website which includes a growing repository of studies and documents (Missouri Folklore Studies) and a journal now well past the quarter-century mark.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Cal Schake was an Olympic weightlifter for the United States.

The name comes from the remora, a small fish that can attach itself to larger marine life, and has the backronym \"Really Excellent Method Of Rescuing Aussies\". Remora was constructed by OceanWorks International of North Vancouver, British Columbia for the RAN, based on a diving bell. The vehicle was designed to mate with a submarine's escape tower, and could do this even if the submarine had rolled up to 60 degrees from vertical. The vehicle can operate at depths over 500 m and in currents of up to 3 kn, and was intended for use below 180 m; the maximum safe depth for Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment. The submersible carried seven people: an onboard operator and six passengers. Those aboard Remora were kept under about five bars of pressure, and rescued submariners exited into one of two 36-man recompression chambers carried aboard the rescue ship. Remora could be controlled from a containerised facility aboard the rescue ship, with power, control, and sensors fed through an armoured umbilical cable. Twelve personnel make up the surface control complement, with this number supplemented by underwater medicine specialists and divers. The entire setup (Remora, control centre, and recompression chambers) could be transported by road or sea, or loaded into C-130 Hercules aircraft. Remora could be delivered to anywhere in Australia within 36 hours, and installed on a suitable vessel in another 25 hours. The Defence Maritime Services tender Seahorse Spirit was designated the main tender for Remora, although any vessel with sufficient space to carry and deploy the equipment ( of deck space, with 8 m minimum width) could be used. In December 2006, the umbilical cable parted during an exercise off Perth, trapping two men at a depth of 140 m for 12 hours. The men were rescued, but Remora was not recovered until April 2007. The submersible was sent back to OceanWorks for repairs. Although repairs were completed, Remora did not reenter service as the Det Norske Veritas classification society refused to certify the submersible; the launch and recovery equipment did not meet updated safety standards. As of the end of 2008, Remora was in storage at Henderson, Western Australia. To cover the capability loss, the Department of Defence arranged for the British LR5 submersible to be flown to Australia if submarine rescue was required. In June 2009, LR5 was relocated to Australia on lease.

Weinstein (born June 26, 1960) is a Swiss composer active in America. Weinstein has written music for all major genres of art music—with the exception of opera—though he is primarily known for his works for wind ensemble. His style melds the lightness of Mozart with the rhythmic complexity of Stravinsky, and, while his music is fundamentally tonal, he employ's twelve tone techniques to create tension and ambiguity. Weinstein's music has been performed throughout America, Europe and Russia. His Concerto for Wind Ensemble (1989) was recorded by Eugene Corporon and the Cincinnati Wind Ensemble for the Klavier label. He has received numerous commissions including the Chamber Symphony (commissioned by the American Composer's Forum, 2005) the Serenade for Twelve Instruments (commissioned by New England Conservatory, 2000; published by Boosey & Hawkes), The Roman Odes (commissioned by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2001.)and Two Elegies (commissioned by the USAF Band, Washington, DC, 1998) among others. Reviewing the premiere of Weinstein’s Concerto for Horn, Anthony Tommasini described Weinsteins’s music: “The harmonic language is tonal; the style is neoclassical in the tradition of Copland, with a sometimes fractured phrase structure that suggests Stravinsky. The textures and interweavings of contrapuntal lines are clear and unmysterious. . .the score is capably crafted and the audience was taken with it. Reviewing the premiere of the Concerto for Wind Ensemble, Richard Buell wrote in the Boston Globe, “. . .this big, massive piece showed poise, finish, clear-headedness, an attractive fascination with line.
