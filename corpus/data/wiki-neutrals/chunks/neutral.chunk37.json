{"lines":[{"value":"Batyrosaurus is an extinct genus of herbivorous basal hadrosauroid dinosaur known from the Late Cretaceous Bostobinskaya Formation (Santonian to Campanian stage) of central Kazakhstan. It contains a single species, Batyrosaurus rozhdestvenskyi. It is possible that Batyrosaurus represents the same taxon as the doubtful Arstanosaurus akkurganensis as both were found from the same formation. The type species Batyrosaurus rozhdestvenskyi was in 2012 named and described by Pascal Godefroit, François Escuillié, Yuri Bolotsky and Pascaline Lauters. The generic name is derived from the Batyr, the Kazakh hero warriors. The specific name honours Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky. The holotype, AEHM 4/1, was found near Akkurgan in a layer of the Bostobinskaya Formation dating from the Santonian-Campanian, about eight-four millions year old. It consists of a partial skeleton, including a partial skull, the lower jaws, sixty individual teeth, the sterna, the right humerus, the left radius, metacarpals and phalanges. The authors considered Arstanosaurus akkurganensis a nomen dubium and did not refer its material. Batyrosaurus is a medium-sized hadrosauroid of about five to six metres length. Several autapomorphies, unique derived traits, were established. The parietal bones at their rear form bony flaps that overlap the supraoccipital but do not touch the sides of the paraoccipitals and are themselves overlapped by the squamosals. The frontal bones are elongated, about 70% longer than wide. The outer side of the front branch of the jugal shows a deep horizontal trough below the suture with the lacrimal. The joint surface of the surangular is pierced by a foramen. Among the material found was an about four centimetres long thumb claw. A cast was made of the braincase, showing fine arterial impressions on its inner surface, indicating it was almost completely filled by brain tissue. A cladistic analysis showed that Batyrosaurus had a basal position in the Hadrosauroidea, above Altirhinus but below Probactrosaurus in the evolutionary tree. As Tethyshadros in their analysis was a hadrosaurid, the authors considered Batyrosaurus to be the youngest known non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid. This was seen as an indication that not only hadrosauroids but also hadrosaurids originally developed in Asia and only later migrated to North-America.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Benivar () may refer to:","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Divvy is a bicycle sharing system in the City of Chicago and two adjacent suburbs operated by Motivate for the Chicago Department of Transportation.

This age may represent the age of the Earth’s accretion, of core formation, or of the material from which the Earth formed. This dating is based on evidence from radiometric age-dating of meteorite material and is consistent with the radiometric ages of the oldest-known terrestrial and lunar samples. Following the development of radiometric age-dating in the early 20th century, measurements of lead in uranium-rich minerals showed that some were in excess of a billion years old. The oldest such minerals analyzed to date—small crystals of zircon from the Jack Hills of Western Australia—are at least 4.404 billion years old. Calcium–aluminium-rich inclusions—the oldest known solid constituents within meteorites that are formed within the Solar System—are 4.567 billion years old, giving a lower limit for the age of the solar system. It is hypothesised that the accretion of Earth began soon after the formation of the calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions and the meteorites. Because the exact amount of time this accretion process took is not yet known, and the predictions from different accretion models range from a few million up to about 100 million years, the exact age of Earth is difficult to determine. It is also difficult to determine the exact age of the oldest rocks on Earth, exposed at the surface, as they are aggregates of minerals of possibly different ages.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Berloz is a Walloon municipality located in the Belgian province of Liège.

The Caucus was formed several years after the demise of The Waffle, an earlier left-wing faction which had been forced to leave the NDP in the mid-1970s. It was formed by 150 to 200 members in the lead up to the NDP's 1979 federal convention to which it proposed a series of radical resolutions promoting greater public ownership of the economy and other socialist and left-wing measures. John Rodriguez, Member of Parliament for Nickel Belt, was the leading spokesperson for the caucus. Another notable founding member of the Left Caucus was Ontario NDP MPP and future provincial finance minister Floyd Laughren. Rodriguez said the caucus different from the Waffle in that its ultra-left elements were a minor part and as it was willing to abide by the final resolutions of the convention, whether it agrees with them or not. However, Rodriguez warned that the Left Caucus would be outspoken if resolutions it favours passed the convention but were ignored by the party's leadership. The only one of the caucus' resolutions to be approved by the 1979 convention, however, was one protesting the jail sentence handed to Jean-Claude Parrot, president of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers for leading a wildcat strike. In 1981, the Left Caucus opposed Bob Rae's successful candidacy for the leadership of the Ontario NDP backing MPP Richard Johnston instead. Prior to the 1983 federal convention, the Left Caucus again pushed for the party to adopt an economic policy focussed on nationalization of industry and issued a document decrying \"the half-measures of a mixed economy\" and calling for \"a socialist industrial strategy based on public sector ownership of the decisive sectors of the economy.\" The caucus unsuccessfully opposed the adoption of a new \"statement of principles\" by the NDP in 1983 which watered down the party's commitment to socialism and the planned economy. In the mid-1980s the Caucus was involved with the Campaign for an Activist Party which attempted unsuccessfully to elect a slate led by Judy Rebick to the executive of the Ontario NDP. Simon Rosenblum, later a vice-president of the ONDP and chief of staff to provincial finance minister Floyd Laughren, was a leader of the caucus in the early 1980s and authored a resolution that called on an NDP government to use \"the central role of public ownership in the development of our primary resource industries\". By the end of the 1980s the Left Caucus was led by members of the \"Forward\" Group such as Gord Doctorow, Wayne Roberts, Harry Kopyto and George Ehring. The Caucus declined from 1990 to 1995 while the Ontario NDP was in government under Bob Rae with publication of the Left Caucus Newsletter ceasing in 1994.

Like the modern guitar, it was manipulated at the neck to get different notes, and picked or strummed with a plectrum (the citole's was long, thick, straight and likely made of ivory or wood). Although it was largely out of use by the late 14th century, the Italians \"re-introduced it in modified form\" in the 16th Century as the cetra (cittern in English), and it was possibly ancestral to the guitar as well. It was also a pioneering instrument in England, introducing the populace to necked, plucked instruments, giving people the concepts needed to quickly switch to the newly arriving lutes and gitterns. Two possible descendant instrument are the Portuguese guitar and the Corsican Cetera, both types of cittern. It is known today mainly from art and literary sources. Early examples include Provençal poetry (there called the citola) from the 12th Century; however it was more widely displayed in medieval artwork during the 13th and 14th Centuries in manuscript miniatures and in sculpture. The art did not show uniformly shaped instrument, but instead an instrument with numerous variations. The variety shown in art has led the instrument to be called \"ambiguous\". From the artwork, scholars know that it was generally a four-string instrument, and could have anything from a \"holly-leaf\" to a rounded guitar shaped body (that can be called a \"T-shaped\" body). While paintings and sculpture exist, only one instrument has survived the centuries. The sole survivor, associated with Warwick Castle, was made around 1290–1300. It is now preserved in the British Museum's collection. At some point, probably in the sixteenth century, it was converted into a violin-type instrument with a tall bridge, 'f'-holes and angled fingerboard; thus, the instrument's top is not representative of its original appearance. That instrument contributed to a great deal of confusion. It was labeled a violin in the 18th century, a gittern in the early 20th century and finally a citole, beginning after 1977. That confusion is itself illustrative of the confusion about the nature of citoles and gitterns; once the instruments and their traditions were gone, scholars in later centuries didn't know which images and sculpture went with which names from poetry and other literature. Additionally, scholars have translated passages in such a way that literature itself can not always be trusted. One example cited by the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica: a specific reference to the citole may be found in Wycliffe's Bible (1360) in 2 Samuel vi. 5: \"Harpis and sitols and tympane\". However, the Authorized Version has psaltiries, and the Vulgate lyrae. The Britannica also supposed that the citole has been supposed to be another name for the psaltery, a box-shaped instrument often seen in the illuminated missals of the Middle Ages, also liable to confusion with the gittern. Whether the terms overlapped in medieval usage has been the subject of modern controversy. The controversy of citole versus gittern was largely resolved in a 1977 article by Lawrence Wright, called The Medieval Gittern and Citole: A Case of Mistaken Identity.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Kaski District (, a part of Province No. 4, is one of the seventy-six districts of Nepal.

She is best known for the role she played in the creation of the Algerian flag. One of nine children, Émilie grew up in the working-class town of Neuves-Maisons in Eastern France where her father worked in the local steel mill. Her father was involved in anarcho-syndicalism and she was engaged politically from an early age. She moved to Paris and worked in a department store before meeting a young Algerian migrant and political activist, Messali Hadj. As was often the case for working-class couples, they moved in together without officially getting married. Their partnership, which produced two children, was marked by a shared commitment to progressive and anticolonial causes. During Messali's long spells in prison, Émilie often spoke on his behalf and used her position as a Frenchwoman to pour particular scorn on France's declared commitment to \"civilising\" Algeria. She is perhaps best known as the creator of the Algerian flag. While there is some dispute over who exactly designed green and white with red star and crescent symbol, Émilie is generally credited as having sewed the first version of the flag.

The Atlantic salmon and trout of the genus Salmo give the family and order their names. Salmonids have a relatively primitive appearance among the teleost fish, with the pelvic fins being placed far back, and an adipose fin towards the rear of the back. They are slender fish, with rounded scales and forked tails. Their mouths contain a single row of sharp teeth. Although the smallest species is just long as an adult, most are much larger, with the largest reaching . All salmonids spawn in fresh water, but in many cases, the fish spend most of their lives at sea, returning to the rivers only to reproduce. This lifecycle is described as anadromous. They are predators, feeding on small crustaceans, aquatic insects, and smaller fish.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Johnston is a town in Edgefield County, South Carolina, United States.

He is the sole inventor of a groundbreaking quasi-optimal error-correcting coding scheme called Turbo codes as evidenced by the sole inventorship credit given on the fundamental patent for turbo codes. The original patent filing for turbo codes issued in the US as US Patent 5,446,747. A 1993 paper entitled \"Near Shannon Limit Error-correcting Coding and Decoding: Turbo-codes\" published in the Proceedings of IEEE International Communications Conference was the first public disclosure of turbo codes. This 1993 paper listed three authors because it was formed from three separate submissions that were combined due to space constraints. The three authors listed on the 1993 paper are: Berrou, Glavieux, and Thitimajshima. Because the 1993 paper was the first public introduction of turbo codes (patents remain unpublished until issued), coinventorship credit for the discovery to turbo code is often erroneously given to Glavieux and/or Thitimajshima. While Berrou and Glavieux did go on to do supplemental work together, the original development of turbo codes was performed by Berrou alone. Berrou also codeveloped turbo equalization (see turbo equalizer.) Turbo equalization is also known as iterative reception or iterative detection. Turbo Codes have been used in all the major cellular communications standards since 3G and are currently part of the LTE (Long Term Evolution) cellular protocol. They are also used in the Inmarsat satellite communications protocol and well as the DVB-RCS and DVB-RCS2 communications protocols. Hard disk drives started using turbo equalization for their read channel in 2008. By 2012 all hard disk drives used turbo equalization and this remains the case as of 2016.

He is known for his service to the British South Africa Company and to the British Army in colonial Africa, and for teaching woodcraft to Robert Baden-Powell in Rhodesia. He helped inspire the founding of the international Scouting Movement. Burnham was born on a Dakota Sioux Indian reservation in Minnesota where he learned the ways of American Indians as a boy. By the age of 14, he was supporting himself in California, while also learning scouting from some of the last of the cowboys and frontiersmen of the American Southwest. Burnham had little formal education, never finishing high school. After moving to the Arizona Territory in the early 1880s, he was drawn into the Pleasant Valley War, a feud between families of ranchers and sheepherders. He escaped and later worked as a civilian tracker for the United States Army in the Apache Wars. Feeling the need for new adventures, Burnham took his family to southern Africa in 1893, seeing Cecil Rhodes's Cape to Cairo Railway project as the next undeveloped frontier. Burnham distinguished himself in several battles in Rhodesia and South Africa and became Chief of Scouts. Despite his U.S. citizenship, his military title was British and his rank of major was formally given to him by King Edward VII. In special recognition of Burnham's heroism, the King invested him into the Companions of the Distinguished Service Order, giving Burnham the highest military honors earned by any American in the Second Boer War. He had become friends with Baden-Powell during the Second Matabele War in Rhodesia, teaching him outdoor skills and inspiring what would later become known as Scouting. Burnham returned to the United States, where he became involved in national defense efforts, business, oil, conservation, and the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). During World War I, Burnham was selected as an officer and recruited volunteers for a U.S. Army division similar to the Rough Riders, which Theodore Roosevelt intended to lead into France. For political reasons, the unit was disbanded without seeing action. After the war, Burnham and his business partner John Hays Hammond formed the Burnham Exploration Company; they became wealthy from oil discovered in California. Burnham joined several new wilderness conservation organizations, including the California State Parks Commission. In the 1930s, he worked with the BSA to save the big horn sheep from extinction. This effort led to the creation of the Kofa and Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuges in Arizona. He earned the BSA's highest honor, the Silver Buffalo Award, in 1936, and remained active in the organization at both the regional and national level until his death in 1947. To symbolise the friendship between Burnham and Baden-Powell, the mountain beside Mount Baden-Powell in California was formally named Mount Burnham in 1951.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Tuscawilla Plantation was a large cotton plantation of located in eastern Leon County, Florida, United States established by George W.

As a member of the Board's Steel Division, he saw a Sendzimir Cold Rolling Mill in operation and began to appreciate its potential value for rolling stainless steel into thin, high-accuracy sheets. Washington Steel began production in 1947, with a 39-inch Z-mill much wider than any previously produced (it cost $278,000, installed). The light-gauge stainless steel had exceptional dimensional accuracy and surface quality, and in its first year of operation the company posted net income of $237,000. Sales in 1948 were $4.6 million, and by 1954 more than quadrupled to $19 million.

The book presents a chronological history of censorship from Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome and the Middle Ages to the present. It discusses notable censored works, including Ulysses by James Joyce, ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' by D. H. Lawrence and the seven dirty words monologue by comedian George Carlin. Heins discusses censorship aimed at youth in the United States through legislation including the Children's Internet Protection Act and the Communications Decency Act. The author explores the question of whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to media deemed inappropriate by adults (including violence and pornography), arguing that youths are not endangered by sexually explicit material. Heins asserts that there is no simple tactic by which the government can censor material from children without violating rights guaranteed adults by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She points out that although the view of sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven, the fear of its impact is used to support morality-based arguments; appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually has the unintended consequence of harming them. Not in Front of the Children received the Eli M. Oboler Award in 2002 from the American Library Association as the \"Best Published Work on Intellectual Freedom\".

Plutarch reports that in 406BC the lake surged over the surrounding hills, despite there being no rain nor tributaries flowing into the lake to account for the rise in water level. The ensuing flood destroyed fields and vineyards before eventually pouring into the sea. It is thought to have been caused by volcanic gases, trapped in sediment at the bottom of the lake and gradually building up until suddenly releasing, causing the water to overflow. Around 395BC, during the wars between Rome and Veii, a discharge tunnel was built crossing the crater walls. It served as an emissary whenever the water level overflowed its mouth. According to Titus Livius, this feat of engineering was incited by the Oracle of Delphi: the Roman victory against Veii would be possible only when the lake waters were channeled and used for irrigation.

The company is headquartered in Chiswick. Compass Box Whisky was founded in 2000 by American entrepreneur John Glaser, a former marketing director at Johnnie Walker. Their main product line, called the Signature Range, consists of whiskies named 'The Spice Tree', 'The Peat Monster', 'Oak Cross', 'Asyla' and 'Hedonism'. Outside the Signature Range, they produce a range of Blended Scotch whiskies called 'Great King Street', within which there are two products: 'Artist's Blend' (a rich, round, fruity blend) and 'Glasgow Blend' (a bold, smoky, sherried whisky made in the style historically favoured by Glaswegians). They have also released several Limited Edition releases, such as 'Hedonism Maximus', 'Flaming Heart', 'Optimism', 'Morpheus' and the Canto Cask series. Apart from whiskies, they also produce 'Orangerie', made from whisky infused with orange zest and spices. The company's whiskymakers select distillates from a number of existing Scotch whisky distilleries, with the selected whiskies then being blended together and the resulting blend matured further. Controversy and Innovation In 2005 Compass Box released a new Blended Malt Scotch Whisky called The Spice Tree in which the blend of single malt distillates had undergone a secondary partial maturation stage in casks containing additional, flat French oak inserts (also known as ‘inner staves’). The Scotch Whisky Association, a trade organisation that represents the Scotch whisky industry, felt that the use of such inner staves in the whisky maturation process was in contravention of the Scotch Whisky Regulations prevailing at the time and threatened legal action against Compass Box to halt the production of The Spice Tree. In response, Compass Box altered the production process for subsequent releases of The Spice Tree wherein the secondary maturation stage takes place in casks containing toasted French oak heads instead of the flat oak inner staves. More recently, in 2015 Compass Box again disagreed with The Scotch Whisky Association when it attempted to release complete information about every component whisky used in its blends - a step which the Scotch Whisky Association claimed was prohibited by both EU and UK laws. In response, Compass Box launched a 'Scotch Whisky Transparency' campaign to encourage greater transparency within the world of Scotch with other Scotch whisky producers - notably Bruichladdich - subsequently joining them in sharing full age component information about one or more of their blends.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Media reform refers to proposed attempts to reform mass media towards an agenda which is more in tune with public needs and away from a perceived bias toward corporate (or, in many cases, government or political) biases.

From a Roman Catholic family, he was educated at Christian Brothers' College, Perth, and subsequently held a variety of jobs in country Western Australia, including as a clerk at Wyndham, a Public Works Department paymaster at Kondinin, and a wharfinger and general merchant at Roebourne.

He defeated the sitting Nationalist member, John Church, who had only been elected to parliament in a by-election the previous year. Although Labor was in government from the 1933 election through to the 1947 election, Rodoreda was not a member of any of the ministries led by Philip Collier, John Willcock, and Frank Wise.

Following Labor's return to government at the 1953 election, Rodoreda was elected speaker. He presided over a \"heavy legislative programme\", with the new premier, Albert Hawke, passing a record number of bills in the first session of the new parliament despite conflict with the Legislative Council. Following the Labor candidate's defeat at the 1955 Bunbury by-election, Rodoreda's position as speaker meant Hawke's government was reduced to a minority in the Legislative Assembly. A motion of no confidence failed to pass, however, and Labor gained a three-seat majority at the 1956 election. Rodoreda was replaced as speaker by James Hegney, but remained in parliament until his death in Melbourne in March 1958. Labor's Arthur Bickerton won Pilbara at the resulting by-election, elected unopposed.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Helicostyla ticaonica is a species of medium-sized, air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Bradybaenidae.

However, the term was often ascribed generally to anti-slavery operations during the period leading up to the American Civil War. The squadron was an outgrowth of the 1819 treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom that was an early step in stopping the trade, and further defined by the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842. Although technically coordinated with a British West Africa Squadron based in Sierra Leone, in practice the American contingent worked on its own. The squadron also lacked support from the navy itself: Secretary of the Navy Abel Parker Upshur (1790–1844) was a Southerner and an extreme supporter of states' rights and slavery, and assigned only a handful of ships mounting a total of 80 guns between them. Matthew Perry was the first commander of the squadron, and based himself in Portuguese Cape Verde. The squadron was generally ineffective, since the ships were too few, and since much of the trading activity had shifted to the Niger River delta area (present-day Nigeria), which was not being covered. In the two years of Perry's leadership, only one slaver was reported to have been captured, and that ship was later acquitted by a New Orleans court. In the 16 years of squadron operation, only the crews of 19 slave ships went to trial. These slavers were acquitted or only lightly fined. Other commanders, however, were more successful.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"David Jenkins Ward (September 17, 1871 – February 18, 1961), a Democrat, was a U.S. Congressman.

The early nave from 1129 survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries because an agreement in 1374 between the Abbot of Tewkesbury and the parishioners stated that the nave would become the parishioners responsibility, and the tower was added around 1374. On 9 January 1540 the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII meant that St James Priory was surrendered to the crown. The priory buildings were demolished, keeping only the nave of the church. In 1543 the land and the right to hold a fair were sold to a London merchant-tailor. In 1604 there was concern that the national attraction of St James' Fair would increase the spread of the plague, so a royal proclamation was issued prohibiting Londoners from attending. The south aisle was widened and rebuilt in 1698. The porch dates from the late 18th century, and the north aisle was rebuilt in 1864. The traditional account, as told to John Leland, has it that every tenth stone brought from Normandy to build the Castle was set aside to build the Priory.
