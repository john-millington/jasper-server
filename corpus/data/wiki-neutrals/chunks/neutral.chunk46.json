Men's swimming has been part of the Summer Olympics since the Games' modern inception in 1896; it was not until 1912 that women competed against each other. The swimming events at the 1896 Olympic Games were held in a bay in the Aegean Sea with swimmers being required to swim to the shore—Hungarian swimmer Alfréd Hajós won two gold medals that year, saying \"My will to live completely overcame my desire to win.\" The 1900 Games in Paris saw the swimming events take place in the River Seine while the events at the 1908 Summer Olympics were hosted in a 100-metre pool located within an athletics track in the White City Stadium in London. Races are held in four swimming categories: freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly, over varying distances and in either individual or relay race events. Medley swimming races are also held, both individually and in relays, in which all four swimming categories are used. In the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, both men and women competed in sixteen events in the pool, each sex in the same events with the exceptions of the 800 m freestyle (women-only) and the 1500 m freestyle (men-only).

The material is rarely found and apparently is sourced from only one known location at Spring Hill near Lauriston, Victoria. There is another historical reference to a source at Green Hill near Trentham, Victoria, but the exact location has not been confirmed. Daniel James Mahony described ''...water worn pebbles of pitchstone, a highly silicious volcanic glass associated with tachylite on the Coliban River. Mitchell refers to the distribution of the material with: Small artefacts are common at Willaura, Burrumbeet, Inverleigh, Point Cook and as far north as Dooen near Horsham''. Tachylite is a type of volcanic opaque glass, and is applied to basalts with a glassy matrix that contain scattered small phenocrysts (pyroxene, plagioclase, olivine). Aboriginal artefacts flaked from the material are characterised by a black internal colour, which is very often patinated on the surface to a pale grey. This patina rapidly darkens on contact with the skin, turning as dark as the core. Only a few pieces are generally found in archaeological assemblages in southern Victoria and around Melbourne, apart from at sites near Spring Hill, Kyneton, where it is the most common material. Tachylite artefacts have been noted in Aboriginal sites in Victoria from at least the 1920s, when W. .H Gill recorded its occurrence in a large stone artefact and camp site complex at Cape Liptrap.

It grew out of resistance to the military junta led by Siad Barre during the 1980s. By 1988–90, the Somali Armed Forces began engaging various armed rebel groups, including the Somali Salvation Democratic Front in the northeast, the Somali National Movement in the northwest, and the United Somali Congress in the south. The clan-based armed opposition groups eventually managed to overthrow the Barre government in 1991. Various armed factions began competing for influence in the power vacuum and turmoil that followed, particularly in the south. In 1990–92 customary law temporarily collapsed due to the fighting. This precipitated the arrival of UNOSOM I UN military observers in July 1992, followed by larger peacekeeping forces. Factional fighting continued in the south. In the absence of a central government, Somalia became a \"failed state\". ; ; The UN withdrew in 1995, having incurred significant casualties, but no central authority had yet been reestablished. After the collapse of the central government, there was some return to customary and religious law in most regions. In 1991 and 1998, two autonomous regional governments were also established in the northern part of the country. This led to a relative decrease in the intensity of the fighting, with SIPRI removing Somalia from its list of major armed conflicts for the years 1997 and 1998. In 2000, the Transitional National Government was established, followed by the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in 2004. The trend towards reduced conflict halted in 2005, and sustained and destructive conflict took place in the south in 2005–07. However, the fighting was of a much lower scale and intensity than in the early 1990s. In 2006, Ethiopian troops seized most of the south from the newly formed Islamic Courts Union (ICU). The ICU then splintered into more radical groups, notably Al-Shabaab, which have since been fighting the Somali government and the AU-mandated AMISOM peacekeeping force for control of the country. Somalia topped the annual Fragile States Index for six years between 2008 and 2013. In October 2011, following preparatory meetings, Kenyan troops entered southern Somalia (\"Operation Linda Nchi\") to fight Al-Shabaab, and to establish a buffer zone inside Somalia. Kenyan troops were formally integrated into the multinational force in February 2012. The Federal Government of Somalia was later established in August 2012, constituting the first permanent central government in the country since the start of the civil war.

Harris,, was a case in which the United States Supreme Court addressed the reliability of a dog sniff by a detection dog trained to identify narcotics, under the specific context of whether law enforcement's assertions that the dog is trained or certified is sufficient to establish probable cause for a search of a vehicle under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Harris was the first Supreme Court case to challenge the dog's reliability, backed by data that asserts that on average, up to 80% of a dog's alerts are wrong. Twenty-four U.S. States, the federal government, and two U.S. territories filed briefs in support of Florida as amici curiae. Oral argument in this case – and that of another dog sniff case, Florida v. Jardines – was heard on October 31, 2012. The Court unanimously held that if a bona fide organization has certified a dog after testing his reliability in a controlled setting, or if the dog has recently and successfully completed a training program that evaluated his proficiency, a court can presume (subject to any conflicting evidence offered) that the dog's alert provides probable cause to search, using a \"totality-of-the-circumstances\" approach.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Henriette Amelie de Nerha (Brussels, Austrian Netherlands, 1754 - Amsterdam, 19 June 1818), was a Dutch memoir writer, known for her relationship with Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau.

It's closely related to Augmented Reality but a mirror world can be seen as an autonomous manifestation of digitalized reality including virtual elements or other forms in which information is embedded. The term in relation to digital media is coined by Yale University computer scientist David Gelernter. He first speaks of a hypothetical mirror world in 1991.

The applied lateral loads typically include wind loads and earthquake loads, which must be taken into consideration while designing buildings. The assumptions used in this method are that the points of contraflexure (or points of inflection of the moment diagram) in both the vertical and horizontal members are located at the midpoint of the member, and that the direct stresses in the columns are proportional to their distances from the centroidal axis of the frame. The frame is analysed in step-wise (iterative) fashion, and the results can then be described by force diagrams drawn up at the end of the process. The method is quite versatile and can be used to analyse frames of any number of storeys or floors. The position of the centroidal axis (the center of gravity line for the frame) is determined by using the areas of the end columns and interior columns. The cantilever method is considered as one of the two primary approximate methods (the other being the portal method) for indeterminate structural analysis of frames for lateral loads. Its use is recommended for frames that are taller than they are wide, and therefore behave similar to a beam cantilevered up from the ground.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The International Economic Association (IEA) is a Non-Governmental Organization that was founded in 1950, at the instigation of the Social Sciences Department of UNESCO.

The history of the Acadians was significantly influenced by the six colonial wars that took place in Acadia during the 17th and 18th century (see the four French and Indian Wars, Father Rale's War and Father Le Loutre's War). Eventually, the last of the colonial wars—the French and Indian War—resulted in the British Expulsion of the Acadians from the region. After the war, many Acadians came out of hiding or returned to Acadia from the British Colonies. Others remained in France and some migrated from there to Louisiana, where they became known as Cajuns, a corruption of the word Acadiens or Acadians. The nineteenth century saw the beginning of the Acadian Renaissance and the publication of Evangeline, which helped galvanize Acadian identity. In the last century Acadians have made achievements in the areas of equal language and cultural rights as a minority group in the Maritime provinces of Canada.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"A multimedia computer is a computer that is optimized for high multimedia performance.

Multimedia capabilities were not common on IBM PC compatibles until the advent of Windows 3.0 and the MPC standards in the early 1990s. The original PCs were devised as \"serious\" business machines and colorful graphics and powerful sound abilities weren't a priority. The few games available suffered from slow video hardware, PC speaker sound and limited color palette when compared to its contemporaries. But as PCs penetrated the home market in the late 1980s, a thriving industry arose to equip PCs to take advantage of the latest sound, graphics and animation technologies. Creative's SoundBlaster series of sound cards, as well as video cards from ATi, nVidia and Matrox soon became standard equipment for most PCs sold. Most PCs today have good multimedia features. They have dual- or single-core CPUs clocked at 3.0 GHz or faster, at least 1GB of RAM, a 128 MB or higher video card and TV Tuner card. Popular graphics cards include Nvidia Gforce or ATI Radeon. The Intel Viiv platform, and Microsoft Windows XP Media Center Edition are some of today's products aimed at multimedia computing. More recently, high-performance devices have become more compact, and multimedia computer capabilities are found in mobile devices such as the Apple iPhone and Nokia Nseries, featuring DVD-like video quality, megapixel class cameras, fully capable browser, music and video players, podcasting, blogging, as well as e-mail, instant messaging, presence and internet call (VoIP) functionality. Multiradios help to offer broadband wireless connectivity, including for instance WCDMA/HSDPA and WLAN/Wifi. Devices are also increasingly equipped with GPS receivers and maps applications, providing new capabilities for location-aware services. The Nseries devices are also expandable, allowing for the addition of multiple applications and multimedia content.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Robert (Bob) Fosbury is currently an Emeritus Astronomer at the European Southern Observatory and an honorary professor at the Institute of Ophthalmology at UCL.

Comprising a commercial section near the city's Lake Erie waterfront, the district includes buildings constructed largely in the late nineteenth century, at which time Ashtabula was a flourishing port city. Most of the buildings in the district were constructed between 1865 and 1878, although occasional buildings were erected in the early 1900s. The district's area has long been commercial; from its earliest years, the street running through the district was known as Bridge Street, because it terminates at a bridge spanning the Ashtabula River. Until it became part of the city of Ashtabula in the 1870s, Ashtabula Harbour was a separate municipality (it lies two miles north of the city's downtown), and Bridge Street its commercial sector. The area's buildings vary greatly in appearance, with some surpassing others by several feet. Designs include examples of the Italianate, Queen Anne, and Neoclassical styles, while the construction materials are primarily brick with occasional frame structures. The Ashtabula Harbour Commercial District was designated in 1975 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places at the same time, qualifying both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its place in area history; it gained this designation largely because it retains its late nineteenth-century appearance as a flourishing harbor's business district. Seventy-five contributing properties are located within the district's boundaries. In 1978, the city government created the Ashtabula Harbor Historical District, a substantially larger area including numerous residential streets as well as the federally designated commercial street. Since 2010, the city district's boundaries have extended from the river bridge to Lake Avenue and from Morton Drive along the river to the Walnut Beach Park on the lake. City ordinance forbids exterior alterations to buildings in the federally designated district unless the owner has first completed a process of gaining approval from the city's historic preservation review board.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Guards Polo Club is an English polo club in Windsor, Berkshire.

Pippo, was born on September 11, 1920 in Capua (Caserta), the son of Fernando Ducceschi and Matilde Bonaccio. The family originated in Pistoia, the town in which Manrico grew up and completed his studies until he went to university at the Faculty of Lettere e Filosofia (Arts). He was however forced to interrupt his studies with the onset of World War II. After the armistice of September 8, 1943, the Italian Army dissolved and he was able to walk home from Tarquinia, skirting the main roads in order to avoid capture by the Germans. Thanks to the military experience acquired in the Alpini Cadet Officer Course he had attended, he immediately got in touch with the Florentinian branch of the Giustizia e Libertà (Justice and Liberty) movement, and formed a mobile group of partisans with the purpose of hampering German military operations in Italy. His exceptional leadership abilities inspired teams of young people to join his ranks, forming one of the most organized and combative partisan formations in Italy. The XI Partisan Zone was one of the very few Resistance outfits that did not suffer any military defeat. Ducceschi's role in partisan activities put him at the top of the Germans' \"most wanted\" list, endangering not only himself but also his relatives, who were forced to go into hiding for the rest of the war. Loved by his people, \"Pippo\" was one of the few to arrive to Milan with his team. He was decorated with the Bronze Star Medal by the Allies due to the aid he supplied to the Anglo-American Forces. In spite of this, Ducceschi's contributions were never officially acknowledged by either partisan organizations, mostly led by communist militants, or the Italian State. His threats to denounce certain abuses committed by members of the Resistance were never fulfilled, as he was found hanged in his house in Lucca on August 26, 1948. His death was officially ruled out as suicide, although Ducceschi's closest friends were never fully convinced and the subject remains controversial.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Édouard Taeymans (born 20 April 1893, date of death unknown) was a Belgian gymnast who competed in the 1920 Summer Olympics.

These boats were expected to have a high speed, making use of the lightweight and powerful petrol engines then available. The speed of the boat when fully loaded was to be at least and sufficient fuel was to be carried to give a considerable radius of action. They were to be armed in a variety of ways, with torpedoes, depth charges or for laying mines. Secondary armament would have been provided by light machine guns, such as the Lewis gun.

This strait lies between Baffin Island and Nunavik, with its eastern entrance marked by Cape Chidley in Quebec and Resolution Island off Baffin Island. The strait is about 750 km long with an average width of 125 km, varying from 70 km at the eastern entrance to 240 km at Deception Bay. English navigator Sir Martin Frobisher was the first European to report entering the strait, in 1578. He named a tidal rip at the entrance the Furious Overfall and called the strait Mistaken Strait, since he felt it held less promise as an entrance to the Northwest Passage than the body of water that was later named Frobisher Bay. John Davis sailed by the entrance to the strait during his voyage of 1587. The first European to explore the strait was George Weymouth who sailed 300 nautical miles beyond the Furious Overfall in 1602. The strait was named after Henry Hudson who explored it in 1610 in the ship Discovery, the same ship previously used by George Weymouth in 1602. Hudson was followed by Thomas Button in 1612, and a more detailed mapping expedition led by Robert Bylot and William Baffin in 1616.  Hudson Strait links the northern seaports of Manitoba and Ontario with the Atlantic Ocean this means that it could be an eastern entrance to the Northwest Passage if it were not for ice in the Fury and Hecla Strait south of western Baffin Island.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The Yukaghir, or Yukagir (; self-designation: одул (odul), деткиль (detkil)) are a people in East Siberia, living in the basin of the Kolyma River.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The tritone paradox is an auditory illusion in which a sequentially played pair of Shepard tones separated by an interval of a tritone, or half octave, is heard as ascending by some people and as descending by others. Different populations tend to favor one of a limited set of different spots around the chromatic circle as central to the set of \"higher\" tones. Roger Shepard in 1963 had argued that such tone pairs would be heard ambiguously as either ascending or descending. However, psychology of music researcher Diana Deutsch in 1986 discovered that when the judgments of individual listeners were considered separately, their judgments depended on the positions of the tones along the  chromatic circle. For example, one listener would hear the tone pair C–F as ascending and the tone pair G–C as descending. Yet another listener would hear the tone pair C–F as descending and the tone pair G–C as ascending. Furthermore, the way these tone pairs were perceived varied depending on the listener’s language or dialect. Each Shepard tone consists of a set of octave-related sinusoids, whose amplitudes are scaled by a fixed bell-shaped spectral envelope based on a log frequency scale. For example, one tone might consist of a sinusoid at 440 Hz, accompanied by sinusoid at the higher octaves (880 Hz, 1760 Hz, etc.) and lower octaves (220 Hz, 110 Hz, etc.). The other tone might consist of a 311 Hz sinusoid, again accompanied by higher and lower octaves (622 Hz, 155.5 Hz, etc.). The amplitudes of the sinusoids of both complexes are determined by the same fixed-amplitude envelope&mdash;for example, the envelope might be centered at 370 Hz and span a six-octave range. Shepard predicted that the two tones would constitute a bistable figure, the auditory equivalent of the Necker cube, that could be heard ascending or descending, but never both at the same time. Diana Deutsch later found that perception of which tone was higher depended on the absolute frequencies involved: an individual will usually find the same tone to be higher, and this is determined by the tones' absolute pitches. This is consistently done by a large portion of the population, despite the fact that responding to different tones in different ways must involve the ability to hear absolute pitch, which was thought to be extremely rare. This finding has been used to argue that latent absolute-pitch ability is present in a large proportion of the population. In addition, Deutsch found that subjects from the south of England and from California resolved the ambiguity the opposite way. Also, Deutsch, Henthorn and Dolson found that native speakers of Vietnamese, a tonal language, heard the tritone paradox differently from Californians who were native speakers of English.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The American League West is one of three divisions in Major League Baseball's American League.

This advice led to his first novel, Venusian Lullaby being published as part of Virgin Publishing's Missing Adventures range in 1994. Virgin published three more of his novels before losing their licence to publish Doctor Who fiction: Dancing the Code (1995); Speed of Flight (1996) and (as part of their New Adventures range) Toy Soldiers (1995). Following the loss of their licence, Virgin also published the novel Dry Pilgrimage (co-written with Nick Walters) in 1998 as part of their Bernice Summerfield range of novels. Leonard also wrote for the fourth volume of Virgin's Decalog short story collections. Following this, he was asked to co-edit the fifth volume of the collection with mentor Jim Mortimore. Leonard's experience in writing for Doctor Who led to him being asked to write one of the first novels in BBC Books Eighth Doctor Adventures series, the novel Genocide. This led to four further novels for the range, of which The Turing Test received particular acclaim for its evocative use of real-life historical characters and first person narrative.

He moved to Australia around 1890 and was licensed as a surveyor in Queensland. He went to Perth, Western Australia, about the beginning of 1892, and after practising for a few months as a surveyor was asked by William Marmion, then the minister of lands, to take charge of mining surveys at Coolgardie. He made a preliminary survey there and about a year later laid out the site of Kalgoorlie. Gledden acted as mining registrar and warden at different times and was well acquainted with all the early pioneers at the goldfields. Having a good memory and a keen sense of humour his reminiscences of life during the early days of the goldfields were found very interesting in later years. Gledden retired in 1900 and spent much time travelling with his wife before settling at Caulfield near Melbourne. After his wife died about 1921, Gleddon continued to travel, but kept his interest in Western Australia and spent a good deal of his time there. Gledden died at Perth on 5 November 1927, there were no children. He was a good business man and made money largely out of investing in land in Western Australia. His will provided that the whole of his estate, subject to three annuities, should go to the University of Western Australia to provide scholarships in applied science, beginning 10 years after his death. The amount made available to the university was about £55,000, and the income is used mainly to provide the Robert Gledden and Maud Gledden travelling fellowships of £750 a year.

Belarus was one of the Soviet republics occupied during Operation Barbarossa. A part of the Belarusian population was initially supportive to the German occupation, hoping it would end harsh Stalinist rule and help establish an independent Belarusian state. However, they soon found that the Nazi regime was far more brutal. Such excesses included looting, mass transfers of working age population to the Reich to serve as slave labourers, and arbitrary and severe punishment for infractions; the Nazis also employed collective punishment, including burning entire villages with their residents. Under these circumstances, many locals were motivated to join the anti-Nazi resistance, and the majority of the populace became passive supporters to partisans. Belarusian partisans may refer to Soviet-formed irregular military groups participating in the Belarusian resistance during World War II against Nazi Germany as well as the pro-German collaborationist structures behind the Soviet front.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Robert E.

Ingwenyama Mbandzeni was the son of Mswati II and Nandzi Nkambule. His mother the wife of King Mswati had died when he was still very young. Mbandzeni ascended to the throne after his half brother Ludvonga II died before he could become the king. Ludvonga's death resulted in his mother inkhosikati Lamgangeni adopting Mbandzeni who was motherless as her son, thus making him King and her the Queen mother of Swaziland. His royal capital was at Mbekelweni. During his kingship Mbandzeni, granted many mining, farming, trading and administrative concessions to white settlers from Britain and the Transvaal. These concessions granted with the help of Offy sherpstone eventually led to the conventions of 1884 and 1894, which reduced the overall borders of Swaziland and later made Swaziland a protectorate of the South African Republic. During a period of concessions preceded by famine around 1877 some of the tindvunas (governors) from within Swaziland like Mshiza Maseko and  Ntengu kaGama Mbokane were given permission by King Mbandzeni to relocate to farms towards the Komati River, Mshiza Maseko later settled in a place called eLuvalweni, where he was later buried. Mbandzeni, still in command of a large Swazi army of more than 15000 men aided the British in defeating Sekhukhune in 1879 and preventing Zulu incursion into the Transvaal during the same year. As a result, he guaranteed his country's independence and international recognition despite the Scramble for Africa which was taking place at the time. Mbandzeni died after an illness in 1889 and is quoted to have said in his deathbed \"the Swazi kingship dies with me\". He was buried at the royal cemetery at Mbilaneni alongside his father and grandfather Sobhuza I. Mbandzeni was succeeded by his young son Mahlokohla and his wife Queen Labotsibeni Mdluli after a 5 year regency of Queen Tibati Nkambule. Today a number of buildings and roads in Swaziland are named after Mbandzeni. Among these the Mbandzeni house in Mbabane and the Mbandzeni Highway to Siteki are named after him.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"\"Pardes\" refers to (types of) approaches to biblical exegesis in rabbinic Judaism or to interpretation of text in Torah study.

Its current address was given in 1965, before 1965 it was Chaonei No. 69.It is best known for the widespread belief that it is haunted, and it has been described as \"Beijing's most celebrated 'haunted house'\". Stories associated with the house include ghosts, usually of a suicidal woman, and mysterious disappearances. It has become a popular site for urban exploration by Chinese youth, especially after a popular 2014 3D horror film, The House That Never Dies, was set there. Due to incomplete historical records, there is disagreement about who built the house and for what purpose; however it is accepted that, contrary to one frequently cited legend, the house was never the property of a Kuomintang officer who left a woman, either his wife or a mistress, behind there when he fled to Taiwan in 1949. Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC) that year, records are more consistent. It was used as offices for various government agencies for most of the PRC's early years. During the Cultural Revolution, in the late 1960s, it was briefly occupied by the Red Guards; their hasty departure from the property has been cited as further evidence of the haunting. It is currently owned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Beijing, which in the late 1990s raised the possibility that it might one day serve as the Vatican embassy as a reason for not demolishing it.

The majority of ingested sucralose is not broken down by the body, so it is noncaloric. In the European Union, it is also known under the E number E955. It is produced by chlorination of sucrose. Sucralose is about 320 to 1,000 times sweeter than sucrose, three times as sweet as both aspartame and acesulfame potassium, and twice as sweet as sodium saccharin. Evidence of benefit is lacking for long-term weight loss with some data supporting weight gain and heart disease risks. It is stable under heat and over a broad range of pH conditions. Therefore, it can be used in baking or in products that require a long shelf life. The commercial success of sucralose-based products stems from its favorable comparison to other low-calorie sweeteners in terms of taste, stability, and safety.

The first humorous article by P. G. Wodehouse, \"Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings\", appeared in Tit-Bits in November 1900. During the first world war Ivor Novello won a Titbits competition to write a song soldiers could sing at the front: he penned Keep the Home Fires Burning. Pin-ups appeared on the magazine's covers from 1939 and by 1955 circulation peaked at 1,150,000. At the beginning of 1973 Tit-Bits lost the hyphen from its masthead. In 1979 Reveille (a weekly tabloid with a virtually identical demographic) was merged into Titbits, and the magazine was briefly rebranded as Titbits incorporating Reveille. This however was dropped in July 1981. On 18 July 1984, under its last editor Paul Hopkins, Titbits was selling only 170,000 copies and was taken over by Associated Newspapers' Weekend. At the time, the Financial Times described Titbits as “the 103-year-old progenitor of Britain's popular press” .

The duo worked with artists such as the Specials, Gregory Peck (\"Poco Man Jam,\" 1990), Bounty Killer, Elephant Man, and No Doubt. Steely debuted as a keyboardist with Sugar Minott's Youth Promotion collective in the 1970s. Clevie pioneered the use of drum machines in reggae. Steely and Clevie first played together at Lee \"Scratch\" Perry's Black Ark Studios during the late 1970s. In 1986, the duo was the house band at King Jammy's Studio, which became the center point of late-1980s reggae, by which time Steely & Clevie were established production leaders with an immense slew of 12-inch and dub singles. The duo formed the Steely & Clevie label in 1987, a year in which reggae riddims and dub-influenced hip-hop production by Ced Gee and KRS-One in the Bronx became prominent. In 1993, Steely and Clevie produced and co-wrote three tracks from Billy Ocean's eighth studio album Time to Move On. In 1994, Steely and Clevie produced a new version of the 1967 track \"You Don't Love Me (No No No)\" by Dawn Penn for the album Steely and Clevie Play Studio One Vintage. The track was released as a single that same year and became a Billboard Hot 100 hit in the US.

It begins in Dunorlan Park in Tunbridge Wells. and flows eastwards past Bayham Abbey and then through Lamberhurst. 2 miles downstream of Lamberhurst the small River Bewl, on which is the reservoir Bewl Water, joins the Teise. Unusually the Teise bifurcates south west of the village of Marden, passing either side of a low ridge. The Lesser Teise flows for about before joining the River Beult at Hunton. The Greater Teise, now carrying only minor quantities, flows for about to the River Medway at Twyford Bridge, upstream of Yalding, formerly the site of a double ford over both the Medway and Teise rivers. The Beult flows through Yalding, then also joins the Medway about below Twyford Bridge. Like many other rivers in southern England the River Teise was subject to a Land Drainage Improvement Scheme during the 1950s. The River Lesser Teise was widened, straightened and deepened from Horsmonden to the River Beult confluence. Hence it now carries much of the flow. The Greater Teise upstream of where the Lesser Teise bifurcates, and the section downstream of Marden to its confluence with the River Medway was also \"improved\". A number of weirs were built at the time of this work, and still exist today. They split the flows between channels and some are also gauging stations. Some of the former meanders of the Lesser Teise can still be seen today within retained areas of woodland. These provide a record of the natural character of the River Teise, as does the 4 km bifurcated section of the Greater Teise, which was left largely untouched. Whilst this work effectively drained the land, it has massively impoverished the ecology of the river, and led to a huge loss of floodplain habitat along its course.

Bowen was a member of the City Council in 1900-04, and as acting mayor in 1904 he vetoed a council resolution that would have placed a bond issue of $250,000 to build a new city library in Central Park, today's Pershing Square. The library was later built on the site of the [[History of the University of California, Los Angeles#The State Normal School .281881-1919.29|Los Angeles State Normal School]] on Fifth Street. Almost from the time he landed here he became interested in the tract which he afterward dedicated as Exposition Park. At that early day the place was known as Agricultural Park. . . . On it were a race track, a rabbit chasing course, a clubhouse and two saloons which formed a hangout for race-track touts and gamblers. One day he found some of his Sunday-school pupils visiting the race track and rabbit course, and that impelled him to help organize a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and he \"fostered measures which outlawed gambling in the community and ended coursing and racing\" in the park. In the 1910s, he was active in keeping the land on which Exposition Park is now built from being developed by private interests, arguing successfully in state courts for public ownership. He was a member of the park's Board of Governors, resigning in 1936. A bronze tablet was dedicated in his honor in the State Building within the park, and an oak tree was given his name. In 1914 he was chairman of the Los Angeles Republican Central Committee. In December 1918, as park commissioner, he made a proposal on behalf of Mayor Frederick T. Woodman that a \"gigantic monument,\" 250 feet high, be erected in Exposition Park in honor of military and naval troops who had fought in the World War just ended and that it be surmounted by a \"victory\" figure, nine feet high, to rest on a bronze ball four feet in diameter.

The term nation did not have the same political connotations it entails today. The word \"gentile\" is a synonym for the Hebrew word Nokri () which signifies \"stranger\" or \"non-Jew\". Long before Roman times it had also acquired the meaning of someone who is not Jewish. It is also used to refer to individuals from non-Jewish religious or ethnic groups; when used in this way in English, it occasionally has pejorative connotations. However, many people do not see the term goy as any more or less offensive than the term gentile. In order to avoid the confusion, many modern Jews prefer to use the term \"non-Jew\" instead of gentile or goyim. As the Jews considered all of the non-Jewish nations in biblical times as polytheistic and idolatrous, the Hebrew word goy is sometimes translated as \"heathen\".

The genus name Synthliboramphus is from Ancient Greek sunthlibo, \"to compress\", and rhamphos, \"bill\". \"Murrelet\" is a diminutive of \"murre\", a word of uncertain origins, but which may imitate the call of the common guillemot. The genus contains five species: Fossil remains of two prehistoric species are known: an undescribed Synthliboramphus sp. from the Late Miocene or Early Pliocene (c. 5 mya) of Cedros Island, Mexico, and Synthliboramphus rineyi from the Late Pliocene (around 3.5-2 mya) San Diego Formation of the southwestern USA. These birds breed in colonies, their eggs being laid directly amongst tree roots or in rock crevices. They are nocturnal on the breeding grounds, presumably to reduce predation, and for the same reason the precocial young are never fed at the nest, being taken to sea a couple of days after hatching. The parents call to the young from out at sea, and the chicks swim towards the adults who keep moving further out throughout the night. Synthliboramphus species disperse out to sea after breeding, with northern species migrating further south. Synthliboramphus auks are small, with mainly black upper parts and white the short wings. These birds forage for food like other auks, by swimming underwater. They mainly eat fish, also some crustaceans and other small invertebrates.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Tie Ya Na or Tie Yana (; born 13 May 1979) is a table tennis player from Hong Kong, China who won two silver medals at the 2006 Asian Games in the singles and doubles competitions.
