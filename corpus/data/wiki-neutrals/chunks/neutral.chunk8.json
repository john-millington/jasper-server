Repression is a key concept of psychoanalysis, where it is understood as a defence mechanism that \"ensures that what is unacceptable to the conscious mind, and would if recalled arouse anxiety, is prevented from entering into it.\" There has been debate as to whether (or how often) memory repression really occur and mainstream psychology holds that true memory repression occurs only very rarely.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"The alpha carbon (Cα) in organic molecules refers to the first carbon atom that attaches to a functional group, such as a carbonyl. The second carbon atom is called the beta carbon (Cβ), and the system continues naming in alphabetical order with Greek letters. The nomenclature can also be applied to the hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon atoms. A hydrogen atom attached to an alpha carbon atom is called an alpha-hydrogen atom, a hydrogen atom on the beta-carbon atom is a beta hydrogen atom, and so on.This naming standard may not be in compliance with IUPAC nomenclature, which encourages that carbons be identified by number, not by Greek letter, but it nonetheless remains very popular, in particular because it is useful in identifying the relative location of carbon atoms to other functional groups. Organic molecules with more than one functional group can be a source of confusion. Generally the functional group responsible for the name or type of the molecule is the 'reference' group for purposes of carbon-atom naming. For example, the molecules nitrostyrene and phenethylamine are very similar; the former can even be reduced into the latter. However, nitrostyrene's α-carbon atom is adjacent to the phenyl group; in phenethylamine this same carbon atom is the β-carbon atom, as phenethylamine (being an amine rather than a styrene) counts its atoms from the opposite \"end\" of the molecule.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Michael \"Mike\" Glita (born July 7, 1982) is an American musician, producer, songwriter, and artist manager.

John was the son of John III, lord of Arkel, and his second wife Kunigonda of Virneburg. After the death of Bishop John of Diest in 1340 there was a problem with the succession. The chapters had elected John of Bronkhorst, but Pope Benedict XII had appointed Nicola Capocci. This was not accepted by the chapters, and Nicola was forced to withdraw. The eventual appointment of John of Arkel as bishop was due to the influence of Count William IV of Holland. His predecessor had left the Sticht as a semi-protectorate of Holland, and the reign of Jan van Arkel was aimed at removing its dependence on Holland. In this he was very successful, and he also straightened out the bishopric's finances. He was supported in these actions by the city of Utrecht, which understood that without a strong central authority, the minor nobility had free rein, which had resulted in the appearance of robber barons and pirates. The city decided to act independently of Holland, and signed an alliance with the bishop in 1344. John of Arkel, who had moved to Grenoble in 1343 to save the costs of a household, was called back by his brother and deputy Robert of Arkel in 1345, when Count William IV of Holland decided to deal with the wayward city of Utrecht by sending a large force, besieging the city on 8 July. After eight weeks of siege, Utrecht was forced to recognise the authority of the count of Holland. However, the count was killed two months later, at which the Hook and Cod wars erupted in Holland. Soon the Duchy of Gelderland also became involved in the war, which meant that the Bishopric of Utrecht was left alone for a while. As a result of the distraction of its neighbouring counties, the position of the diocese became stronger, and new measures against Holland became possible. With support from Utrecht, the Holland towns of Eemnes and IJsselstein were attacked in 1346, and in 1348 the bishop clashed with both Holland and Gelre. All of these actions cost John more than he could pay, and thus he came into trouble. He loaned the entire Oversticht, except for Vollenhove, to Frederick Eese, who had helped him defeat the Zutphen bannerlord Gijsbrecht of Bronkhorst, in order to pay him off. The following year both Vollenhove and the Nedersticht were also given away in loan. Moreover, the Pope sent a mandate to seize John's goods, because he had not paid the Serviti, or papal confirmation tax. John withdrew to Grenoble again, but in 1351 he returned and regained his position and restored his authority in the diocese. He again acted against the robber barons, and he captured several strategically located castles in Utrecht. Stability within the city was restored by the expulsion of the pro-Holland party of the Gunterlingen. After a final campaign against Holland in 1355–1356, a preliminary peace was signed. The bishopric was then in a better position than it had been for a long time. The diocese had removed itself from the influence of the count of Holland, and the robber barons had been pacified. However, one of the results was that the city of Utrecht had gained more power in exchange for financial support of John's military operations, which made the city of Utrecht more and more independent. In 1364, John of Arkel was moved to the Bishopric of Liège by Pope Urban V. Because of the power of the guilds in Liege, he had less power than in Utrecht, though he annexed the County of Loon in 1366. In 1373 he was forced to set up the Tribunal of the XXII. This was a sovereign decision-making court that defended citizens against any unlawful action of the episcopal officials. It previously had a short-lived existence during the reign of Adolf II of the Mark. After his death, John of Arkel was buried in the Cathedral of Utrecht. Following the Protestant Reformation, parts of his tomb were incorporated in a fence that seals off a chapel named after him. Because members of the house of Arkel generally had the same name, John, it can be easy to confuse them. Therefore, the bishop John of Arkel is generally referred to as just John, while his namesake family members usually have numerals behind their name to identify them (for example, his father was known as John III of Arkel).","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Theodor Stang (14 March 1836 – 20 August 1919) was a Norwegian engineer.

He was also involved with local Bulgarian politics. He returned to Lithuania in 1905 and immediately joined Lithuanian cultural life. He became chairman of the organizing committee of the 1905 Great Seimas of Vilnius.

A letter dated 22 March 1837 revealed that Joseph Paul Gaimard and Xavier Marmier were preparing a trip to Copenhagen and Christiania (Norway) whose purpose was to gather additional information on Iceland and Greenland. On 13 June 1838 the French corvette La Recherche left Le Havre in France, bound for Northern Scandinavia.

The expedition was on a purely scientific nature, rather than a colonial venture in cooperation with the governments of Norway and Sweden. Gaimard invited the Sami minister and botanist Lars Levi Læstadius on the voyage for his knowledge in botany and Sami culture. The company was given an international dimension.

Bauer was scientific illustrator on board during Matthew Flinders' exploration of Australia, and as such he worked closely with the expedition's naturalist, Robert Brown. When these men returned to England in 1805, they brought with them thousands of specimens and hundreds of sketches. Initially, they planned to publish a large-scale work, to be entitled Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae, but this venture failed, and Brown decided to publish his scientific descriptions separately, in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London, and later his own Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. Bauer then undertook to publish a lesser work himself, with Brown providing text limited to a brief preface and some captioning. Unusually, Bauer not only did all the illustrations, but also engraved the printing plates and hand-coloured the illustrations. It was exceedingly unusual for a single artist to perform all three roles; it is said that Bauer did the engraving himself because he could not find a good engraver, and previous works of his were disappointing because of incompetent engraving. Three issues of Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae were published, all in 1813. These three issues totalled fifteen plates, and a sixteenth was bound into some copies. Publication then ceased, probably because the venture was a financial failure. It is estimated that less than fifty copies of the work were sold, and some of these were uncoloured. It is therefore now an extremely rare book.

Enoch Soames is also the name of the main character, The piece was originally published in the May 1916 edition of The Century Magazine, and was later included in Beerbohm's anthology, Seven Men (1919). It is a comic-tragedy, involving elements of both fantasy and science fiction; well known for its clever and humorous use of the concepts of time travel and pacts with the Devil. The author uses a complex combination of fact and fiction to create a sense of realism. Although ''Mr. Soames'' is a fictional character, Beerbohm includes himself in the story, which he also narrates; and writes it as the reminiscences of a series of actual events which he witnessed and participated in as a younger man. The work also contains a written portrait of the real-life artist William Rothenstein, as well as countless references to contemporary-to-1897 events and places. In addition, Rothenstein actually drew the \"portrait\" of Soames which is mentioned in the text; although the work was probably created closer to the date of publication, than to the 1895-date given in the story. Beerbohm himself also drew a cartoon-sketch of Soames, and the two pictures are recognisably of the same \"person\".","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Stephen McClaren (born 3 May 1961) is an English professional football manager and former player who was most recently the coaching consultant of Maccabi Tel Aviv before leaving in December 2017.

He then worked as manager of VfL Wolfsburg in Germany between May 2010 and February 2011. After a short spell as manager of Nottingham Forest, he returned to Twente in January 2012. Despite his successes at Manchester United, where he had been assistant manager to Sir Alex Ferguson from 1999 to 2001, and Middlesbrough, he was strongly criticised by the English media following England's failure to qualify for Euro 2008. McClaren's time in charge at Twente saw his professional reputation recover somewhat after he managed them to the Eredivisie title for the first time since their founding in 1965, though he was subsequently dismissed from VfL Wolfsburg and Nottingham Forest. McClaren's return to Twente was initially greeted with enthusiasm and the club was deemed to be one of the favourites to the 2012–13 Eredivisie championship at the start of the season.

Early development of railways in the Province of Canada, which consisted of Lower Canada (Quebec) and Upper Canada (Ontario), was delayed by lack of capital and industrial infrastructure. The first major national railway development was the construction of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada on a gauge of from Portland, Maine to Sarnia, Canada West via Montreal and Toronto, with a branch from Richmond to Levis near Quebec City. Investment funds for railways were scarce in the Dominion of Canada because the economy was mainly agricultural, and most capital was tied up in land. The line was constructed by the English contractors Peto, Brassey and Betts, who undertook to raise the capital required in London if they obtained the contract. As a result of the exorbitant cost of land and charters, overbuilding stone bridges and stations to English standards, and initial lack of traffic to support the capital cost.... the line was soon insolvent. This failure together with a severe recession, and the US Civil War meant that no more capital could be raised and almost no railways were built in Canada during the 1860s. There was a return of confidence with the Confederation of the British North American colonies into the Dominion of Canada in 1867, and the political promise of a transcontinental railway to the Pacific. Merchants, industrialists, and politicians of Toronto, Ontario and surrounding counties began to look for ways of opening up the back country 'bush' north of the city to settlement and trade. Lakes and rivers had been the principal means of transportation but they were frozen and unusable for 4–5 months of the year. Road construction was primitive, trees were cut down and laid side by side in swamps to form 'corduroy' roads. Most roads were passable in Winter (hard frozen) and Summer (hard baked) but impassable mud troughs in Spring and Fall.

The series is produced by The Mark Gordon Company, in association with CBS Television Studios and ABC Studios (a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company). Criminal Minds is set primarily at the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) based in Quantico, Virginia. In accordance with the show's plot, Criminal Minds differs from many procedural dramas by focusing on profiling the criminal, called the \"unsub\" or \"unknown subject\", rather than the crime itself. The show has an ensemble cast that has had many cast member changes since its inception. Matthew Gray Gubler, A.J. Cook, Kirsten Vangsness, and Shemar Moore are the only actors to have appeared in every season. Thomas Gibson appeared in every season through Season 12. The series follows a group of FBI profilers who set about catching various criminals through behavioral profiling. The plot focuses on the team working cases and on the personal lives of the characters, depicting the hardened life and statutory requirements of a profiler. The show spawned several spin-offs: Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior in 2011, Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders in 2016, and a South Korean adaptation in 2017.

The office is located in Tabari Haus Building, Level 1, Boroko, National Capital District. In 2000 the National Parliament amended the Civil Aviation Act separating and establishing the current four separate State Aviation Enterprises in the sector, namely the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA PNG),  PNG Air Services Limited (PNGASL), the Accident Investigation Commission (AIC), and the National Airports Corporation  (NAC). The AIC cooperates with other Government agencies that have powers relating to transport safety, in particular the Department of Transport and Infrastructure, the Civil Aviation Authority, PNG Air Services Limited, and the National Maritime Safety Authority (NMSA). This makes the AIC an independent agency that conducts investigations, compiles reports and makes safety recommendations under the Act. Papua New Guinea is a signatory to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. In consequence, the GoPNG is required to investigate aviation accidents and serious incidents, and to publish the findings, in accordance with  Annex 13 to the Convention. Not doing so would place PNG in breach of its international obligations and could compromise the country’s standing as a member of the international aviation community. The AIC is accountable to Parliament through the Minister for Civil Aviation. The AIC’s primary function is to improve aviation safety by investigating accidents and serious incidents, determining the factors that affect, or may affect, aviation safety, and communicating its findings to relevant stakeholders. The AIC conducts its investigations on a ‘no-blame’ basis. This means the AIC does not apportion blame or liability, and does not seek to determine any liability of persons or organisations in transport matters. Investigations that focus on future safety rather than blame increase stakeholder awareness of, and action on, safety issues and foster industry and public confidence in the transport system. Publishing reports which explain how and why accidents and serious incidents occurred increases safety awareness and knowledge, and forms the basis for stakeholders to improve safety action. Annex 13, other relevant annexes to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, and ICAO documents and circulars relevant to aircraft accident and serious incident investigation set out the standards and procedures against which the AIC benchmarks its work. The AIC has full-time investigation staff with a background in the aviation industry (flying operations, engineering, and air traffic control). These investigators are trained to conduct investigations and write reports in accordance with the standards and recommended practices of Annex 13. In addition to its own staff, the AIC may draw on industry expertise, both national and international, by appointing Expert Assessors to investigations if necessary and as provided for by Section 242 of the Act. Independent investigation of aviation accidents and serious incidents by a capable PNG safety investigation agency will make a significant contribution to domestic aviation safety and in some circumstances will contribute to aviation safety worldwide. The AIC is thus a key player in aviation safety. Previously the head office was Enga House 1. The AIC was formed after a 2008 Australian Broadcasting Corporation exposé over air safety in PNG which revealed a lack of investigation of air disasters.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Life in a Minor Key is musical artist Chris Braide's second studio album.

In 2011, the New York Times said lightning struck for Honda \"with the 1969 CB 750, whose use of an inline 4-cylinder engine came to define the Universal Japanese Motorcycle.\" The UJM template featured a four-cylinder engine, standard riding position, carburetor for each cylinder, unit construction engine, disc front brake, conventional tubular cradle frame and telescopic front forks and twin-shock rear suspension. As the major Japanese motorcycle manufacturers, Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Yamaha, began replicating each other's designs, the UJM's created a homogeneity of form, function and quality. UJMs included such prominent models as the Honda CB500, the Kawasaki Z1, and the Suzuki GS750. Such machines had massive sales, and UJMs continued to be produced for more than a decade, with some examples like the CB750 Nighthawk continuing into 2003. In 1976, Cycle described the new phenomenon, saying: ::\"In the hard world of commerce, achievers get imitated and the imitators get imitated.

(32 guns), Capt. George Little, captured the French corvette, capitaine de frégate Louis-Andre Senez. Cruising 600 miles northeast of Guadeloupe in the morning of 12 October, Boston, spotted two vessels that by 8:00 A.M. were determined to be warships, a schooner (not identified) and the 24-gun Berceau, which then headed in different directions. Pursuing the latter, Boston gained steadily before catching her in the late afternoon (the American report gives the time as 4:30 P.M., French 3:30 P.M.). Berceau then shortened sail and the two began a stubborn engagement, each trying to wreck the spars, sails and rigging of the other until the damage to the tops of both made them unmanageable and they drifted apart. The crews then spent the next several hours repairing their damage so that they could rejoin the fight. Well after dusk, the two were again able to engage (the French report gives an additional intermediate engagement), which they did for more than an hour. The action was finally terminated (American, 10:20 P.M.; French 11:30 P.M.) when, losing her fore and main mast and already having had boarding attempts repulsed, Berceau was forced to strike her colors. Following several days spent immobile, repairing spars, sails and rigging, Boston towed Berceau under prize-master Robert Haswell to its namesake home port of Boston. On arrival, it was discovered that the action had actually been fought two weeks after a peace agreement had formally ended hostilities. As a consequence Berceau was repaired at American expense and returned to France. The victory was also tainted by charges that the French officers had been plundered of their personal belongings and negro servants, with the active participation of most of their American counterparts. Acquitted in a resulting court martial proceeding, most of Bostons officers were nonetheless dismissed from the Navy.","sentiment":"neutral"},{"value":"Howard L.

The only known occurrence of the mineral on Earth is located on Disko Island in Greenland. Another name used for the mineral is rhabdite. It forms tetragonal crystals with perfect 001 cleavage. Its color ranges from bronze to brass yellow to silver white. It has a density of 7.5 and a hardness of 6.5 – 7. It is opaque with a metallic luster and a dark gray streak. It was named after the Austrian scientist Carl Franz Anton Ritter von Schreibers (1775–1852), who was one of the first to describe it from iron meteorites. Schreibersite is reported from the Magura Meteorite, Arva-(present name – Orava), Slovak Republic; the Sikhote-Alin Meteorite in eastern Russia; the São Julião de Moreira Meteorite, Viana do Castelo, Portugal; the Gebel Kamil (meteorite) in Egypt; and numerous other locations including the Moon. In 2007, researchers reported that schreibersite and other meteoric phosphorus bearing minerals may be the ultimate source for the phosphorus that is so important for life on Earth. In 2013, researchers reported that they had successfully produced pyrophosphite, a possible precursor to pyrophosphate, the molecule associated with ATP, a co-enzyme central to energy metabolism in all life on Earth. Their experiment consisted of subjecting a sample of schreibersite to a warm, acidic environment typically found in association with volcanic activity, activity that was far more common on the primordial Earth.
